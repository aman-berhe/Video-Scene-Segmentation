00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,709
Where dld It come from?
And why Is It here?

101
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,358
I earned It, and you're golng

-What? Why?
-Walt, I don't thlnk we--

103
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,358

You wlll tell hlm that It Is hls

108
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,070
...but wlth the hope

109
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,273
-And for the betterment of hls I'amlly.
-Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

110
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:40,071
Why....?

111
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,475
I mean, why, In partlcular, would we--?

112
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,672
It you wanna glve your klds drug money,

113
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,108
I can't.

114
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,436
My wll'e and son hate me.

115
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,029
They won't take my money.

116
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:53,638
Even If they dld...

117
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,673
...the federal government
wouldn't let them.

118
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,591
But two rlch benel'actors who are known
for thelr charltable endeavours...

119
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,710
...who would thlnk nothlng of,

120
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,711
...wrltlng a $28 mllllon cheque...

121
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,356
...to help vlctlms
ol' methamphetamlne abuse?

122
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,632
l have to thlnk that your money
would be very welcome.

123
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,955
It wouldn't make any sense
comlng from us.

124
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,752
It certalnly would.

125
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:22,271
My chlldren are blameless vlctlms
ol' thelr monstrous I'ather.

126
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,869
A man who you once knew qulte well.

127
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,235
Call It a beau geste,
call It llberal gullt...

128
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,509
...call It whatever you want, but do It.

129
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:42,708
And you are not to spend
a slngle dlme of your own money.

130
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:48,755
If there are taxes or lawyers' I'ees owed,
you wlll take It rlght from here.

131
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,348
They use my money, never yours.

132
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,117
Okay, Walt, sure.

133
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,039
That sounds reasonable.

134
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,232
So, what happens next?

135
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,551
I guess we shake on It, and I leave.

136
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,228
I can trust you to do thls.

137
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,668
Yes.

138
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,713
Absolutely you can.

139
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,711
Don't move. Don't--
Don't dare move a muscle.

140
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,118
You don't want them to thlnk that
you're trylng to get away. Just breathe.

141
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,193
Just thls afternoon,
I had an extra $200,000...

142
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,914
...that I would have loved dearly
to leave on top of thls table.

143
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:18,832
Instead, I gave It to the two best
hlt men west of the Mlsslsslppl.

144
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,915
...whatever happens to me tomorrow...

145
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,435
...they'll stlll be out there.

146
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,991
Keeplng tabs.

147
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:36,029
And II', for any reason...

148
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,994
...that my chlldren
do not get thls money...

149
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,478
...a klnd ol' countdown wlll begln.

150
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,116
Maybe a day or so later,
maybe a week, a year...

151
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
...when you're golng tor a walk
In Santa Fe...

152
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,076
...or Manhattan or Prague, wherever...

153
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,400
...and you're talklng
about your stock prlces...

154
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,272
...wlthout a worry In the world.

155
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,429
And then suddenly...

156
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,552
...you'll hear the scrape
of a I'ootstep behlnd you...

157
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,796
...but before you can even turn around:

Darkness.

159
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:29,231
Cheer up, beautll'ul people.

It's easy,
and It wlll keep you In buslness.

214
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,916
And, Todd, I could teach It to you.

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,672

250
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,357
Wall's In town.

251
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,995
Yeah?

252
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,634
That car they thought he stole
In New Hampshlre...

253
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,876
...they found It In a Denny's parklng lot
rlght on Central.

254
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,594
And your next-door nelghbour,
on the rlght-- What's her name, Becky?

255
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,315
-Becky's on the left. Carol's on the rlght.
-Becky, Carol, whatever.

256
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,475
She saw hlm at your old house.

257
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,715
Just thls mornlng, plaln as day.

258
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,231
He's there, walklng out of your house,
and he calls her by name.

259
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,638
-He dldn't hurt her, dld he? He dldn't--?
-No, he's Just llke, 'Hey, Beckyl'

260
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,434
0r Carol, whatever.

261
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:52,994
She sald he looked exactly
llke the Unabomber.

262
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,431
But she's posltlve It was hlm.
They're gettlng calls from all over town.

263
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,551
He's here, he's there,
he's golng to blow up clty hall.

264
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,751
He has some sort of manlfesto.
He wants to be on the news.

265
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,191
-Who's maklng these calls? Hlm?
-There are two or three volces.

266
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,029
They're not sure If they're crank calls
or people he's put up to It...

267
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,036
...or If they're actual anonymous tlps.

268
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,912
It's stretchlng them thln,
whlch ls maybe the polnt.

269
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,438
As far as I'm concerned...

270
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,349
...there are three places that he
would go: To you, to me, or Flynn.

271
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,992
mam.

272
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,918
They're watchlng the hlgh school.

273
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,111
They're probably watchlng
your place too.

274
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,752


275
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,869
...I know that's what Hank would do.

276
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,471
There Is no way Walt's gettlng to you.
They are absolutely golng to catch hlm.

277
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:37,634
No doubt about It.

278
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,628
That arrogant asshole thlnks he's some
crlmlnal mastermlnd, but he's not.

279
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,117
But on the off chance....

280
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,117
Yeah.

281
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,915

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,118
Flve mlnutes.

287
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,356

00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,600
-You dldn't hurt anybody?

289
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,633

00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,833
You look terrlble.

291
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,797
Yeah.

292
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,638
But I feel good.

293
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,357
So talk.

294
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,158
Why are you here?

295
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,112
It's over.

296
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,670
And I needed a proper goodbye.

297
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:32,749
Not our last phone call.

298
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,958
So you're golng to the pollce?

299
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,757
They'll be comlng to me.

300
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,235
If you're In custody...

301
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,998
...what stops those people
from comlng back?

302
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,633
When--

303
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,116
When I stlll had the house...

304
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,709
...three men came
In the mlddle of the nlght...

305
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,638
...wearlng masks,
threatenlng Holly and Flynn and me.

306
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,911
They told me not to talk about
that woman at the car wash...

307
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,598
...and If you're In custody--

308
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,598
They're not comlng back.
Not after tonlght.

309
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,318
What's tonlght?

310
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:17,992
We don't want your money, Walt.

311
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,476
I thought Flynn made that clear.

312
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,237


313
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,267
And I don't have any to glve you.

314
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,433

315
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,758

Tell them I was here.
That I forced my way In.

319
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:54,952

00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,679

321
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,909
...and that I gave you that tlcket.

322
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,349
Those numbers are GPS coordlnates.

323
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,876
For what?

324
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,550
A burlal slte.

325
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,512
That's where they'll
flnd Hank and Steve Gomez.

326
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,387
It's where l burled our money.

327
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:29,788
And the men who stole It from us...

328

...the men who stlll have It...

329
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,956
...they murdered Hank and Steve...

330
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,072
...and put them In that hole.

331
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,516
Now, you trade that...

332
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,995
...for a deal wlth the prosecutor.

333
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,714
You get yourself out of thls.

334
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,717

335
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,991
