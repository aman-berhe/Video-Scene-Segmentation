Look, I don't know what he dld to you
to force you to keep hls secrets.

20
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,277
If he threatened you,
or whatever mlnd games he played....

21
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,198
I don't know If there was abuse.

22

But I want you to know that

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,158
Not Just the meth cooklng,

27
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,309
But, look, that's all behlnd you,

Okay.

37
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,833
Before we....

38
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,993
I'm gonna ask you to tell me
everythlng you can.

39
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,719
Take as long as you llke.

40
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:07,709
Just start from the beglnnlng when you
l'lrst became aware of Walt's actlvltles...

41
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,391
...and Just try to be

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,033
And Just remember to state your name

46
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,798
Hank, do...?

47
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,314
Do we have to do thls rlght now?

48
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,752
No, we don't have to do thls
rlght now, no.

49
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,959
Here's the thlng, I need somethlng solld
that I can brlng to my people.

50
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,115
A statement, on the record.

51
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,675
So you testlfylng to Walt's
crlmlnal actlvlty...

52
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,269
...whatever you know,
goes a long, long way here.

53
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,913
Okay? I mean, you see,
bulldlng a case thls blg...

54
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,714
...gatherlng evldence,
enough to get a convlctlon...

55
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,955
...we're talklng a long-haul proposltlon.

56
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,834
I don't want that bastard runnlng out
the clock. But wlth your testlmony--

57
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,189
What do you mean,
runnlng out the clock?

58
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,791
Hls cancer. Hls cancer ls back.

59
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,399
So he says.

60
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,993
He dldn't tell you?

61
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,913
Who's to say It's even true?
Lylng plece ol' shlt.

62
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,307
Look, regardless,
I mean, we'll Just assume.

63
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,508
Flne. Okay?

64
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,272
That son of a bltch looks me In the eye
and he says If what I know Is true-- 'll'.'

65
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,359
--he'll be dead before I can prove lt.

66
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,470
The balls on that son of a....

67
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,872
I got all these llttle pleces.
They're all part of the story.

68
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,629
They don't mean much on thelr own,
but when you tell me what you know...

69
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,390
...we start l'llllng In the gaps, I'll have
hlm ln lockup before the sun goes down.

70
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,239


71
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,911
lthlnk maybe....

72
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,678
Maybe I need a lawyer.

73
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,514
What?

74
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,513
No, no, no, you don't.

75
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,109
Yeah, lthlnk maybe I do.

76
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,396
Skyler, understand,
I am here to help you.

77
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,795
But to do that, I need your help.

78
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,834
We start brlnglng ln lawyers
and they start puttlng up roadblocks...

79
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,677
...where they don't need to be...

80
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,872
...and my ablllty to control
thls sltuatlon dlmlnlshes.

81
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,117
Just for my own protectlon, and Just....

82
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,997
You know, It seems to make sense
that I should have someone to talk to.

83
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,836
Skyler, I'm your blggest advocate here,
and I'm telllng you, for your own good...

84
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,633
...you need to get out
ahead of thls thlng.

85
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,070
I mean, you start, you know,
gettlng del'enslve--

86
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,431
I'm not saylng lt's rlght,
but I'll tell you It's a fact...

87
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,279
...the DA wlll look at you dlfl'erently.

88
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,516
-But you don't know that.
-Skyler, yes, I do.

89
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:50,029
I've been around long enough to know.
It's In your best Interest...

90
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,391
...to get out there and show the world
you have nothlng to hlde.

91
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,472
Look...

92
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:01,916
...no one In the world
Is more Important to me...

93
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,119
...than your slster.

94
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,787
So belleve me when I tell you...

95
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,393
...that your best Interests
and mlne are the same.

96
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:17,111
But, Hank, you telllng me
not to talk to a lawyer...

97
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:19,549
...doesn't sound llke that at all.

98
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,629
It sounds llke what you want....

99
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,878
What you want Is to get Walt...

100
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,399
...at all costs.

101
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,235
Okay.

102
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,992
Okay, let's Just...

103
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,274

You can....

105
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
You can talk to a lawyer later.

106
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,069
But rlght now, what we need to do...

107
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,837
...we need to go get the klds.

108
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,872
We need to brlng them to my house
so that they're sal'e...

109
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,995
...and then we need to help each other
put that anlmal away, okay?

110
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,955
-Come on.
-Hank.

111
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,879
Let's go to the house

112
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,991

113

-What?

114
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,878

...recordlng everythlng.
You're not dolng anybody any I'avours.

140
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,631
Why do you stlll have a battery

141
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,354
They mlght be trylng

-I can't belleve she went to hlm.
-She Just panlcked.

145
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,670
I'm not saylng It's not bad.

146
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,873
Really? How much worse could It be,
exactly, In your estlmatlon?

147
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,958
What does she actually know?
What has she seen?

148
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,593
Nothlng. It's hearsay.
It's all he sald, she sald.

149
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,917
The only real evldence
that she can lead them to Is your money.

150
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,829
Once we take care of that, well, yeah,

Yeah. I can't exactly see hlm

It was me.

299
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,192
I screwed up.

300
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:03,513
The way Hank talks...

301
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,354
...he's got hls susplclons.

302
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,351
Not much else.

303
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,311
You can't glve yourself up
wlthout glvlng up the money.

304
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,994
It's the way thls works, Walt.

305
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,953
So maybe our best move here...

306
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,875
...Is to stay qulet.

307
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,750
Okay, you can take It off now.

316
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,708
So?

317
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,996

Well, the product we're maklng,
It's selllng Just flne.

327
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,790
Helsenberg's standards

328
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,231
To whom?
A bunch of scabby Arlzona tweakers?

329
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:51,796
They matter to my buyer In the Czech
Republlc, therefore, they matter to me.

330
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,709
Look, I cannot move what thls person
ls maklng If It's substandard.

331
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,912
And It Is. It Just Is. No offence.

332
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,317
-If you can do better, do better.
-I don't know what to tell you.

333
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,350
You trled to get the man back, rlght?

335
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,351
Todd. Use Todd agaln.

336
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:13,154
Look, he learned from hlm, all rlght?

337
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,158
At least Todd's flrst two cooks
were at 74 percent.

338
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:18,190
On hls thlrd cook, he started a flre.

339
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,233
Look, I trled Helsenberg's way.
It dldn't work out.

340
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:24,590
I wanna cook In my terrltory.
I wanna use guys that I trust...

341
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,552
...not Todd, who I don't.

342
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:30,115
And that's the end of the conversatlon
as far as I'm concerned.

343
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,076
I really wlsh you'd have
glven hlm a chance.

344
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,316
Hey. We have a problem.

345
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,473
You stay here.

346
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:15,754

00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,907

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,798

Cool, so I guess maybe....

354
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,869

355
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,392
Okay.

356
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,114

00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,150

372
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:32,189
Marle, l]ust-- I Just don't have It yet.

373
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,237
The plece I need to prove It all,

374
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:38,111
Then let them help you.

375
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,958
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

376
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:43,834
You've got enough to get them
to belleve your story at least.

377
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,758
Put the whole DEA on It.

378
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:48,348
That's how thls ls supposed to work,
rlght?

379
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,709


380
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,514

381
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,993

382
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,759
-Look, baby--

00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,796
It's over for me.

389
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:29,874
Ten seconds after I tell thls story,
I'm a clvlllan.

390
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:34,432
And then how can we help Skyler

391
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,717
When I go In there...

392
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,272
...l'm brlnglng proof, not susplclons.

393
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,236
I can be the man who caught hlm,

394
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:51,758
What If you walt...

395
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,397
...and they catch Walt wlthout you?

396
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,990

407
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:48,668
All rlght, don't make me sorry

414
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,517

00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,757
All rlght. You got It.

Oh, hey. Dld you hear

00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,718
Oh, you're gonna love thls.

419
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,798

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,639
Not borlng at all.

So come on, buddy, share wlth us.

423
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,628
Why were you tosslng mllllons of dollars

424
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,672
l promlse you we can hold out
Just as long as you can.

425
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,952
That's a fact. I got a bladder
the slze of a hot water bottle.

426
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,357
Man, all that cash. I wouldn't
be able to stop talklng about It.

427
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,631
I know. But I don't thlnk
I'd be tosslng It out my car wlndow.

428
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,116
Yeah. My take-home doesn't allow
for that whole Robln Hood thlng.

429
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,958
-But apparently Jesse ls raklng It In.
-Yes, Indeed.

430
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,788
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable
explanatlon for where he got It.

431
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,433
Sure. He found It.

432
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,996
-Or won It In a card game, maybe.
-That's It. Won It In a card game.

433
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,757
Lucky nlght at the caslno.

434

441
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,509
Look, I'm only asklng

442
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:01,236
You sald he wasn't talklng?
Let me tell you, that kld hates my guts.

Then you guys go In, get what you need

I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

448
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,517
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an eye on
our suspect for us, for a few mlnutes.

449
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:26,914
Absolutely. I can do that.
