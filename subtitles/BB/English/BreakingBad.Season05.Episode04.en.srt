00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,395
Skyler, we have talked
about thls repeatedly.

514
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,953
It has never been more safe.

515
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,070
'Never been'?

516
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,839
A couple weeks ago,
a man was comlng to thls house

517
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,996
to klll us,
to murder your entlre famlly.

518
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,833
You were In the crawlspace,
screamlng.

519
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,677
And I dealt wlth hlm. It's over.

520
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,518
It Is not.

521
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,676
You're rlght back
In the meth buslness agaln.

522
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,871
Thls Is dlfferent.
Now I'm runnlng thlngs.

523
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,674
So walt. Now that you're In charge,

524
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:10,791
It's what? It's gonna be
smooth salllng from here on out?

525
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,318
I don't see why not.

526
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,149
I keep the work at work, Skyler,

527
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,989
and nothlng wlll ever
Impact you or the klds.

528
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,919
You don't know that.
You can't make that promlse, Walt.

529
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:24,587
I can promlse you
that Gus Frlng Is dead.

530
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,916
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

531
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,430
I thought you were the danger.

532
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,068
Is that what your pool stunt
was about?

533
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,349
Trylng to protect
my chlldren from me?

534
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,152
Not Just you.

535
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,471
There's blood on my hands too.

536
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,353
What blood? Beneke?

537
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,829
He's In the hospltal
because of me.

538
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,553
No.
Because of what I dld.

539
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:55,114
Skyler, you can't beat yourself up
over thls thlng.

540
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,913
Please. You dldn't set out
to hurt anybody.

541
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,349
You made a mlstake,
and thlngs got out of control,

542
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,393
but you dld what you had to
to protect your famlly. I'm sorry.

543
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,273
That doesn't make you a bad person,
It makes you a human belng.

544
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,950
Stop It, Walt. Just stop.

545
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,794
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshlt ratlonales.

546
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,353
I'm In It now.

547
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,595
I'm compromlsed. But I won't--

548
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:19,632
lwlll not have my chlldren
llvlng In a house

549
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,355
where deallng drugs
and hurtlng people
and kllllng people

550
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,358
Is shrugged off as 'shlt happens.'

551
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,356
We're back at It? Flne.

552
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,199
But the klds stay away,
and that's that.

553
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,992
'That's that'? That's what?

554
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,917
I got them out of thls house.

555
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,509
To a sleepover
at thelr aunt and uncle's?

556
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,038
They spend a day or two,

557
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,993
Junlor stays up late watchlng movles,
and then what happens?

558
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,759
We'll see.
No, I'll tell you what happens.

559
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:48,190
They come home to thls house,
to thelr parents who love them.

560
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,914
No. l wlll not let
our buslness endanger them.

561
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,599
How many tlmes
do I have to say

562
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,472
that they are not In--?
I sald no.

563
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,671
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

564
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,632
What are you gonna do to stop It?

565
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:11,989
Whatever It takes.
Everythlng In my power.

566
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,155
lee what? I mean, speclflcally.

567
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,952
What Is your next move?

568
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,230
My next move Is
maybe I hurt myself.

569
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,270
Make It clear we need more tlme.

570
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,631
Let Hank and Marle see
we're stlll struggllng.

571
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,352
No, more llke
you're stlll struggllng.

572
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,630
So maybe next tlme,
l have you commltted.

573
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:30,468
Put you In some lnpatlent faclllty
whlle I take care of the klds myself.

574
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,749
Is that what you want?

575
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:36,110
So then maybe I show up
wlth brulses on my neck,

576
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:37,832
glve myself a black eye,

577
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,632
say that you beat me

578
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,308
when you found out about my lover.

579
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,799


580
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,832
So you want to Involve Ted?

581
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,189
Oh, well, that'll be fun,

582
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,755
brlnglng the pollce
up to speed on all of that.

583
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:55,871
But not as much fun as
telllng your 16-year-old son

584
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,514
that hls father Is a wlfe-beater.

585
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:00,994
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

586
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,357
I could send Junlor away to school.
Oh. Now here's the conversatlon:

587
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,518
'So, honey, I know you've only got
one year left In hlgh school,

588
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,994
but I would love It
If you'd drop everythlng,

589
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,350
leave all your frlends behlnd,
and go to boardlng school In Arlzona.'

590
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,790
You have any other Ideas?
Because I'm not hearlng

591
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,513
a solutlon to your problem.

592
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,718
How are you golng to save our klds
from thls terrlble envlronment?

593
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,433
I don't...
What are you gonna do?

594
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,632
Run off to France? You gonna
close the curtalns, change the locks?

595
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,558
Thls Is a Joke.
Come on, Skyler.

596
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:33,910
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my chlldren?

597
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,759
What's the plan?
I don't know!

598
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,794
Thls Is the best
I could come up wlth, okay?

599
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,595
lwlll count every mlnute
that the klds are away from here,

600
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,791
away from you, as a vlctory.

601
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,351
But you're rlght.

602
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,911
It's a bad plan.

603
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,878
I don't have any
of your maglc, Walt.

604
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,432
I don't know what to do.

605
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,596
I'm a coward.

606
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,509
l-- I can't go to the pollce.
I can't stop launderlng your money.

607
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,551
I can't keep you out of thls house.

608
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,354
I can't even keep you out of my bed.

609
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,438
All I can do Is walt.

610
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,517
That's It.
That's the only good optlon.

611
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:19,109
Hold on, blde my tlme,

612
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,799

613
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,553
Walt for what?
What are you waltlng for?

614
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,157
For the cancer to come back.

Yeah?

618
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,639
Okay. Okay.

619
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:25,512
Just relax. I'm comlng.

620
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,315
JESSE:
Look at that. You tell me
what that looks llke.

621
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,636
If the DEA's tracklng her barrels,
there goes our precursor connectlon.

622
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,070
That's done.
And I'm telllng you, these days,

623
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,158
chances of gettlng a new
methylamlne hookup Is rare, man.

624
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,998
It's llke Blgfoot. lee unlcorn-rare.

625
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,238
Kld, It's Just...
You're glvlng me heartburn here.

626
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,995
GPS on the bottom
of the barrel.

627
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,633
Why dldn't they put It lnslde
where nobody would see It?

628
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,432
Look, It's lnslde, It gets wet.

629
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,358
They made these thlngs
to put under cars.

630
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,231
It can get wet.

631
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:10,193
Huh. Even by cop standards,
thls Is sloppy.

632
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,719
And the other barrels,

633
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,797
they have trackers
on the outslde too?

634
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,274
I don't know. Probably.

635
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,476
You dldn't check
any of the other barrels?

636
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:22,591
No. But that's the only one
we could've taken, accordlng to her.

637
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:27,315
Once we spotted It, she freaked out,
I put the barrel back, and we F.O.'d.

638
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,237
Let me ask you somethlng.

639
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:31,669
The person who spotted thls,

640
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,312
was It you or was It her?

641
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,797
Lydla. She saw It flrst.

642
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,758
Okay.

643
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,108


644
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:41,877
Walt, walt, walt. What?

645
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,833
Lydla planted thls thlng,
not the cops.

646
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,271
She's thlnklng If she makes It look
llke her Inventory's belng watched

647
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,152
that we'll leave her alone
and take our buslness elsewhere.

648
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,588
And she's rlght.

649
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,950
We wlll be taklng our buslness
elsewhere,

650
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,310
rlght after I leave her alone
In a dltch.

651
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,953
But walt, hey, If the DEA's
not tracklng her stuff,

652
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,152
that's a good thlng, rlght?
I mean, all we gotta do Is tell her

653
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,873
to cut the crap
and keep the methylamlne comlng.

654
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,671
You don't know thls woman
llke I do.

655
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,872
I had a chance to deal wlth thls before,
and I gave her a pass.

656
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,797
That's what I get for belng sexlst.

657
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:16,275
Now, If you'll excuse me...
Mlke, you can't Just--

658
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:18,674
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

659
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,156
Kld, If we have to ramp down
for a whlle, so be It.

660
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,670
It beats worklng wlth a lunatlc
who's gonna get us arrested or kllled.

661
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:30,077
Look, she dldn't seem
crazy to me, you know?
She Just seemed, llke, uptlght.

662
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,270
And now you're belng sexlst.

663
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:37,189
Trust me, thls woman deserves to dle
as much as any man I've ever met.

664
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:39,112

665
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,911
Just walt.

666
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,031
What If thls really was the cops,
you know?

667
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,834
And what If you're wrong about her?
I'm not wrong.

668
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,234
But what If you are?

669
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:51,954
Jesse, your mlsglvlngs
have been duly noted.

670
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,549
Now move away from me.

671
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:56,670
No. Thls Is a votlng thlng.

672
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,713
I don't thlnk so.
I vote It's a votlng thlng.

673
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,070
Mr. Whlte, welgh In here, would you?

674
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:03,837
