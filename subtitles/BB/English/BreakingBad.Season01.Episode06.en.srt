1
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,798
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,391
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,352
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,232
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

5
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,357
As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

6
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:08,709
I don't wanna see them,
I don't wanna hear them.

7
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,515
I want no Interaction with them
whatsoever.

8
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:19,038
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

9
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,595
You got any issues with that?

10
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,751
Whatever, man.

11
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,076
No matter what happens...

12
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,238
...no more bloodshed.

13
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,713
No violence.

14
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,398
Walt?

15
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,875
-You all right?
-0h, yeah.

16
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,751
Yeah, I'm okay.

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,316
You know, honey, you--
You really don't have to....

18
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,676
Look, I like being here with you.

19
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,033
Yeah.

20
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,072
I'm only saying that,
you know, I'd be okay...

21
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,634
...that really, if you wanna go....

22
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:57,992
You know, actually, it would
make me feel a little better...

23
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,714
...knowing that you were there
when Walter Jr. gets home from school.

24
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,152
Okay.

25
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,069
All right.
So you'll call me when you're finished?

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,918
-0h, yeah.
-0kay.

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,797
Oh, and have you been
In touch with Elliot?

28
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,355
Because I haven't seen
a cheque from him.

29
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,390
Yes, l-- I got It.

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,592
-Really?
-It came, yeah. And In

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,358
Yeah, it did. It came last week...

32
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,551
...and I put It right Into
my credit union account.

33
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,672
So I'm taking care of it.

34
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,117
-Good.
-Yeah.

35
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,107
So we're good. We're good.

36
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,952
Could you not deposit this
until Monday?

37
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,757
Thank you.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,151
Call if the discomfort's too much,
otherwise we'll see you next week.

39
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,838
Yeah.

40
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,718
Chemical reactions invoive
change on two levels:

41
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,274
matter and energy.

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,277
When a reaction is gradual,
the change in energy is slight.

43
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,676
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

44
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:42,512
For example, when rust collects
on the underside of a car, right?

45
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:50,232
But if a reaction happens quickly...

46
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,955
...otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way...

47
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:58,949
...that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

48
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,799
Who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,116
Hint, hint. Right here.

50
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,432
Like, an explosion?

51
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,717
Yes, good. Explosions.

52
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,198
Explosions are the result
of chemical reactions...

53
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,789
...happening almost instantaneously.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,390
And the faster reactants,
|.e. explosives--

55
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,114
And fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that.

56
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,358
--the faster they undergo change...

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,393
...the more violent the explosion.

58
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,957


59
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,117
Okay, listen, why don't you
start reading on your own...

60
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,676
...from the top of chapter seven.

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,114
You okay?

62
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,395
I got It, Mr. White.

63
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,157
Don't worry.

64
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,475
You got kids to teach.

65
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,950
Thanks, Hugo.

66
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,908
He's starting to lose weight...

67
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:56,635
...which is tough, to see that.

68
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:02,631
I can already feel the difference
when I put my arms around him.

69
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,071
-Can I talk to--?
-Of course.

70
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,512
Walt.

71
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,794
When you don't let me in...

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,355
...when you don't tell me
what's going on....

73
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,789
I mean, it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,069


75
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,911
And recently, these afternoons...

76
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,429
...when you're coming home so late...

77
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,110
...and we're Just left wondering
where you are.

78
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,395
Yeah, Dad.

79
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,759
What's up with that?

80
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,997
Walt, is there anything else
you're holding back from your family?

81
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,230
Now's the time to share.

82
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,952
Well, I....

83
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,598
I like to be alone, I mean, at times.

84
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,872
And it's not about you, really.

85
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:13,829
It's Just that sometimes
It feels better...

86
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,556
...not to talk at all...

87
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,391
...about anything...

88
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,198
...to anyone.

89
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,156
Alone time can be helpful,
for some types.

90
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,036
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone...

91
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,711
...might make it easier for your family
to be more accepting...

92
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,548
...of whatever it is you do alone.

93
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,712
Well...

94
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,391
...I like to go on walks...

95
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,191
...a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work.

96
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,110
And I really enjoy the nature.

97
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:01,313
You know, the cacti...

98
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,676
...vegetation, that kind of thing.

99
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,835
It's really very therapeutic.

100
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,478
Yo, God, are you okay?

101
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,433
-Hey, you did that shit?
-l'm dizzy. No.

102
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,233
I'm just dizzy. I need air.

103
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,874
-God, lfeel like I'm burning up.
-S|t down, sit down.

104
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,150
I gotta take this off.

105
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,112
Sit down, get some air.

106
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,511
Oh, God.

107
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,679
Here.

108
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,471
-Better?
-Yeah, that's better.

109
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,996
When were you gonna tell me?

110
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,518
Tell you what?

111
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,631
Cancer.

112
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,795
You got It, right?

113
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,993
How did you know?

114
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,239
My aunt had one of those
dots on her...

115
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,069
...to target the radiation.
What, Is It In your lung?

116
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,073
I'm your partner, man,
you should've told me.

117
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,077
God, that's not cool, okay?
Not at all.

118
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,795
What stage are you?

119
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,439
Three-A.

120
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,436
Gone into your lymph nodes.

121
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,152
Your aunt...

122
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,831
...how bad was she
when they caught It?

123
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,998
Bad enough, she didn't last long.

124
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,756
-How long?
-Seven months.

125
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,513


126
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,277
I get It now.

127
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,789
That's why you're doing all this.

128
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,072
You want to make some cash
for your people before you check out.

129
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,156
-You got a problem with that?
-You tell me.

130
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:43,715
You're the one that looks like
he just crawled out of a microwave.

131
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,275
You gonna be able to
finish the batch?

132
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,549
Yes.

133
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,429
All right.

134
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,998


135
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,752
You do It.

136
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,797
Me?

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,479
Yeah.

138
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,751
What happened to your mad skills?

139
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,791
Go on. Here.

140
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,512
You do It.

141
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,517
You can do It.

142
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:34,312
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

143
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:43,717
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

144
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,517
My aunt saId It helped
with the hair loss.

145
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,632
What's this, Christmas?

146
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,156
This that one we found way out
in the boonies at the cook site?

147
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,469
-Holy shit.
-What?

148
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,797
Lab says they pulled up and imprint
of some writing on the inside...

149
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,673
-...Magic Marker or something.
-Yeah? What's it say?

150
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,156
'Property of
J.P. Wlnn Chemistry Lab.'

151
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,634
That's Walt's school.

152
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,150
We were supposed to start at 3.

153
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:09,669
Hey, I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

154
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,873
Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it.

155
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,837
-How much Is this?
-Twenty-slx bIg ones.

156
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:28,111
Is that all?
Twenty-slx—thousand dollars?

157
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,074
No, that's 2600,
and your share Is 13...

158
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,478
...minus 25 bucks for that phone.

159
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,592
-How much meth dId you sell?
-Nearly an ounce.

160
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,748
Last time I checked...

161
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:47,429
...there were 16 ounces to a pound.
What did you do with the rest, smoke it?

162
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,676
Yo, I've been out all night
slinging crystal.

163
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,792
You think it's cake moving
a pound of meth one teenth at a time?

164
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,911
Why are you selling It
In small quantities?

165
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,588
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

166
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,631
To who?
What do I look like, Scarface?

167
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,037
This Is unacceptable.
I am breaking the law here.

168
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,390
This return is too little for the risk.

169
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,511
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound.

170
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,358
You may know a lot
about chemistry...

171
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,313
...but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

172
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,511
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

173
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,551
Oh, my....

174
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,389
Come on, you've gotta be more
imaginative, you know, just--

175
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,908
Just think outside the box here.

176
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:28,236
We have to move our product in bulk,
wholesale.

177
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,274
Now, how do we do that?

178
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,477
-What do you mean, to a distributor?
-Yes. Yes, that's what we need.

179
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:43,077
Yeah, I mean, I used to,
until you killed him.

180
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,233
So who took Krazy-8's place?

181
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,874
Some guy named Tuco.

182
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,399
Badass, from what I hear.

183
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,828
Tuco, okay.
So then just go talk to Tuco.

184
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,837
Right. Like, "Hello, sir.
Hey, I know you don't know me...

185
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,156
...would you be interested in a
felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

186
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,193
Well, yes, but maybe with
a little more salesmanship, perhaps?

187
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,276
You just don't get It, man.
This guy's OG.

188
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,916
-What-- What does that mean?
-Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.

189
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,077
He's not gonna do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

190
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,318
You don't understand
the way It works.

191
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,477
You can't just bum-rush
some high-level Ice man...

192
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,238
...and start cutting deals.

193
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,910
Okay? lt's risky. You need an intro,
you need someone to vouch.

194
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,950
Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?

195
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,878
Emilio, and that's only because
I knew him from third grade.

196
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,435
-And we can't talk to Emilio, because--
-All right, all right, all right.

197
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,714
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, It's too risky. Okay?

198
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,479
I mean, we're making money.
Why can't you be satisfied...

199
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,670
-...wlth the way It Is?
-0h, come on! Jesus!

200
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:59,347
Just grow some fucking balls!

201
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:43,470
-Walt tlll Monday again?
-Yes, please. Thank you.

202
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,431
Oh, God.

203
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,112
Mr. White.

204
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,550
Thank you, Hugo.

205
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,958
-Knock, knock.
-0h, hey.

206
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,315
-How you feeling, Walt?
-Good. Yeah.

207
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,069
Are you up for having a visitor?

208
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,597
-Hey, buddy.
-Hank.

209
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,596
Well, let me know
If you need anything.

210
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,108
lwill. Thank you, Carmen.

211
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,158


212
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,397
Chick's got an ass like an onion,
makes me wanna cry.

213
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,950
So, what-- What are you doing here?

214
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,152
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you, work-related.

215
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,112
You feeling okay?
I can come back later.

216
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,153
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

217
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,837
What do you mean,
'work-related,‘ though?

218
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,272
Do you recognise that?

219
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,110


220
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,158
Well, that was used to cook meth.

221
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,228
Found it out on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

222
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,035
Old label on the inside used to say:

223
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,114
-'J.P. Wlnn Chemistry Lab.'
-Really?

224
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,035
I don't understand
how that came from here.

225
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,070
l was hoping
you could help me with that.

226
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,875
We found it near an abandoned car
that belonged to one of our snitches.

227
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,748
A snitch?

228
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,837
Yeah, one of our
confidential lnformants.

229
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,509
Went missing a while back.

230
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:09,791
No body yet,
but we're pretty sure, you know:

231
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:14,629
Probably chopped up into little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

232
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,477
Anyway, you--

233
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,398
Any respirators like that
go missing lately?

234
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,228


235
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,710
No, I mean, not that I know of.

236
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,230
-l'll need to look at that Inventory.
-Sure.

237
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,795
Sure.
I've got a list hanging on the wall.

238
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,149
Do you mind If I take a look
at your storeroom?

239
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,112
Not at all. No.

240
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,038
Be my guest.

241
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,717
All right, so who's got keys?

242
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,274
The science faculty,
the staff, Carmen...

243
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,359
...the vIce-prlnclpal has the master,
and me.

244
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,391
How about students?

245
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,393
No, no. No students have keys.

246
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,477
Shit, I should hope not.
My question Is...

247
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,318
...do any of the little pissants
know where you keep them?

248
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,918
ldon't-- I don't think so, no.

249
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,077
I mean, besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so--

250
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,634
Walt, look,
I know they're your students...

251
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,149
...but do not underestimate them.
BIg mistake.

252
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,238
-Are there any other respirators?
-No.

253
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:14,158
Because I'm counting slx,
Inventory says eight.

254
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,234
-Glassware looking a little sparse.
-Is It?

255
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,151
Yeah. You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks, at least.

256
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,873
Oh, yeah.

257
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,511
A five-thousand mlllllltre
round-bottom.

258
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,837
Meth heads love to brew in this baby.

259
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,394
-You gonna answer that?
-0h, no, It's just-- No, I don't--

260
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,318
Maybe It's Skyler
and she's In trouble.

261
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,308
Shit, don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it. Come on, I got stuff to do.

262
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,837
-Jeez.
-0kay.

263
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,191
-Hello?
-Yo, what's up, Mr. W?

264
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,435


265
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,834
-Bad time to talk?
-Absolutely.

266
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,518
All right, so just listen.

267
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:01,597
So you know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

268
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,950
Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete,
was in the same cell block with him...

269
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,353
...over at Los Lunas.

270
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,111
So we got our in. We're hauling
a pound to the dude right now.

271
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,349
Okay, then. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much for calling.

272
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,030
My doctor is very solicitous.

273
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:23,595
Hey, look, buddy. The last thing
I wanna do is get you in hot water.

274
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,518
But some meth-monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

275
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,473
You gotta keep better watch
over your turf.

276
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,907


277
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,997
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

278
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,190
Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

279
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,516
So you're sure
you're tight with this guy?

280
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,393
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

281
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,917
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete.

282
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:21,875
Maybe this Isn't such a good Idea, yo.
Come on.

283
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,632
Yeah, man, that's what's happening.

284
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,147
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

285
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,795
No need, man. Me and Tuco go back.

286
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:11,915
Tuco, what's happening, my brother?

287
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,319
Sick crib, yo. You've been keeping
it real since you been sprung.

288
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,317
-What's It been, like, a year?
-Thls your boy?

289
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:27,238
Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass
l was telling you about.

290
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,351
Hey, man, yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

291
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,949
Break out the ice.

292
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:51,714
-Take a bump.
-No worries, man, I'm no cop.

293
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,637
I said, hlt It.

294
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,038
All right.

295
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,835
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

296
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,671
-Where'd you get It?
-I cooked It.

297
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:23,628
Bullshit.

298
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,193
Who you working for?

299
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,435
No one, man. I mean, I have a partner
that I cook with, but that's it.

300
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,713
All right.

301
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,759
We got a deal.

302
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,756
See, I told you Tuco
would hook you up.

303
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,679
Cool. I haven't said how much.

304
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,077
All right. How much?

305
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,997
Thirty-five large for the pound.

306
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,637
Well, I mean, you're a little light, ese.

307
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:12,149
It's all right, don't sweat It.
It's all good.

308
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,191
It's good. Go on, get out of here.

309
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,034
-What about the money?
-You'll get It.

310
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,831
This is a consignment operation.

311
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,557
You want me to flow It
thirty-five G's?

312
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,873
You don't trust me?

313
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,956
Hey, no, no, hey. It's not that, man.

314
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,152
It's just, you know,
I don't do business that way.

315
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,920
Tough shit, the deal is done.

316
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,034
You said this was cool, okay?
Money for meth, cash up front.

317
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:44,195
Don't front, dude, Tuco's good for it.

318
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,238
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me.

319
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,078
Come on.

320
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,076
Oh, come on.

321
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,674
All right. You brought me
some really clean crystal.

322
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,635
You really want your money up front?

323
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,468
Up front.

324
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,958
Nobody moves crystal
in the South Valley but me, bitch.

325
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,788
Morning, Hugo.

326
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:40,672
You don't mind If I call you Hugo,
Hugo?

327
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,789
We've never had a problem
with Hugo, ever.

328
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:48,591
Is that Uncle Hank?

329
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,952
Right, what do you got there?
All right. Book him.

330
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,638
Uncle Hank's
arresting Mr. Archllleya.

331
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,118
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

332
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,198
I got two words for you:
background check. How about that?

333
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,477
Yo, yo, yo.
1-4-8, 3-to-the-3, to-the-G, to-the-9.

334
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,433
Representing the .450.
What up, blatch?

335
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:13,391
Leave it at the tone.

336
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,070
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

337
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,554
-Hey, Walt?
-Yeah?

338
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,787
-Hank's about to deal.
-0kay, I'll be right there.

339
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,920
All right,
let's see what the turn brings us.

340
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,277
You're looking good, Wait.
Your colour's better.

341
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,151
Yeah? Thanks.

342
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,033
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

343
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:45,754
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but--

344
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:48,427
Well, actually,
I just talked to Carmen this morning...

345
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,517
...and they're getting a substitute
for a few weeks.

346
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,029
-Good.
-I just didn't have a chance to tell you.

347
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:56,673
-Sorry.
-Your bet, tough guy.

348
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,471
Check.

349
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,268
Yeah, check.

350
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,596
Cheque's in the mail.

351
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,994
-Ten mllllon.
-That's 25 million, blue's 1o.

352
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,872
Well, then, 25 million,
because that's how I roll.

353
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,833
Hey, Uncle Hank...

354
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,827
...I heard you arrested
Mr. Archilleya the other day.

355
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,075
He's a pretty cool guy.

356
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,832
Well, turns out he has a record.
Yeah, a couple of possession beefs.

357
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,430
We figured he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

358
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:29,678
I mean, you know,
he had a key, fit the profile.

359
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:32,996
And when we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt.

360
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:36,316
Which goes to prove
old huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.

361
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,114
-lt's to you, Walt.
-Yeah, I'll call.

362
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,356
You know,
I can't believe the school system...

363
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,311
...didn't know about this guy's record.

364
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,954
I mean, that's scary.
How could something like that...

365
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,435
-...just slip through the cracks?
-I don't know.

366
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,509
I mean, for what it's worth,
Hugo just doesn't strike me as a thief.

367
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,951
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,
but you wouldn't know a criminal...

368
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,753
...If he was close enough
to check you for a hernia.

369
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,116
That said, we got a search warrant,
and we tore old Hugo's house apart.

370
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,833
Turns out
he's a major-league pothead.

371
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:12,348
But he didn't raid your chemistry set.

372
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,949
You hiding something?

373
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:23,870
I'm in. And the river card.

374
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,311
Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.

375
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,191
I'm out.

376
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,110
When old holes-in-her-purse bails,
you know you're in deep.

377
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,710
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

378
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,433
What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?

379
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,077
Well, I mean, he's gonna
lose his job, like he should.

380
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:51,908
Probably spend a couple months in
county, because it's not his first rap.

381
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,071
I'm waiting.

382
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,475
You gonna man up
or are you gonna puss out?

383
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,237


384
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,279
Sorry.

385
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,718


386
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:17,517
Dude.
You bad, bad, bad, horrible llar.

387
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,910
What are you smoking there, huh?

388
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

389
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,913
Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. l fold.

390
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,796
-Talk about anti-climactic.
-Hey.

391
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:38,149
Your cards couldn't have been
that bad, come on.

392
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,396
Oh, my God. You threw away an ace?

393
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,239
-What are you doing?
-And a cowboy for....

394
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,394
A handful of nothing.

395
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,152
Yeah, what up?

396
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,671
Who Is this?
I was dlalllng Jesse Plnkman.

397
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,519
Hey, man, he's out.

398
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,195
Well, where is he, then?

399
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,238
You the guy?

400
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,036
Yeah, I'm the guy.

401
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,677
How Is he?

402
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,153
Got some busted ribs, and like that.

403
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,637
Got messed up pretty good.

404
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,035
l was all, like,
'Damn, Tuco, chlll, ese."

405
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,480
I don't know what got Into him.
Seriously.

406
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,349
He's out, man. Way out.

407
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,515
They got him doped up big time.

408
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,593
So you're the cook, huh?

409
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,950
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

410
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:11,628
Tell me about this Tuco.

411
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,594
Tell me everything about him.

412
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,875
Morning.

413
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:59,670
Could you pass the butter, please?

414
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,712


415
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,913
Hey, cue ball. Need directions?

416
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,915
You Tuco?

417
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,477
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

418
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,308
What's your name?

419
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,030
Heisenberg.

420
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,675
Heisenberg. Okay.

421
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,512
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

422
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,274
I don't imagine I'll be here very long.

423
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,037
No?

424
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,118
All right.

425
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,635
Be that way.

426
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:49,952
It's your meeting.

427
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,197
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

428
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,997
Fifty thousand dollars.

429
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:01,747
Oh, man.
Fifty G's? How you figure that?

430
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,349
Thirty-five
for the pound of meth you stole...

431
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,233
...and another fifteen
for my partner's pain and suffering.

432
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,558
Partner.

433
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:24,508
Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch.

434
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,712
So you must be Daddy.

435
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,991
Let me get this straight.

436
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,356
I steal your dope...

437
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:45,076
...I beat the piss
out of your mule boy...

438
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,159
...and then you walk in here
and you bring me more meth?

439
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,672
That's a brilliant plan, ese.

440
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,313
Brllllant.

441
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,319
You got one part of that wrong.

442
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,680
This Is not meth.

443
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,397
Are you fucking nuts?

444
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,919
You wanna find out?

445
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,588
No, no, Gonzo, calma.

446
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,077
You got balls, I'll give you that.

447
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:51,715
All right, all right.
I'll give you your money.

448
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,912
That crystal
that your partner brought me...

449
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,954
...It sold faster than ten-dollar ass
In TJ.

450
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,234
Let's say you bring me
another pound next week.

451
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,874
Money up front.

452
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,953
All right.

453
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:21,027
Money up front.

454
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,553
Sometimes you gotta rob
to keep your riches.

455
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,271
Just as long as we got
an understanding.

456
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:40,037
One pound is not gonna cut it.
You have to take two.

457
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:47,348
Oh, really?

458
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,279
Hey, what is that shit?

459
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,794
Fulminated mercury...

460
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:59,113
...and a little tweak of chemistry.
