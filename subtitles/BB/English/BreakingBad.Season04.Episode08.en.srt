1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,998
-Are m done?
-L|:tan, l--

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,113
This attack on my brother-in-Iaw,
I don't know what it means.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,992
Plea“.

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:15,274
I fear for my famlly.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,875
I'm sure they'll be fine.

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,715
I'm told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,831
lt's doubtful he'll live.

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,557
Now, thank me and shake my hand.

9
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:33,791
-Thank you. Thank you again.
-You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,716
Guys, guys, hurry up.

11
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:39,752
-Can we go now?
-Upsta|rs, come on.

12
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,351
What's happening?

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,273
Eight forty-three.

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,516
Time of death, 20:43.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,715
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,156
One of the gunmen died
at the scene.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,432
The second succumbed to his wounds
earlier this evening.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,198
Agents with the DEA and FBI...

19
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:08,153
...in conjunction with APD are working
with Mexican law enforcement...

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,068
...in an attempt to identify
the deceased suspects. Both--

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,315
I can give you the highlights.

22
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:34,076
Your nephews grew impatient.

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,716
They continued to press me
for my permission to kill Walter White.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,357
When I wouldn't give it, they settled
instead for DEA Agent Schrader.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,311
But a phone call was placed...

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,080
...to Agent Schrader
moments before the attack.

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,714
Thus giving him the upper hand.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,753
Marco was shot In the face
and died Instantly.

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,872
Leonel lingered for several hours.

30
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,752
The warning call to the DEA agent...

31
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:04,472
...Juan Bolsa
may have some Insight...

32
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,670
...Into who placed It.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,996
Yesterday,
federaIes ralded hls haclenda.

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,111
And In the confusion,
Juan was shot dead.

35
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,834
An accident, perhaps.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,432
A mistake made by his own men.

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,996
Though we may never know.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,712
At any rate,
I thought you should hear It from me.

39
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,998
This Is what comes
of blood for blood, Hector.

40
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,875
So is this the loud one?

41
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,389
What?

42
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,590
I can never remember.

43
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,428
Is this the loud machine
with the magnets?

44
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,153
No. This is the PETICT scan.

45
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,556
Positron emission tomography.

46
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:54,957
They've paired that
with computed x-ray tomography.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,108
Quiet. No magnets.

48
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,031
Right, okay.

49
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,433
Yeah, thanks.

50
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,150
I'm still pretty new at this.

51
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,715
One minute,
I'm starting a new business...

52
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,989
...my wife and l
are thinking about kids.

53
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,667
Walk Into a doctor's office
and suddenly....

54
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,030
-I mean, life as I know lt--
-Excuse me.

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,513
Yes. I'm waiting
to hear a progress report...

56
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,235
...on the thing we discussed,
so call me.

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,991
Anyway, so for me,
that's been the biggest wake-up call.

58
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,997
Letting go, giving up control.

59
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,033
You know, it's like they say,
"Man plans and God laughs."

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,793
That is such bullshit.

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,474
Excuse me?

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,069
Never give up control.

63
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,877
Live life on your own terms.

64
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,994
Yeah, no,
I get what you're saying...

65
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,235
...but cancer is cancer, so....

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,351
To hell with your cancer.

67
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,472
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,389
From the start, it's a death sentence.
That's what they keep telling me.

69
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,191
Well, guess what?

70
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,550
Every life comes
with a death sentence.

71
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,912
So every few months,
I come in here for my regular scan...

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,795
...knowlng full well
that one of these times--

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,275
Hell, maybe even today.

74
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,994
--l'm gonna hear some bad news.

75
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,070
But until then...

76
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,277
...who's In charge?

77
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,078


78
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,989
That's howl live my life.

79
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,758
This residue here is why we descale
with cool water...

80
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,349
...from the walk-In
and not water from the tap.

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,312
Do It again, please.

82
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:06,316
Pollos Hermanos, where something
delicious is always cooking.

83
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,556
Yes, detectlve.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,149
Yeah.

85
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,875
-Gustavo, thanks for coming.
-Pleasure.

86
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,468
-How's Kathl?
-Much better, thank you.

87
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,239
-And you know Hank Schrader?
-Yes, Indeed.

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,749
-And steve Gomez?
-How was your meal?

89
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,032
Agent Schrader and I had a chance
to catch up at one of my restaurants.

90
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,436
l'd eat there every day
but I wouldn't fit through the door.

91
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,557
-Well, should we get started?
-Yeah.

92
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,430
-l'd like to record this conversation.
-0f course.

93
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,594
The DEA is working on an investigation
which may overlap with my own...

94
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,437
...so I've asked them to sit in.

95
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,109
Gus, we all appreciate your coming
in here to talk to us...

96
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,072
...but you have the right
to have an attorney present.

97
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,352
Oh, well, I can't see
how that would be necessary.

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,471
But then,
I have no Idea why I'm here.

99
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,192
So you wish to continue?

100
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,915
Please. I'm very anxious
to find out what this is all about.

101
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:32,595
Sir, your fingerprints were found
at a crime scene.

102
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,917
Really? That's surprising.

103
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,634
A drug-related homicide.

104
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,640
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,232
So you knew the victim?

106
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,196
Fifteen years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

107
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,960
I named It
after Maxlmlno Arclnlega...

108
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,195
...a dear friend of mine
who dIed young.

109
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,829
Gale was a recipient
of this scholarship.

110
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,998
He was perhaps one of three dozen.

111
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,838


112
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,358
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in....

113
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,233
-1999.
-That sounds right.

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,238
And you kept in contact with him
over all this time?

115
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,797
Oh, no. I hadn't seen Gale for years
until I ran into him a few weeks ago.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,878
-Ran Into him where?
-At the restaurant.

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,672
Well, 'ran Into' Isn't quite accurate,
as I assumed...

118
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,668
...he came by to re-establish contact
with me. We caught up briefly.

119
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,428
He invited me to dinner
the following night and I accepted.

120
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,759
It was perhaps a week later
when I read about him in the paper.

121
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,632
-Drug related, you said?
-lt's a good posslblllty.

122
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,989
The paper made no mention of that.

123
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,760
I assumed
that It was a random crlme.

124
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,952
So after years with no contact,
he shows up in your restaurant...

125
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,357
-...and Invites you to dinner?
-He wanted money.

126
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,358
-Gale Boetticher asked for money?
-He didn't say that.

127
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:13,270
He spoke in terms
of a vague investment opportunity.

128
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:17,313
But it was my suspicion, yes,
as to why he invited me into his home.

129
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,593
He was a very, very talented chemist,
but for reasons I never understood...

130
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,711
...he was more Interested
In taklng shortcuts...

131
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,469
...than what would or could have been
a very promising career.

132
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,715
Personal shortcomings
notwithstanding...

133
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,989
...he was a warm, gentle person...

134
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,475
...and I thought a lot of him.

135
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:42,398
At any rate,
I declined his business offer...

136
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,796
...and after
what was a very pleasant meal, left.

137
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:48,077
Can you tell us where you were...

138
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,716
...on the night of Wednesday the 23rd
at around 8 pm?

139
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,391
-Not an accusation, just a question.
-No, I understand. Let's see.

140
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,037
Twenty-third.

141
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,914
l was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

142
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,680
l was there from 7 to about 10.

143
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,710
Anyone else?

144
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,279
Sorry, yeah. Just one other thing.

145
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,228
ls Gustavo Fring your real name?

146
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,071
Is It my real name?

147
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,794
I know you're a Chilean national...

148
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:32,036
...but there are no records of you
ever lIvIng there.

149
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,152
Really?

150
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:38,950
I mean, records show that you
immigrated to Mexico in 1986...

151
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,357
...and years later, you were granted
an entry visa to the United States.

152
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,351
But there's no record of Gustavo Fring
ever having existed in Chile...

153
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:52,437
...which I find, I don't know, strange.

154
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,910
Well, no, really, It Isn't.

155
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,034
Plnochet's government
was guilty of many slns.

156
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,469
First and foremost
were human rights abuses.

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,390
But it was also notoriously unreliable
at keeping records.

158
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,437
I'm sure If you keep dlgglng,
you'll find me.

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,674
Okay, lthlnk that's It, Gus.
Thank you.

160
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,314
I hope that l was of some small help.

161
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,909
-You were, absolutely. Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

162
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,678
Good to see you again. Oh, no.

163
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,235
-No, please, please. Don't get up.
-Thanks.

164
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,832
Gentlemen.

165
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,476
So are we buylng?

166
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,874
This thing with his name?
What are you thinking?

167
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,038
Sure, the record-keeping
in South America's hit or miss.

168
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,595
I mean, we run Into that all the time,
right?

169
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,348
But we usually find something.
Before '86 this guy's a ghost.

170
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,393
lf State Department wasn't satisfied,
they wouldn't have naturalised him.

171
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:13,909
Well, maybe,
but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.

172
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,271
State just wasn't as tough
on background checks pre-9I11.

173
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:20,551
I don't know what this has to do
with the case at hand.

174
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,355
l was curious when his print showed up
at Boetticher's apartment.

175
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,516
For me, the scholarship explains it.

176
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,869
I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.

177
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,878
This man has been a longtime friend
of DEA.

178
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,790
But that being said,
I thought his story was credible.

179
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,634
Well, I agree.
lthlnk It was a good story.

180
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,909
Still, why are we hearing it now?

181
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,075
What do you mean?

182
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,716
Well, like you said, he's a-- This man
is a big law enforcement booster.

183
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,548
He's reading the newspaper and sees
that someone he had dinner with...

184
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,228
...someone he thought a lot of
was murdered.

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,113
He reads this
and he doesn't make a phone call?

186
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,518
Dldn't call you
or one of his other cop friends...

187
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:05,473
...to share his connection with the case
or ask about the investigation?

188
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,638
We can't predlcate
a criminal Investigation...

189
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,875
...on a person
not making phone calls.

190
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,198
What do you think, Tim?

191
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,074
Well, I wanna follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi...

192
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,156
...but my overall impression?

193
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,475
I believed him.

194
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,676
Nice touch. Birdbath.

195
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,479
-Hey, tlger, how's It hanging?
-Good.

196
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,515
What's the damage?

197
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,599
Twelve hundred a month.
I did a lot of research.

198
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,269
-That's a pretty good deal.
-You kidding me? That's a great deal.

199
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,277
Speaking of which...

200
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,591
...that's for the week.

201
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,429
Plus there's a little extra in there
for any move-related incidentals.

202
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,629
Thank you.

203
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,077
-Hey, champ, how's the new school?
-Good.

204
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,110
I loved school when l was your age.

205
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,789
Seesaws, story time,
chaslng girls with sticks.

206
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,677
It wasn't until the fifth grade
that I found out she liked me too...

207
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,629
...but by then her family had moved
to Scottsdale, so....

208
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,075
-Carpe dlem, okay?
-0kay.

209
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,712
All right. Good boy.

210
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,071
So you'll thank Jesse again
from both of us?

211
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,553
You got It.

212
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,231
-So Is he-- How's he doing?
-Jesse?

213
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:55,115
He's good. He's busy.

214
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,513
How Is It?

215
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:09,349
Space, lots of light. It's--
Little garden out back. It's nice.

216
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,630
And Brock? How's he doing?

217
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,072
Hey, look, I don't mind
dropping cheques off every week...

218
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,632
...like Ed McMahon...

219
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,114
...but If you wanna know
how they're doing...

220
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,959
...why don't you go see for yourself?

221
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,079
I'll catch you later.

222
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,908
-Hey, you gonna need a ride home?
-No.

223
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,714
Great.

224
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,393
Anyway,
I'm proud for not losing my cool.

225
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,318
Plus, It shows our crew
that I will support them...

226
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,271
...if a customer's being rude.

227
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:33,755
You're really taking to this whole
be-your-own-boss thing.

228
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:37,276
Yeah. I guess I am.

229
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,432
Actually...

230
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,476
...l'm thinking about making the move
up to management.

231
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,476
Jesus. Corporate America, look out.

232
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
Excuse me,
I would be a vast Improvement.

233
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,194
No one in Kleinman's entire front office
knows about giving an x-ray...

234
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,957
...which Is just....

235
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,954
Hey, Dad, whatever happened
with your scan?

236
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,150
Did you get the results back?

237
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,351
Yeah, I did...

238
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,629
...and I'm still in remission.

239
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,152
So you're all gonna have to be stuck
with me for a while longer.

240
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,349
Cheers, buddy.

241
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,239
What about you, Hank?
How you feeling these days?

242
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,351
You know, getting there.

243
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,871
The other day, he had a big powwow
with all the DEA muckety-mucks.

244
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,432
What was that about?

245
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,552
Nothing. Just a dead-end.

246
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:30,397
He won't tell me, either.

247
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,591
Apparently, it's all very hush-hush.

248
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,633
Hey, Walt, do me a favour?

249
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,956
Marie's working tomorrow
and there's a gem and mineral show...

250
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:45,437
...opening at the fairgrounds.
I wondered if you could give me a lift?

251
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,355
Yeah. Sure.

252
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,074
I had a collection of my own
In high school.

253
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,715
I mean, nothing fancy.
Just entry-level beryls and garnets...

254
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,229
...one passable black tourmaline.

255
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:59,031
-Turn right here.
-0kay.

256
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:04,916
But I did have one piece of morganite
that was very special.

257
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,359
lt'd been heat-treated,
so it had that classic cast to it.

258
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:13,108
That rose, almost salmon hue,
you know?

259
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,788
Hey, Walt,
there's no rock show, okay?

260
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,988
I just said that so Marie wouldn't freak.
Here. Take a right here.

261
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,910
Freak about what?

262
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,357
Hank, where are we going?

263
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,070
Are you hungry?

264
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,590
We're not here for the chicken.

265
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,238
Kill the engine.

266
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:47,355
All right.

267
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:50,393
You ready
for your mind to be blown?

268
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,518
Sure.

269
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,429
Gustavo Fring, remember him?

270
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,956
He came to the hospital
after the shooting. Put up the reward?

271
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,391
He sponsors the DEA Fun Run
every year. You've met him?

272
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,549
Yeah, the Fun Run guy. Yeah.
That guy, yeah. What about him?

273
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,037
Well, I suspect-- I can't prove it,
mind you, but I suspect...

274
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,110
...the man's a drug dealer.

275
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,034
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

276
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,356
I mean, honest to God,
I really belIeve...

277
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,030
...that this guy may be one
of the biggest movers in the southwest.

278
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,513
Remember Gale Boetticher?

279
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,109
-That sad sack from the karaoke tape?
-Yeah.

280
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,074
And you said that he didn't strike you
as being the boss-man type?

281
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,190
That there was a bigger guy
out there.

282
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,678
-Hank, that was just speculation.
-Doesn't matter. It made me keep at it.

283
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,676
And guess what I find?

284
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:50,236
Chicken Man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

285
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,194
-So we bring him In--
-You think that Gustavo Frlng...

286
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:55,832
...killed Gale Boetticher?

287
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,188
Probably not.

288
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,392
These guys usually get a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

289
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,353
But his fingerprints being there
was enough to bring him in. So l--

290
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,477
So you brought him in to the police?

291
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,271
Right. He sits down to talk with us,
the problem is that--

292
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,391
What dId you ask him?
What dId he say?

293
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,830
Walt,
will you let me finish my story here?

294
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,794
Sorry, I'm just
Interested, you know?

295
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:22,754
All right. Whatever. So we bring him in
and he proceeds to kick our asses.

296
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,793
Okay? He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints.

297
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:29,628
He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.
He's got reasons for everything.

298
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,037
This guy
Is Terms of Endearment convlnclng.

299
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,036
So he's not guilty?

300
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:38,117
Yeah. As far as DEA
and APD are concerned, he's not.

301
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,198
Officially, Fring's not a suspect.

302
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,278
But I'm telling you...

303
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,956
...somethlng deep down says
he's my guy.

304
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,197
Just gotta prove It.

305
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,155
Hank, why are you telling me this?

306
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,991
I need a favour.

307
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,274
What favour?

308
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:05,756
You see that Volvo station waggon
over there?

309
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,159
The guy drives a 10-year-old Volvo.
It's brIllIant.

310
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,312
Anyway, llsten...

311
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,712
...what I need for you to do...

312
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,871
...stlck this on It.

313
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,591
GPS tracker.

314
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,997
Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around
on her but she wants to be sure?

315
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,317
Stick this on the car--
This part here, It's a magnet.

316
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,077
--and see where he goes.

317
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,349
Cool, huh?

318
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,153
Two eighty-nine from SkyMall.

319
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,359
It's not llve-vlew,
so we gotta come back later...

320
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,154
...and take It off
and stick It In the computer.

321
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,193
Still, a pretty amazing time
we're lIvIng In.

322
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,674
Hank, isn't that illegal?

323
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:50,792
I mean, isn't there some sort
of unlawful search and something--

324
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:56,471
lt's known as extralegal.
But trust me, it's our little secret.

325
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,108
Look, It's easy, okay?
Here's what you do.

326
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,516
You untie your shoelace
and you head toward the restaurant.

327
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,278
You're walking past the car...

328
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,233
...look down and, "Hey, darn,
my shoe's untied." Okay?

329
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,432
Now, when you bend down
to tie your shoe...

330
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:14,630
...you stick this into the wheel well.

331
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,231
-Then you go inside and I don't know--
-Hank, I don't feel good about this.

332
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,591
I know that this kind of thing
is outside your comfort zone--

333
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,109
No, I mean it. This is a mistake.

334
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,194
Walt,
I need you to help me out here, okay?

335
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,038
This is really important to me.

336
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:33,390
Are you gonna make me beg?
Come on. Just stick it in there.

337
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,548
Yeah.

338
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:44,150
Just act normal.

339
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,559
May I help you?

340
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:31,467


341
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,194
Slr, may I help you?

342
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:41,268
I didn't do it. See?

343
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,914
-I didn't do It.
-Do It.

344
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,912
Do It.

345
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,269
May I help you with your order?

346
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,678
What the hell is he...?

347
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:22,112
Just made sure it was secure.

348
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,835
Hey, where's my soda?

349
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:29,749
Just kidding. Let's go. Let's go.

350
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,432
Yes, that one.

351
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,269
I swear to God, I thought I was driving
the man to a gem and mineral show.

352
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,438
All of a sudden he has me
pulling into your restaurant...

353
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:11,073
...and telling me
that he's Investigating you.

354
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,999
Look, you and I,
we've had our differences...

355
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,030
...but I would never--

356
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:24,393
Look, my brother-ln-law,
evIdence-wlse, has nothing.

357
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,795
He's operating on pure conjecture.

358
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,593
And no one, not one person
that he works with...

359
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,395
...thinks that you are anyone other
than an owner of a fast-food chain.

360
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,755
But if something were to happen
to Hank?

361
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,397
That would only draw their attention
to you and therefore, to me, as well.

362
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,832
We have a mutual interest
in resolving this without violence.

363
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:51,509
lwIll make sure
that he discovers nothing.

364
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,714
JesseI

365
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,312
What? 0h, hey.
Don't wait to be, like, lnvlted.

366
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,158
Are we alone?

367
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,678
-So where do we stand?
-Where do we stand on what?

368
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:18,633
Where do we stand with the thing
that you were supposed to do?

369
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,318
I assume you haven't done it.

370
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,989
You didn't lose it, did you?
You would tell me if you lost it, right?

371
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,758
Oh, Jesus.

372
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,916
Asshole. You're creaming
to get it done, go do it yourself.

373
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,270
If he didn't see me coming
like he's some kind of....

374
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,798
All right, look.
Our tlmetable has advanced.

375
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:41,549
You have got to make this meeting
happen this week.

376
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,591
Tomorrow. Tonight, if possible.

377
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,554
Oh, tonight. What are you, high?

378
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,514
My brother-in-law,
my DEA agent brother-in-law?

379
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,955
He's onto Gus.

380
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,836
Did you hear what I just said?
My brother-in-law is onto Gus.

381
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,032
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it,
your brother-in-law. Okay, I'm thinking.

382
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:17,314
Look. So, what If this Is
llke math or algebra?

383
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,638
We add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag...

384
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,229
...and you get, like,
zero douche bags.

385
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,476
I've got some math for you.

386
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,116
Hank catchlng Gus
equals Hank catchlng us.

387
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,592
Hank, he's relentless, all right?
He won't quit.

388
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,712
Yeah, well, he's got nothing,
Is all I can say.

389
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,957
-How would you know that?
-Because he's still above ground.

390
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,711
Think a dude like Gus would let
your boy anywhere near him?

391
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,752
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry glmp ass.

392
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:56,435
So you haven't even seen him
since that time at the diner?

393
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,397
Okay.

394
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,799
Thlnk. All right.

395
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:14,548
They've got to be figuring
that we've talked.

396
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,596
So you need to tell Mike that you
are worried about Hank's investigation.

397
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,996
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

398
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,876
And besides, you actually did kill Gale,
so there's that.

399
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,914
This is all good fodder for you
to request a sit-down with Gus...

400
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,395
...so you can discuss
what you would say for questioning.

401
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,558
Okay? Now, you just say
that you want to be--

402
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,547
No, that you need to be able
to be properly coached.

403
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,750
Then, when you're near him...

404
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,393
...you put this to use.

405
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:50,630
Mike's just gonna tell me
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

406
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,435
-He ain't gonna set up no meeting.
-Well, then insist on it, damn it!

407
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,312
Act panlcked.

408
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,396
Gus' ass is on the line.

409
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,273
He'll meet with you
If he thinks you're a lIabIlIty.

410
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,268
No. He will waste me
If he thinks I'm a lIabIlIty.

411
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,953
You know what?

412
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,752
Whatever, man.

413
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,075
I'm gonna take a piss.

414
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,237
I think you got a phone call.

415
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,638
Anything important?

416
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,913
-Yes?
-I dId some dIggIng around.

417
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,553
-And?
-Nelther the DEA...

418
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,671
...nor the APD conslders you
a person of Interest.

419
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,598
Schrader Is IookIng Into you
totally on Ms Ionesome.

420
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,472
-A voice in the wilderness.
-Does he have resources?

421
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,831
Just hIm, hIs and" card
and Ms chauffeur Walter.

422
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,318
He'd be committing career suicide if he
were to mention you to Merkert again.

423
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,875
-No warrant for that trackIng devIce?
-No.

424
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:06,788
The guy has gone totally maverick.
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

425
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,718
We watch our backs,
we don't throw him any bones.

426
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,239
He'll never make a case.

427
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:15,234
-What about Chlle?
-lfl can't ﬁnd any trace before '89...

428
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,715
...I seriously doubt Schrader can.

429
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,717
Seems to me
the bigger problem Is the cartel.

430
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,548
Now, we can handle them
if that's all we've got on our plate.

431
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,391
But dealing with both Schrader
and the Mexicans at the same time?

432
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,673
If he happens to be watching
when they make a move...

433
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,678
...it could be the perfect storm.

434
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,354
Thank you.

435
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,390
I'll be In touch.

436
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:13,156
I don't know how many grandmas
and grandpas we got.

437
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,476
Is there a couple of them
In vIewIng Iand?

438
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,150
Well, it's ”The Grandparent's Polka. ”

439
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,832
Hello, Hector.

440
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,515
The cartel has given me
Its ultimatum.

441
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,756
To which I've said no.

442
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,116
DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.

443
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,079
He's looking into my past.

444
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,151
ls today the day, Hector?

445
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,232
Gustavo, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

446
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,354
It's a good plan. Trust yourself.

447
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,278
Everything is going to be okay.

448
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,992
Are you crazy?

449
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,471
The boss is gonna rip your balls off!

450
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:52,750
What, you gonna tell?

451
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,873
And you?

452
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:59,675
They like what they see.

453
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,835
You're not going to offer
our guests anything?

454
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,310
Who says they're guests?

455
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,110
If the boss wants them to drink...

456
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,632
...they drink.

457
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:32,632
So...the Chicken Brothers.

458
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,152
I like your restaurant.

459
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:42,078
Dark meat and white meat?

460
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,709
Don't look like no brothers to me.

461
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,234
At last!

462
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,952
The master chefs!

463
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,639
You two....

464
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:57,514
That chicken you cook....

465
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,237
I swear, it has got to be the tastiest
chicken in all of Mexico.

466
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,875
Thank you, Don Eladio.

467
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,549
It's a great honour.

468
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,915
Max Is the chef.

469
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,711
The compliments are all his.

470
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,348
Gustavo is too modest.

471
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,396
There'd be no restaurant without him.

472
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,713
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.

473
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,032
Your chicken, it's so...zesty.

474
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,279
quuant.

475
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:25,312
But It does not taste
like a Mexican style.

476
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,517
It's a recipe I learned in Chile...

477
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:30,392
...which I've modified a bit
for the Mexican palate.

478
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:35,116
I bet we like a little more chllll
than you Chlleans.

479
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,918
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!

480
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,957
So...if your partner is the chef...

481
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,358
...then who are you?

482
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:55,757
Don't tell me you are just the taster!

483
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,196
I handle the business operations.

484
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,993
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.

485
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,917
Es eI businessman.

486
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,668


487
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,871
But tell me something.

488
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:14,594
That chicken, so fabulous...

489
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,430
...so excellent....

490
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,149
Besides that, what else
do you have on your menu?

491
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,559
We have several side dishes.

492
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:24,751


493
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,429
Sometimes we prepare
a carnltas entree...

494
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:30,319
...If we come across fresh beef
In the market.

495
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,555
Anything else?

496
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,112
Come on, be honest.

497
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,879
There is nothing else you offer?
A little taste of something else?

498
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,718
Something on the side?

499
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,512
Because when I send my men
to your restaurant...

500
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,632
...they come back
with more than just chicken.

501
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,315
They come back with drugs.

502
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,038
Regresan hlgh.

503
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,274
You are selling them narcotics.

504
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,153
Methamphetamine.

505
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,271
With all due respect, Don Eladio.

506
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,912
I didn't sell it to them.

507
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,838
I gave them samples.

508
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,153


509
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:19,388
Some businessman.

510
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:22,991
I gave them samples to give to you.

511
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,071
To introduce you to our product.

512
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,316
Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offence.

513
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,439
But he...that is to say we...

514
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,552
...could think of no other way
to get your attention.

515
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,675
We want to work with you, Don Eladio.

516
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:42,235
I know all about methamphetamine.

517
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,756
That's poor man's cocaine.

518
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:54,353
Only bikers and hillbillies use it.

519
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,232
There's no money in it.

520
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:00,032
May I, Don Eladio....

521
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:02,350
lam a biochemist by training.

522
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,988
The methamphetamine we make
is much superior...

523
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:08,351
...to the so-called blker crank
you know of.

524
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,232
It is crystallised, like glass.

525
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,755
Purer.

526
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,995
And the chirality of the molecule...

527
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,429
...its very structure, is different.

528
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,471
The narcotic effect is far more potent.

529
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:21,671
This product is the drug of the future.

530
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,511
lt'll triple your profits.

531
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,709
Perhaps quadruple.

532
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,437
They're not only good cooks...

533
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,517
...they're great at shovelling manure.

534
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,470
Right now, you deal almost exclusively
with cocaine.

535
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,670
But the coca plant can't grow
In Mexico.

536
00:38:46,399 --> 00:38:48,788
You are no more than middlemen...

537
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,876
...for the Colombians.

538
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,433
They cut you a percentage for
smuggling across the border.

539
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,310
But the lion's share
of the profits goes to them...

540
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,109
...desplte your assumption
of all the risk.

541
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,757
This new crystal methamphetamine....

542
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:17,077
...which means
It will move In higher volume.

543
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:20,112
But most lmportantly,
It's completely artlflclal.

544
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,510
We can show you
how to manufacture It...

545
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,789
...right here in Mexico.

546
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:27,079
And you keep all the profits.

547
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:33,597
My men do like your product.

548
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,952
Hector, what is wrong with you?

549
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,436
Why dId you not get glasses
for our guests?

550
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,396


551
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:53,317
You are quite the talent.

552
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,153
I bet you learned cooking
from your mama. Isn't that true?

553
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,915
But...what about the chemistry?

554
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,074
I studied at the University of Santiago.

555
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,390
Gustavo paid for my education.

556
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,589
Oh, really?

557
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,235
l have degrees in both biochemistry
and chemical engineering.

558
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,794
With minimal capital investment...

559
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:21,314
...we can set up
a factory-grade laboratory for you.

560
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,592
Train your own people
to manufacture large quantities...

561
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,551
...of highly pure methamphetamine.

562
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,914
Fantastch

563
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,068
Tell me one thing, though.

564
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,635
If you're the cook....

565
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,876
Why do I need him?

566
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,674
Sehor?

567
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,028
You.

568
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,718


569
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,596
Why should I negotiate with someone
who doesn't respect me?

570
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,951
Who insults me by dealing
under my nose without my permission?

571
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:00,837
Who manipulates me into a meeting...

572
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,276
...in front of my own men?

573
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,554
What do I need you for?

574
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:11,117
Don Eladio. Please.

575
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:12,877
I didn't sell anything.

576
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,151
I apologise if you are offended...

577
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,396
...by my method
of obtaining this meeting.

578
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,832
l merely took the initiative.

579
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,628
I meant no insult.

580
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,911
Don EladIo,
Gustavo dIdn't mean to offend.

581
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,718
I know Gustavo like a brother.

582
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,148
He's an honourable man.

583
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,954
The most loyal man I have ever known.

584
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,311
He rescued me
from the Santiago slums.

585
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,032
He made me the man I am today!

586
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,870
Gustavo Is a genius.
He will make you mllllonsI

587
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,436
Just find it in your heart to forgive him
this one small mistake.

588
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:47,234
Please...

589
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,915
He's my partner.

590
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,753
I need him! I swear to God!

591
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:28,714
Look at him.

592
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,353
You did this to him.

593
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,236
Now, look at him.

594
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,918
Listen to me.

595
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,991
The only reason you are alive
and he Is not...

596
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,317
...is because I know who you are.

597
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,115
But understand....

598
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,677
You are not in Chile anymore.

599
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,713
My advlce....

600
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,877
Stick to chicken.

601
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,431
Look at me, Hector.

602
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:06,796
Look at me.

603
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,871
Maybe next time.
