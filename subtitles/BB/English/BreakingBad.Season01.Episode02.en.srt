1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,189
Ara you okay?

2
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,632
-You are a llfanvar.
-Yeah, man.

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,308
-Wo can't thank you onough.
-No, hay, mad props.

4
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,317
I could have sworn the guy said south.

5
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,954
But then all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,993
I'm trying to read the map while
driving, a bonehead manoeuvre.

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,998
And then all of a sudden, bam,
we're in that ditch.

8
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,633
Yeah, barn. I'm like,
'What the hall?â€˜ You know?

9
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:12,354
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug.
Of coffee? My mug of coffee.

10
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:16,154
It spills allover my pants, I mean--
Just a nightmare.

11
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,158
There's your Sony GPs,
I mean, for real.

12
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:34,637
Lot's Just...

13
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,435
leo I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.

14
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,677
Can't we just dump them here?

15
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,632
What, and somebody finds them?

16
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,828
Then what?

17
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,395
People have seen us.

18
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,432
Hey, you're gonna flood it, man.

19
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,199
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

20
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,629
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

21
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,352
We're gonna clean up this mess.

22
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,311
And you, start.

23
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,757
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.

24
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,188
All right.

25
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,756
All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,518
The RV is going to start right now.

27
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,075
It's gonna start.
We're gonna drive It to your house.

28
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,268
-My house?
-Your house.

29
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,913
We're gonna drive it over there
and park it overnight.

30
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,350
-And then tomorrow--
-Man, not my house.

31
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,996
Shut up. Shut up.

32
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,516
After we finish
cleaning up this mess...

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,678
...we will go our separate ways.

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,599
Our paths will never cross.

35
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,950
And we will tell this to no one.

36
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,878
Understood?

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,038
Oh, what, I can talk now?

38
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,311
Fine. That goes double for me.

39
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,953
Okay. Okay.

40
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,877
Be good to me.

41
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,512
Yesl

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,516
Yes. Okay. Okay.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,035
Thank you.

44
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,792
0h, shlt.

45
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,991
Walt?

46
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,190
You coming out?

47
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,628
Yeah, absolutely.

48
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,474
We've got looky-loos
In both directions, Dan.

49
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,995
Better plan on being late
if you're going to work.

50
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,592
This is Lisa in the Skycopter, we'll have
more Albuquerque traffic on the hour.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,639
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

52
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,238
We had a faculty meeting
last Thursday...

53
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,910
...and the topic was
senior-class photos...

54
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,588
...and how we had Instituted
a new rule last year...

55
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,598
...that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken...

56
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,869
...by a photographer of their choice.

57
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,389
You know, not necessarily
the photographer...

58
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,159
...that the school hires, right? So--

59
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,796
So anyway,
some of the senior glrls...

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,835
...were going to that Glamour Shots
place to have their photos taken.

61
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,315
And now they're bringing us
all these photos...

62
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,351
...and Joan Everman--
You know Joan.

63
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,551
--suddenly has to go through
all the photos...

64
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,274
...and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

65
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,988
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetle?

66
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,036
Yeah. I'm good.

67
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,309
Okay.

68
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,718
You know, even the
small-busted girls have cleavage.

69
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,789
Apparently there's some new type of
brassiere or something.

70
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,559
The Wonderbra.

71
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,670
It's the Wonderbra.

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,399
Yeah?

73
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,070
Okay.

74
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,671
Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.

75
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,110
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

76
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,516
Hello, Mr. White.
This is AMT calling.

77
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,632
Are you happy with your current
long-distance service?

78
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,797
Because if you're not,
I would definitely really, really love...

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,070
...to talk to you
as soon as possible about--

80
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,077
Hello, this is Walter White speaking.

81
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,191
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

82
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,957
You said he would die any minute.

83
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,276
Listen, lam having breakfast
with my family right now...

84
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,278
...and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

85
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,754
Weii, too bad, man,
because guess what.

86
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,109
He's still not dead.

87
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,911
I went and put my ear to the RV.

88
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,997
I can hear him, like,
rolling around In there, all right?

89
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,316
I think he's awake, man.
I think he's trying to get loose.

90
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,555
Where the hell are you?
i'm freaking out here.

91
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,354
-Calm down, damn it.
-You gonna help me clean this up?

92
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:04,517
-We got loose ends here.
-Calm down.

93
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,233
I will be there after school.

94
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,396
After school. Are you shitting me?

95
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,517
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

96
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,234
Llsten, that Is Just
not gonna work for me.

97
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,998
I'm not interested in that at all.

98
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,351
And I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

99
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,916
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

100
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,195
-You have a good day, sweetle.
-Okay, Mom. You too.

101
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,038
Bye, honey.

102
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,714
-Drlve safe.
-Okay.

103
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:54,187
Yo, yo, ya, 1, 4. 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the A30.

104
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,869
What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.

105
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,915
So the term "chiral"...

106
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,317
...derlves from the
Greek word 'hand.'

107
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,233
Now, the concept here being that just
as your left hand and your right hand...

108
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,672
...are mirror images of one another,
right, identical and yet opposite...

109
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
...well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist...

110
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,389
...as mlrror-lmage forms
of one another...

111
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,510
...all the way down
at the molecular level.

112
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:42,155
But although they may
look the same...

113
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,556
...they don't always behave the same.

114
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,796
For |nstance....

115
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,037
For Instance.

116
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,189
I'm sorry. For |nstance....

117
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,878
Thalldomlde.

118
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,596
The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

119
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,631
...is a perfectly fine, good medicine...

120
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,593
...to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

121
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,349
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman...

122
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,712
...the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

123
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,313
...and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

124
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:25,669
Which is precisely what happened
in the 1950s.

125
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,796
So chlral, chlrallty,
mlrrored Images, right?

126
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,312
Active, inactive, good, bad.

127
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,834


128
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,712
-Yes, Ben.
-Is this gonna be on the murder?

129
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,549
What?

130
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,069
Is this gonna be on the midterm?

131
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,918
Chirallty on the midterm?
No, no. Well, maybe.

132
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:00,158
Maybe. Yes, you know--
But prepare for it to be on the midterm.

133
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,476
Can't hurt to know it, right? So--

134
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,830
Knowledge is power.

135
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,714
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.

136
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,756
Not good. Not good, not good.

137
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,392
What the--?

138
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,752
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

139
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,677
Hey, llsten, you.

140
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,472


141
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,788
Oh, God.

142
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,753
Okay.

143
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,116
MILFs?

144
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,511
The hell is a MILF?

145
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,278
Now what?

146
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,750
Lock the other one out in the RV.

147
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,631


148
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,908
-You're sure?
-Yes.

149
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,553
-You're positive?
-You know what?

150
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,274
-Feel free to go check.
-Good idea. Maybe I should...

151
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,595
...before he, too, wanders off
down the street.

152
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,074
-Okay, you know what? I am sick--
-All right.

153
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,598
Just--

154
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,473
The one downstalrs,
tell me about him.

155
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,991
Oh, come on. Anything. Something.
Start with his name, at least.

156
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,108
Krazy-8.
What the hell does that even mean?

157
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,711
I don't know, man, okay? It means,
like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

158
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,717
So you work with him regularly.

159
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,797
No, not him so much.

160
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,560
-H|s cousln, malnly.
-Who's his cousin?

161
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,479
-The guy out In the RV.
-All right, all right, all right.

162
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,069
Krazy-8's one level higher.

163
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,678
One level higher.

164
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,350
Yeah, you know.
Not, like, street level. Higher.

165
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,278
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

166
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:45,949
Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells
Starbucks' beans.

167
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,672
Okay, so he's a distributor.

168
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,035
Okay, so is he...? I mean, is...?

169
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:57,630
In other words,
what Is his reputation for vIolence?

170
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,836
Well, he did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

171
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,190
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

172
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,675
He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

173
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,996
It would therefore
seem to follow that he ls...

174
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,795
...capable of acting out of
mutual self-Interest, yes?

175
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,429
What?

176
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,111
Do you think he Is capable
of listening to reason?

177
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,879
What kind of reason? You mean,
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen...

178
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,595
...if I let you go, you promise not to
come back and waste my entire family?

179
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,029
No Colombian necktles?'
That kInd of reason?

180
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,835
No, man, I can't say as l have high
fucking hopes where that's concerned.

181
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,518
What was that?

182
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,593
What was what?

183
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,238
We didn't tie him up.

184
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,034
-Why the hell dIdn't we tle him up?
-Oh, God.

185
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,755
-Because he was out cold.
-Yeah, but what if he's faking it?

186
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,032
You know, like, if it was me,
I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo.

187
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,518
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit.

188
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,756
Ready to pounce.

189
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,118
No, see. Now, if it was me...

190
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,708
...and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon...

191
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,389
...I would just lle back down
and bIde my time.

192
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,233
So now what do we do?

193
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,313
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.

194
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,268
-Well, you gotta do something.
-We.

195
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,596
We have got to do something,
and lam open to suggestions.

196
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,154
Man, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

197
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,078
Don't you dare put that on me.

198
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,397
You brought those guys out there.
This is your responsibility.

199
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,794
Like I came to you,
beggIng to cook meth.

200
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:07,231
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please.

201
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,031
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny...

202
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:11,878
...but her wheelchair wouldn't fit
In the RV.

203
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:20,712
What about the phosphate gas?

204
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,309
Phosphine gas. What about it?

205
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,987
I mean, do you think
It still might kill him?

206
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,634
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

207
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,268
I don't know.

208
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,835
-You're supposed to be a scientist.
-Look.

209
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,113
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

210
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,595
We have got a body in that RV.
And it's getting warmer outside.

211
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,993
Understand?

212
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,272
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

213
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,630
And In a way that
no one will ever find It.

214
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,436
Now, that last part
Is very, very Important.

215
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,357
Therefore, it seems to me...

216
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,873
...that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.

217
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,917
Dissolving in strong acid.

218
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,079
Oh, man, that's messed up.

219
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,077
I mean, you're not serious.

220
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,872
You serlous?

221
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,431
Well, who's gonna do that?

222
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,436
And don't look at me.

223
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,676
I guess we'll both do it together.

224
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,871
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

225
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,076
Look, we are in this fifty-fifty. Okay?

226
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,799
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be...

227
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:03,789
...that one of us deals with
the body sItuatIon...

228
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:10,029
...while the other one of us deals with
the Krazy-8 situation.

229
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:20,189
In a scenarIo like this,
I don't suppose It Is bad form...

230
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:24,631
...to just flip a coin.

231
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,550
-Heads or tails?
-No, I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

232
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,394
Heads or talls?

233
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,919
Heads. Heads.

234
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,876
Best two out of three?

235
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,948
Yo, yo, ya, 1, 4. 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the A30.

236
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,630
What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.

237
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,199
Hey, Mr. White, it's me. Pick up.

238
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,994
I got a container question.

239
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,838
Hello, Mr. White.
Pick up the phone, man.

240
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,235
-Yes.
-Yo, what kInd of plastic, man?

241
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,352
Polyethylene.

242
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,756
How the hell am I
supposed to know that?

243
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,359
Because I told you.

244
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,954
Look, just look at the bottom
for a triangle...

245
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,310
...stamped LDPE.

246
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,312
It should be moulded into the plastic.

247
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,908
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got It.

248
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,237
I don't know, man.
This feels kInd of fllmsy.

249
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,794
Any decent acld's
gonna eat right through this.

250
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,396
-Not hydrofluoric.
-Why not?

251
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,639
Look, you skipped, clowned around...

252
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,389
...or otherwise jerked off
through every lecture I ever gave.

253
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,672
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

254
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:33,196
Oh, okay, be a dick about it. Jesus.

255
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:39,634
So, hey, have you done the thing?

256
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,514
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

257
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,474
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

258
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,392
You know, not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

259
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,713
Now, If It was me,
I would just try and think of It...

260
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,389
...like I was doing him a favour.

261
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,312
i need a cheque approval
on checkstand eight.

262
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,195
Approval on checkstand eight, please.
Thank you.

263
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,272
Yeah.

264
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:13,837
Who's there?

265
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,319
What, you fucking break in?
Show me who's there.

266
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,714
Yeah. I see you.

267
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,994
What you gonna do?

268
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:33,628
Hey.

269
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,353
Hey--I

270
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,597
Hey.

271
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,271
I need water.

272
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,070
Hey, hello.

273
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,674
Bring me some water, would you?

274
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,318
Please.

275
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,636
You don't like the crust?

276
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,109
Where's my cousin Emilio?

277
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,751
He dead?

278
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,750
Oh, I'm a coward.

279
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,236
Hey, Mr. White. Hey, Mr. White?

280
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,269
Oh, fuck.

281
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,628
Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God.

282
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,428
Wait a minute, is that my weed?

283
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,833
What the hell, man? Make yourself
at home, why don't you?

284
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,994
-So, what'd you end up buyIng?
-Nothlng.

285
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,314
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

286
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,035
I don't suppose
you could buy two bIns?

287
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:59,914
And just:

288
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,595
Legs in one, torso in the other?

289
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,472
Oh, God.

290
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:08,916
I don't suppose
you could kIss my ass?

291
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,710


292
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,791
...how'd It go?

293
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,030
-You dIdn't do It?
-Not yet.

294
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:35,754
Oh, God.

295
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,713
-Oh, damn. I gotta go.
-Hey, hey.

296
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,713
What? No, no, no. Come back here.

297
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,196
-Sorry. I'll do It tomorrow, I promise.
-Tomorrow.

298
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,395
I've got a doctor's appointment.
I gotta go.

299
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,831
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.

300
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,194
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

301
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,075
We fllpped a coin.

302
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,350
We're good?

303
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,912
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.

304
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,117
Oh, would you look at that face?
Smlle, peanut.

305
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,114
So who's up for knowing?

306
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,352
lt's....

307
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,748
Yeah.

308
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,718
-G|rl.
-Glrl?

309
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,831
-You sure?
-Pretty sure.

310
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,393
Oh, God. Can I tell you,
that's exactly what I was hoping.

311
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,192
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

312
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:52,272
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

313
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,870
Looking fabulous. Let me see
if they're done with the blood sugar...

314
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:00,435
...then we'll get you out of here.
I'll be right back.

315
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,515
Who's Jesse Pinkman?

316
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,715
-Jesse...?
-Jesse Plnkman.

317
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,912
He called just this morning.

318
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,754
-Walt, please don't deny It.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

319
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,350
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

320
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,279
-Was he one of your students?
-Yeah.

321
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,870
He was nobody.

322
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,391
Who is he to you? Why is he calling?
What is this big secret...

323
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,230
...you seem to be discussing
with some druggie burnout?

324
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,389
You don't come home last night until 2
in the morning. You don't tell me...

325
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,839
...where you've been. You spent
the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.

326
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,677
Tell me what's going on with you.
Don't you think you owe me that?

327
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,713
Who is this Jesse Pinkman to you?

328
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,509
He sells me pot.

329
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,596
-He sells you pot?
-Marljuana, yeah.

330
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:48,111
Not a lot. I mean, I don't know.

331
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,675
I kind of like It.

332
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,556
Are you out of your mind?
What are you, like, 16 years old?

333
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,709
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
What is wrong with you?

334
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,629
Look, Skyler...

335
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,232
...I just haven't
quite been myself lately.

336
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:18,277
-Yeah. No shit. Thanks for noticing.
-I haven't been myself lately...

337
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,471
...but I love you.

338
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,154
Nothing about that has changed.
Nothing ever will.

339
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,233
So right now, what I need...

340
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:33,512
...Is for you to clImb down
out of my ass.

341
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:40,267
Can you do that?
Will you do that for me, honey?

342
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:45,678
Will you please, just once,
get off my ass?

343
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,639
You know.

344
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:52,117
I'd appreciate it. I really would.

345
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,553
Stop.

346
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,232
Stop In 15 minutes.

347
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,630
Your face is too sharp.

348
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,233
Powder. Powderi
Take a powder, go on.

349
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,113
Nice. Beautiful talcum powder.
Lucky you, number eight.

350
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,759
Just meat,
It's all just a bunch of meat.

351
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,469
Oh, Jesus.

352
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,878
You're cool, you're cool.

353
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,232
You're all good, you're all--
You're all good. You know It.

354
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:41,354
It's fine. It's just a bunch of meat.
Come on. You're good.

355
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,915


356
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,672
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.
May I talk to you?

357
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:15,350
Hey, hey, hey.
This Is private property.

358
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,239
-Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.
-No, not interested.

359
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:22,313
-Come on.
-Hey, don't touch me. Do not touch me.

360
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,516
All right. Look, not touching.
Not touching.

361
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,279
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

362
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:33,873
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.

363
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,837
He told me everything.

364
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,949
-Ser|ously?
-That's right.

365
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:46,149
And just so you know,
my brother-in-law is a DEA agent...

366
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,957
...and I will not hesitate to call him.
Not if I have to. Understood?

367
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,070
This is your one and only warning.

368
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,154
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.

369
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,551
You stay away from him,
or you will be one sorry individual.

370
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,879
-You get me?
-I think so, yeah.

371
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,629
No more marijuana. I can dig it.

372
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,037
You can dig it. Wonderful.

373
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:36,397
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider...

374
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,476
...a different line of work.

375
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,592
Okay.

376
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:35,828
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go to your house, you know.

377
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,875
Makes perfect sense. Let's
completely screw up your house...

378
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,631
...so you never wanna spend another
night in it. Sure. You know, why not?

379
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,630
Yeah, and how's about
I send over my psycho-bitch wife...

380
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,433
...to, you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

381
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,510
God, that would be hilarious,
you know.

382
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,914
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement...

383
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,078
...the one who's completely
my responsibility...

384
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:09,351
...hell, let's just
let him live down there.

385
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,873
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like, three times a day.

386
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:20,876
Sure, why not? It's been really amazing.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

387
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,558
I always dreamt about, I don't know,
melting bodies.

388
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,149
You got a brother
In the goddamn DEA?

389
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,434
-What?
-You saId you were...

390
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,111
...just doing some ride-along. Yes or
no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

391
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:04,752
-He's a brother-in-law.
-Well, there's a load off my mind.

392
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:06,068
Where did you hear that?

393
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:09,989
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up in my shit.

394
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,908
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio.

395
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,070
Good job on
wearIng the pants In the family.

396
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,200
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

397
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,035
Because somehow
It seemed preferable...

398
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,471
...to admitting that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

399
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:38,112
Is that what I think it is?

400
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:41,829
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl.
So what? My house, my rules.

401
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:44,236
Hey, no, no.
Don't gIve me that, okay?

402
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:48,751
I held up my end. I already took care of
Emilio. You're still diddling around...

403
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,314
-...trylng to get your nut up.
-Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

404
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,350
l have the truly awful job here.

405
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,516
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

406
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,679
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

407
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,996
I barely got him in the bathtub.

408
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,472
Bathtub, what...?
What do you mean, bathtub?

409
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,147
Another thing. Why you got me
running around town...

410
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,555
...trylng to find
some stupid pIece of plastic...

411
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:12,875
...when l have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

412
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:18,788
Oh, God.

413
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:21,390
Hey. Hey.

414
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,270
I'm sorry, what were you askIng me?
Oh, yes.

415
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:21,518
That stupld plastic container
I asked you to buy.

416
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:25,155
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

417
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,594
It wIll, however, dIssolve metal,
rock, glass, ceramlc.

418
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:33,835
So there's that.

419
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,031
Okay, here we go.

420
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,397
Okay.

421
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,437
Here I go.
