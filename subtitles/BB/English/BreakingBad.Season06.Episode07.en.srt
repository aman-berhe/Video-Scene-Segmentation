The musIc stopped,

-They hIgh-fIved because It worked.
-Such a bltch. He won't qult.

Oh, what the hell?

Heart wants what

79
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,955
Let's go back and watch some more

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,476

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,238
They murdered Hank.
They stole my lll'e's work.

95
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,831
I don't know any hlt men.

96
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,314
You know a guy who knows a guy.

You're worrled about

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,829
Don't leave.

103

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,673
...but some people mlght say

105
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,914
Some people would be
Ignorant on the facts.

106
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,079
Some people wouldn't know that
as far as the pollce are concerned...

107
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,112
...Skyler Is a blameless vlctlm.

00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,157


109
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,270
Get It off your chest.

110
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,117


111
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,754
The phone call was a smart move.
Kudos to you.

112
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,632
Odds are It was recorded.
It'll play great for a Jury.

113
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,591
It mlght even buy her a mlstrlal.

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,868
In a year and a hall'. Untll then,
If they don't have you, they go after her.

115
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,638
There's no polnt. She knows nothlng.

116
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,678
Well, too bad.
She's got nothlng to trade.

117
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,153
I hate to be a downer here...

118
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:27,157
...but there are two DEA agents mlsslng,
presumed dead.

119
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,591
Thlnk the feds wlll let that go

120
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,153

...they wlll Rlco
your wll'e and klds out of the house.

122
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,632
That condo ls gone.

123
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,557
Your bank accounts, they're I'rozen.

124
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,469
Her plcture's probably on TV rlght now,
next to yours. Who's gonna hlre her?

125
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,956
-Money's no problem.
-Well, I don't mean to contradlct you...

...but gettlng It to her, lmposslble.

127
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,674
The I'eds are praylng
that you'll make contact.

128
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,075
The Internet, the phone, It's all tapped.

129
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,395
Hey, Mlke was no dummy.

130
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:59,114
But every tlme he trled to get
hls nest egg to hls granddaughter...

131
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,311
...It ended up In Uncle Sam's pockets.

132
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,993
So you propose what?

133
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,992

135

And you brlng a barrel
full of drug money.

139
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,070
Maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

140
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,839
Maybe they let your I'amlly stay
In the house.

141
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,076
After all, the house predates
the crlmlnal enterprlse.

142
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,110
God, you thlnk I want to run?

143
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,709
Thls Is the last thlng that I want.

144

My money goes to my chlldren.

147

Because you really

224
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,589

225
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:49,515

-You don't have to say the name.

230
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,957
Sure. And It went really good.

00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,038
I mean, the message was recelved

232
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,477

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,428
You're not Western Unlon.

238
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:40,472
We can't Just settle

239
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:45,597
Really, If you'd been there,
I thlnk you'd see It dll'l'erent.

240
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,551
We threw a real scare Into her.

241
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,638
She seems llke a nlce lady
watchlng out for her klds.

242
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,948
So you're not golng to have
a problem wlth her.

243
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,311
-I can pretty much guarantee It.
-I wlsh I had your certalnty...

244
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,237
...but I'm not llke you and your uncle.

245
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,795
I'm Just--
I'm not used to thls klnd ol' rlsk.

246
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:06,149
We're gonna have to take a break.

and ready to go.

248

And I wlsh you all the luck
In the world wlth It.

249
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,917

00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,998
I'm sorry?

251
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,635
Nlnety-two percent.

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,914
-Truly?
-Tested It twlce.

253
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,395
And It's blue, Just llke bel'ore.

He's not wlth you?

256
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,472

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,676
...mutually good.

00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:26,630
NInety-two percent.

265
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,230
Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshlre.

266
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,997
All rlght.

267
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,509
Let's have a look at thls place.

268
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,152
You got about a month's worth
of food on hand.

269
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,114
Most of It's canned goods,
but there's steaks In the freezer.

270
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,756
You got a generator outslde,
works on LP.

271
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,394
Ought to be enough In the tank
to last the wlnter.

272
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,879
It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do
for the llghts, the TV, and the freezer.

273
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:46,228
That's a wood-burner.

274
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,590
Ought to warm the place up
pretty good.

275
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,949
Plus you can cook on It.

276
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,752
On the TV front,
the receptlon's pretty much nll.

277
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:57,393
You got some mountalns In the way.

278
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,273
Weather's rlght, you mlght
be able to catch Montreal...

279
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,948
...but mostly you'll be llmlted to DVDs.

280
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,470
Mr. MagorIum's Wonder EmporIum.

281
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,157
Two coples.

282
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,035
I'm not much of a movle guy.

283
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,392
I'll make a supply run next month.

284
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,796
You want somethlng else to watch,
put It on the llst.

285
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,109
Supply run.

286
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,992
Fltty thousand dollars
for a trlp to Costco.

287
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,427
It's rlsk.

288
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,357
And rlsk Is what you're paylng me for,
not tollet paper.

289
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,029
Rlsk and a 44oo-mlle round trlp.

290
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,431
Mr. Lambert...

291
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,509
...my cllents and I don't usually have
an ongolng relatlonshlp.

292
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,837
Normally you and I would have already
gone our separate ways...

293
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,428
...but you're you.

294
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,033
-Where's the phone?
-No phone.

295
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:58,553
Up here, Ice storms equal servlce calls,
equal you In cuffs.

296
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,989
-lnternet?
-Same deal.

297
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:05,431
Also satelllte, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

298
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:08,871
You want news,
I'll brlng the Albuquerque papers.

299
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,150
Whatever you need,
Just put It on the llst.

300
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:12,627
Put It on the llst. Yeah.

301
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,228
Look, I have buslness to conduct.

302
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,477
Your buslness Is your buslness.

303
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,399
My buslness ls keeplng you
out of custody.

304
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,398
You are the target
of a natlon-wlde manhunt.

305
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,511
Your face Is all over TV.

306
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,077
You are the hottest cllent
l have ever had, by far.

307
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:38,076
It stands to reason
you've got to keep out of slght.

308
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,317
And what's keeplng me
from walklng out that gate?

309
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,918
Nothlng.

310
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,877
There's a llttle one-horse town
elght mlles down the hlll.

311
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,149
There's not a thlng
on God's green earth...

312
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,715
...that I can do to stop you
golng down there.

313
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,318
All I'm saylng ls...

314
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:58,788
...lf you leave thls place,
you wlll get caught.

315
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,953
And I gotta tell you...

316
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,629
...II I flnd out that

317
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,991
...I won't be comlng back.

318
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,715
That Is for my own safety.
You understand?

319
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,559
Sure.

320
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,318

321
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,193
-The flue can be trlcky.
-Yeah, I got It.

322
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,876
You pald good money for thls.

323
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,436
You got two acres up here,
lots of woods, nlce, warm place.

324
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,313
Seems to me Just the spot for a man
to rest up and thlnk on thlngs.

325
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,638
If you look around, It's klnd of beautlful.

326
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,152
You've been very helpful. Thank you.

Oh, so you're Just too good

330
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,233
-lt's not for me.
-Damn, man, serlously.

331
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,869
That's not my chocolate chlp, Is It?

332
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,076
You're gonna spoll hlm.

333

Hey, you awake?

Almost forgot.

384
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,669
Wlthout a prescrlptlon, I had to take
an educated guess and shotgun It.

385
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,234
One of these ought to come close.

386
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,316

There's no court date yet.

391
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:02,831
The news was taIkIng about
a grand Jury, but they dldn't say when.

392
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,271
I saw her publlc defender on TV.

Just-- Just dle.

514
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,355
Wagner hasn't had to be
really stellar tonlght.

515
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,198
Made solId saves
back In the ﬁrst perIod.

516
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,710
You know, Mlchael, that's probably--
Golng back, look at Wagner's numbers...

517
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,799
you know, It seems llke he's one of
the last goalIes In the league.

518
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,514
They don't wanna
put pressure on thls guy.

519
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,314
KevIn Granato looks to make a move,
had the puck taken.

520
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,277
Denver comes back out
the other way.

521
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:14,555
--by Graham Melanson off Rycroft.
Who else?

522
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,593
Boy, he's been all over the Ice tonlght.

523
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,071
DEA, Albuquerque DIstrIct OI'I'Ice.

524
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,872
How may I dIrect your call?

525
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,391

--thIs Is not just a goalIe that's

532
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:50,554
Two forty-nlne remaInIng
In the thlrd perIod.

533
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:52,829
You ready for that drlnk now?

534
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,356

You got It.

536
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,676
--and Melanson
wlth a good look makes the save.

537
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,916
That's why you need good, solId
breakout passes.

538
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,391
Matt Peterson-- WIn the draw, Englehart
wIns the draw, back to Peterson...

539
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,235
...goes behlnd the net, makes a terrlble
breakout pass, goes rlght to Hackard.

540
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:15,431
He just wlnds up, puts It on net here.
Turnovers, turnovers.

541
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,757
When you get turnovers
In the oﬂenslve zone, chances happen.

542
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:20,597
Hopefully It won't happen agaIn.

543
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,755
Turnovers generally--

544
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,875
-I wasn't sure you'd come.
-I'm not stayIng--

545
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,153
-Madam, Is thls transfer good on the--?
-Darker than a normal rose--

546
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,079
For us, It's always been
scIence ﬁrst, and--

547
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:36,190
Walt, would you--? Would you--?

548
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,876
Would you go back, please?

549
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,718
-ShamWows--
-More ofa by-product.

550
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,875
-There.
-Exactly.

551
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,469
-What, thls?
-Yes.

552
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,510
But just yesterday, your charlty...

553
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,153
...the Gretchen and Hum Schwartz
Foundatlon...

554
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,636
...announced a $20 mIllIon grant...

555
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:56,627
...for drug-abuse treatment centres
throughout the Southwest.

556
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:58,670
CharlIe, the Southwest Is our home...

557
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,555
...and we couldn't just Ignore
what's golng on In our own backyard.

558
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,036
But I'm sure you're aware that there
are people who suggest other motlves.

559
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:09,436
Andrew Ross SorkIn
of The New York Tlmes...

560
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,676
...wrote a column suggestlng...

561
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,998
...that the grant was
a klnd of publIcIty manoeuvre...

562
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,475
...to shore up the stock prIce
of Gray Matter Technologles...

563
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,195
...because of your assocIatIon
wlth Walter Whlte.

564
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,075
-Well, that's not exactly the way--
-To cleanse yourselves, so to speak...

565
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:33,353
...of havIng a methamphetamlne kIngpIn
as cofounder of your company.

566
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:35,629
CharlIe, I'm glad you brought that up.

567
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,832
I have to belleve that
the Investlng publlc understands...

568
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,111
...we're taIkIng about a person
who was there early on...

569
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,153
...but who had nothlng to do
wlth the creatIon of the company...

570
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,668
...and stlll less to do wlth growlng It.

571
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,236
So, what was Walter Whlte's
contrIbutIon?

572
00:48:51,439 --> 00:48:54,829
You know, to be honest... Honey?

573
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,075
-The company name.
-The company name.

574
00:48:57,279 --> 00:48:59,839
We came up wlth It
by combInIng our names.

575
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:01,154
"Schwartz" means "black. "

576
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,591
-Black plus whlte makes grey.
-Hence Gray Matter Technologles.

577
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,395
Exactly. As far as I can recall,
hls contrIbutIon beglns and ends there.

578
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,353
There are contInuIng reports
of blue methamphetamlne...

579
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:14,995
...consIdered hls sIgnature product
throughout the Southwest...

580
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,350
...and some evIdence
of reachlng as far as Europe.

581
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,872
So my questIon Is,
Is Walter Whlte stlll out there?

582
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,957
No, he's not.

583
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,391
You sound very sure.

584
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,749
I am.

585
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:35,076
I can't speak to thls Helsenberg
that people refer to...

586
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,431
...but whatever he became...

587
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,393
...the sweet, klnd, brIllIant man...

588
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,639
...that we once knew long ago,
he's gone.

589
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,195
But to be absolutely clear....

590
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:16,394
Pollcel Handsl Show us your hands.
Show us your hands.

591
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:17,998
