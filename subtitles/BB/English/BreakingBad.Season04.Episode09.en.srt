00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,439

-Roady to get your rock: on?
-Su? I know It.

5
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:27,554
"Mineral show" is just some sort of
guy code for "strip club."

6
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,034
Yeah. You got your singles?

7
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,597
-Got It?
-Yoah.

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,754
Don't let him get too crazy, okay?

9
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,430
Cram one more giant geode in here,
we'll be sleeping in the garage.

00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,834
-Got It. I got lt.

11
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,558
Christ. Longest week ever.

12
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,189
Here's Just hoping
we get something good.

13
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,677
Keep your fingers crossed.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,715
Relax, buddy, this ain't no spy movie.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,598
It's more like Rocky, you know?

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,358
Get the bad guy.

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,234
Yeahl

18
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,678
-But-- But-- What are you doing, buddy?
-Leaving.

19
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,468
You gotta go inside, order something
like last time. Avoid suspicion.

20
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,910
Besides, I want a vanilla shake.

21
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,115
We'll use the drive-through.

22
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,558
All right, baby,
let's see what we got.

23
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,316
What the hell? Look at this.

24
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,632
That's work. That's home.
That's work, that's home.

25
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,959
What, this guy...

26
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,276
...he goes two place: every day,
all week?

27
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,637
It's unbelievable.

28
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,118
Chicken-slinging son of a bitch.

29
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,234
Hank, la It possible that maybe,
Juat maybe...

30
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,916
...he'a not your guy?

31
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,078
A guy this clean has got to be dirty.

32
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,152
What's the play here, buddy?

33
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,833
How do | get this guy?

34
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,037
Yeah.

35
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,798
How?

36
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,998
Yea, hl.

37
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,875
| live on the 4900 block of Doswell Place
and I want to report...

38
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:40,031
...a very suspicious man
lurking in my neighbourhood.

39
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,872
He's sitting in a blue sedan...

40
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,197
...and he's been staring at
a particular house for a very long time.

41
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,913
Thank you. Thank you so much.

42
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,918
If you would, I would appreciate it.

43
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,913
All right.

44
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,554
I guess we'd better get started.

45
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,592
I already did.

46
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,272
Yeah?

47
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,558
Hey.

48
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,272
Got one of those for me?

49
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
-0ne of those what?
-CIgarette.

50
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,869
Look, it's still in there, all right?
I didn't get a chance yet.

51
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,159
Just give me one.

52
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:25,115
So, what have you been up to?

53
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,839
What?

54
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,874
You know, just a day in the life.
What do you do after work?

55
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,270
Go home. Watch TV.

56
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,919
What do you watch?

57
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,553
I don't know, atul'l'.

58
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,790
Well, like what?

59
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,028
Like Ice Road Truckers.

60
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,510
Ice Road Truckers.

61
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,193
What happens on that one?

62
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,394
Guya drive on Ice.

63
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,473
I am gonna do It.

64
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,108
You gotta inhale, by the way.

65
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,349
What the hell, man? Don't you have
enough cancer already? Look.

66
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,996


67
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,034
...I'd do It. I'll do It.

68
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,955
Yeah, well...

69
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,990
...what does it matter?

70
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,554
We're both dead men anyway.

71
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,995
-Hl.
-H|

72
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,429
Am I catching you at a bad time?

73
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,954
No. l have a few minutes.

74
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,354
So Mr.
l'm-Almoat-Slxteen-Leave-Me-Alone...

75
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:19,188
...doesn't want a big birthday,
just wants to hang out with friends...

76
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,152
-...whlch la fine by me. You?
-Flne by me.

77
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:27,592
Okay. So I figured a low-key family
dinner, no official party...

78
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,676
...and we bite the bullet...

79
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,399
...and buy him a car.

80
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,672
Used, l was thinking, would be best.

81
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,754
But no more than five years old.
Airbags, safety-rated, all that.

82
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,156
Do you have any thought:
on what kind?

83
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,954
Or should I just go ahead and--

84
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,839
Yeah. You just go ahead.

85
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,631
Okay.

86
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:57,470
Llsten, on another subject,
I just wanted to tell you...

87
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,596
...that business is good.

88
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,837
Really good.

89
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,074
So good that I'm thinking, maybe...

90
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,349
...you don't need to even work...

91
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,755
...your second job.

92
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,318
-You're turning a profit?
-We're comlng close.

93
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,838
Give us another month or two and,
yeah, we'll be there.

94
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,754
All of this to say...

95
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,952
...maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

96
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,795
I'm working on It.

97
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,752
Okay.

98
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,397
-Hello?
-Hey, buddy. Wake you?

99
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,032


100
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,834
Good. What you doing?

101
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,438
l'm....

102
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,438
Hey, llsten, I'll cut to It.
Another favour to ask.

103
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,638
I'm thinking about Gus Fring.
How he never goes anywhere.

104
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,912
One restaurant, home, back and forth?
I'm even more convinced it's bullshit...

105
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,509
...because he owns
13 other restaurants. nght?

106
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,677
So I start thinking
about this little empire of his.

107
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,555
Fourteen restaurants. Who supplies
them? What's the base of operations?

108
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,830
So I do a little digging, and bingo.

109
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,600
Pollos Hermanos
has a main distribution centre.

110
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,278
It's not far from town.

111
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:48,912
The place is huge. I mean...

112
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,597
...l'm looking at It onllne now.
It's a big warehouse...

113
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,355
...and rows
of these long, poultry bulldlngs...

114
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,629
...or hatcherles,
whatever you call them.

115
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,151
Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
Sounds promising, right?

116
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:09,351
So, what do you say, buddy?
Got another field trip in you?

117
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:15,032
You know, Hank, |'m-- |'m-- I'm--

118
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:18,948
I mean, It sounds great, It really does.
But I'm--

119
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,754
You know, I won't lle.

120
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,996
You've caught me somewhat...

121
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,634


122
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,754
What do you mean,
like taking-a-dump indisposed?

123
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,277
Yeah. That's embarrassing.

124
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,707
That's It.

125
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:41,754
You know, it's just upset stomach and,
you know, everything--

126
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,798
-Yeah.
-lt's out of control.

127
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,790
And It's really exploslve.
Bad Tex-Mex...

128
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,560
-...at the mall.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get It.

129
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,512
You don't have to paint a picture.

130
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,950
One guy In a diaper ls enough
for this trip.

131
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,548
-Yeah, and I'm sorry, Hank.
-Hey, don't be.

132
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,072
I've been asking a lot of you lately.
I appreciate it. I'll find another ride.

133
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,510
-Another rlde?
-Yeah.

134
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,320
I'm sure I can get someone else
to take me.

135
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,589
My tralner, Chuck.
Maybe I'll ask him.

136
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,792
Well, look, I'm--
ThIs Is probably just a 24-hour thlng.

137
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,950
Maybe 48 hours at the most.

138
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,677
And do you think you can possibly
hold off for a day or two?

139
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,195
Jeez, buddy, I mean, |....

140
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,277
You know, I just--
I would just really...

141
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,676
...love to be the one
to be able to take you there.

142
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,395
And, I mean, I've just really...

143
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:43,069
...enjoyed, you know,
the time with you...

144
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,158
-...and helping you and--
-Well, yeah.

145
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,351
Okay, sure.
If It means that much to you.

146
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,870
Just, you know, give me a call
when you're feeling up to it.

147
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:56,191
Thank you. I will. Okay.

148
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,798

My brother-in-law, my DE-- He....

153
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:34,192
Soon, he will probably,
In the near future...

154
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,391
...take a ride out
to a certain distribution centre...

155
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,599
...to look around for things.

156
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,199
Just...

157
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:47,754
...look around for things. And, yeah.

158
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,628

00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,707
...said you worked down here.
So I thought I'd come down and say hi.

175
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,909
Well...

176
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,117


177
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,754
You look great.

178
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,838
No. No, I don't.
I probably just look crazed.

179
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,116
Not at all. You look happy.

180
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,675
Last time I saw you....

181
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,712
HI, there.

182
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,671
I guess, Skyler...

183
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,913
...l'm gonna need to talk to you.

184
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,392
Ted, I really don't think
we have anything to talk about.

185
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,798
Actually, we do.

186
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,075
An audit?
Walt, an audit tomorrow?

187
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,512
-How long have you had this?
-A while.

188
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,871
| debated, you know, contacting you.

189
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,435
Contact me?
What about a lawyer, Ted?

190
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,432
Ted, thls ls....

191
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,471
This Is the CID.

192
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,234
The criminal division.

193
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:27,314
My God,
you're facing a felony charge here.

194
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,909
A $100,000 fine
on top of the taxes you already owe...

195
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,679
-...plus five years In prlson.
-Yeah.

196
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,153
-lt's bad.
-Yeah.

197
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:38,468
It most certainly ls.

198
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:43,512
Look, here's the thing.
I was wondering, maybe...

199
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:45,990
...if you could help with this.

200
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,757
Help?

201
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,791
Help how?

202
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:53,230
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books...

203
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,910
...got the way they are,
maybe there's some way...

204
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,508
...you could undo what's in there.

205
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,353
You want me to uncook your books?

206
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,917
Maybe there's some method or some
accounting trick you could use--

207
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,872
Ted, it doesn't work like that.

208
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,030
The damage is already--

209
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,511
My name.

210
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,032
My slgnatures...

211
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,673
...are all over those books.

212
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,389
Skyler, l'm accountable, not you.

213
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
Let me explain
what's going to happen here, okay?

214
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,193
Once the CID
sees this Is wllful tax fraud...

215
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,437
...they will build the strongest
possible case against you.

216
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:38,917
Once they start down that path, they
have an 80 percent conviction rate.

217
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,872
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail...

218
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,038
...and tap your phones,
and not just you, Ted...

219
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:49,311
...everyone involved in those books.

220
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,950
I can't have this in my life.

221
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,549
I cannot be audited.

222
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,155
Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

223
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,511
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

224
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,873
No offence.

225
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,992
I'm sorry. I....

226
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,351
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?

227
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,790
I'm going to figure out
a way through this, somehow. Okay?

228
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,349
Here.

229
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,238
So is he gonna kill him?

230
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,598
ls who gonna kill who?

231
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,472


232
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,592
Is he gonna kill Mr. Whlte's
brother-ln-law?

233
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,075
I mean, he's the reason
for all of this here, right?

234
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,034
Because it's totally logical for him
to off the dude.

235
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,438
A-hole DEA agent
poking around your junk.

236
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,428
Who needs that, right?

237
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,239
Makes sense to get rid of him
for good.

238
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,035
But killing a cop...

239
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,036
...I don't know.

240
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,714
It could look suspicious...

241
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,356
...if the dude who's investigating you
suddenly up and dies.

242
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,270
Then there's-- There's Mr. White...

243
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:08,147
...who would be even more apeshit
if he had family getting murdered.

244
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:14,758
He'd never cook for Gus again.

245
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:24,510
Guess there's a lot of angles
to consider.

246
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,755
If something were to happen to him,
would you have a problem with that?

247
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,954
Who really cares what I think?

248
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,311
Son of a bitch.

249
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:39,515
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

250
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,758
Hey.

251
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,949
Get down!

252
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,311
Tell them...

253
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:02,995
...the answer Is 'yes.'

254
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,838
-Should I even ask?
-I wouldn't.

255
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:48,428
So, what? Is this going to be
a regular thing now?

256
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,999
Meth cooking and corpse dlsposal?
Jesus.

257
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,755
Just grab us a spare barrel,
Walter.

258
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,312
What was it this time?

259
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,268
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

260
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,516
Or did Gus need to send
another message?

261
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,914
Shut your mouth.

262
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,834
You shut your mouth
or I'll shut It for you.

263
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,113
I don't want you talking to me
or Jesse. Just get the barrel.

264
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:16,874
And if you ever plan on calling the cops
on one of my guys again...

265
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,193
lee...

266
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,557
...I guess I never thanked you for
what you did.

267
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,548
Thanks.

268
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,034
Next time don't stand there
like an ldlot.

269
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:16,197
Move your feet.
Running and so forth.

270
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,791
But seriously, what--?

271
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,548
-What was the deal with Gus?
-The deal?

272
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,670
That Terminator shit.
Walking right into the bullets.

273
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,830
What the hell was he doing?

274
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,396
The cartel needs Gus.

275
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,319
His distribution network.
They're not looking to kill him.

276
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,837
But, what? The rest of us are like
open season?

277
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,270
Is he doing anything about that,
or do we keep hanging out...

278
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,835
-...for target practlse while he--?
-Kld.

279
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,874
Enough. You got questions,
ask him yourself.

280
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,233
And here again.

281
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,951
Unreported income.

282
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,399
That's more than a year straight so far.

283
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:12,031
You want to say something about this?
I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

284
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,195
I'd have to...

285
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,917
...have a look at the copies of
the receipts to refresh my memory.

286
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,907
Take all the time you need,
Mr. Beneke. That's why we're here.

287
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,358
Oh, lam so sorry I am late.

288
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,477
I got lost. Hey, Ted.

289
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,713
-Sky.
-Thls bulldlng ls so confuslng.

290
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,792
There are doors everywhere.

291
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,037
-Hl. You are...?
-Speclal Agent James Bekarls.

292
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,316
"Special." Skyler White.

293
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,559
Ms. Whlte,
you are the accountant of record...

294
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,148
...for many of these reports,
Is that correct?

295
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,596
-Gullty as charged.
-Can you shed light...

296
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,869
...on this history
of missing revenue?

297
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,310
Missing? No, it's there.

298
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,551
No. Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company...

299
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,718
...but It's not all accounted for
In your reports.

300
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,636
Let's take a look.

301
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,669
Oh, well, you know...

302
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,997
...thls account here,
that Is Mr. Keller's account.

303
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,713
And Mr. Keller Is an old friend
of Ted's dad.

304
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,149
He always sends
an electronic payment...

305
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,954
...whlch I hate,
because I'm a real-paper person.

306
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,707
Mr. Keller Is
one of those environmental people.

307
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,989
Since there wasn't a physical cheque...

308
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,829
...I didn't enter it into the book.
But the money is there.

309
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,917
Ms. Whlte, you've read Section 61
of the IRC?

310
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,917
I did not follow what you just said.

311
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,712
How gross income for a business is
defined, you're not allowed to do that.

312
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:50,069
-Well, lthlnk I am.
-No, you're not.

313
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,319
Well, you know what they say about
opinions, right? Everyone's got one.

314
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,073
But seriously, I am.

315
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,749
It doesn't matter if it's an
electronic cheque or a paper cheque...

316
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,952
...income is income.
You're not allowed to not declare it.

317
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,832
When I Input everything
Into the Quicken...

318
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,999
...nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?

319
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,514
Quicken.

320
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:18,352
You used Quicken to manage books
for a business this size.

321
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,632
I did. Do you guys use that here?
Because it is the best.

322
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,230
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

323
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,193
-Ms. White, how did you get this job?
-Ted hired me.

324
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,549
No, I mean your qualifications.

325
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,035
What are your qualifications?
Where did you get your training?

326
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,114
Well, I haven't had any training,
per se.

327
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,635
I've always been naturally good
with numbers.

328
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,116
Got a good lnstlnct for them.
nght, Teddy?

329
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,748
nght.

330
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,273
This is all falling into place now.

331
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,314
Ms. White, | just have to ask.
You're not managing accounts...

332
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,956
-...anywhere else, are you?
-nght now? No.

333
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,629
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

334
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,795
I'm not really clear about what
happened in there.

335
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:14,116
What happened was good news.
Ignorance of the law...

336
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,869
...doesn't equate to criminality.
It equates to ignorance.

337
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,230
Pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties...

338
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,953
...and move on from this.
Just put It behind you.

339
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,751
Pay with what?

340
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,315
I owe them $617,000. What am |--?

341
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,353
Look, just figure it out, all right?
And you've just dodged prison.

342
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,394
Sell your assets. Get rid of the BMW,
take out a second mortgage--

343
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,795
Second mortgage?
l have a lien on my house.

344
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,991
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets left to sell.

345
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:44,635
Ted, if you don't pay them,
they will reopen the investigation...

346
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:49,111
...and that little fiction | just spun up
there is gonna completely unravel.

347
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,037
You have to settle.

348
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,833
Wish I could.

349
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,313
Come In.

350
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,556
I hope you brought an appetite.

351
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,955
Yeah, I guess.

352
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,079
Mlke mentioned you have
some questions.

353
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:14,868
Yeah.

354
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,556
We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.

355
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,359
Right on.

356
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:53,836
I know you have concerns.

357
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,436
What happened yesterday,
to my man at the farm...

358
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,470
...it was a terrible thing.

359
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,752
The dude getting his head
blown off? Yeah.

360
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,469
l've invited you into my home...

361
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,628
...prepared food
so we could sit and talk.

362
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,639
Dlscuss what's going on In
this business...

363
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:20,759
...our business, like men.

364
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,596
And I will explain everything
that is happening.

365
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,876
I will answer your questions.

366
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,518
But first...

367
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,914
...I need you
to answer one question for me.

368
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:38,429
Can you cook Walter's formula?

369
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,508
What?

370
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,311
Walter's formula.

371
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,633
Can you produce his product
without any help? Alone.

372
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,028


373
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,268
Why?

374
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,072
You're asking me If I can cook
Mr. Whlte's crystal?

375
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,711
Without him?

376
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,469
Me?

377
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,191
The junkie loser you were about to waste
and dump in the desert a month ago.

378
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,277
Thls your plan?

379
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,189
lnvlte me In your house,
make whatever this Is...

380
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,917
...be my buddy...

381
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,194
...and make me feel important.

382
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:29,349
Then get me to keep cooking for you
after you kill Mr. White?

383
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,828
You wanna--
You wanna talk like men?

384
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:39,637
Let's talk like men. You kill Mr. White,
you're gonna have to kill me too.

385
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,395
That is not what I asked you.

386
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,751
You are here because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

387
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,271
And I need your help.

388
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,155
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

389
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,071
Now, If you would...

390
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,397
...answer the question.

391
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,275
Hey, you headed out?

392
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,479
Yeah.

393
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,797
Yo, Mr. White, hey. IreaIIy gotta

394
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,550
...wlth your famlly or whatever,
but thls Is Important...

395
00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:01,229
...so I'm hoping you could come over.

396
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,954
Thank God. Come on in.

397
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,671
-You-- You want a beer or something?
-No.

398
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:21,628
-Should I sit down?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, go ahead.

399
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,438
Okay, so....

400
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,918
Okay, so word has come down
that they--

401
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,873
They want me to go to Mexico.

402
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,951
There's some--
Some sort of war brewlng...

403
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,630
-...between Gus and the cartel.
-"Word has come down"?

404
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,355
The cartel has been--
Has been messing with Gus' operation.

405
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:46,119
lee jacklng trucks to,
like, send a message.

406
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,158
And yesterday,
that dude we brought to the lab.

407
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:53,717
I mean, they shot him right in
front of me. Just blew his head open.

408
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,357
Some snlper nalled him from
like a mile away.

409
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:01,637
Anyway, they've been holding
them off.

410
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,149
But between the cartel
taklng potshots...

411
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,035
...and your brother-in-law trying to throw
a net over the whole deal...

412
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,868
...it's like what you call
a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.

413
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,515
So, Gus is-- Is gonna cave.

414
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,029
So the cartel wants half
of Gus' entire operation...

415
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,629
...and they want your formula.
And he's gonna give it to them.

416
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:28,669
Well, |-- I gotta give it to them.
I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico...

417
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,357
...and teach a bunch of cartel chemists
how to cook a batch of blue.

418
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,470
You know,
and Gus doesn't trust you...

419
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,438
...so I gotta go.
I mean, you're the chemist, man...

420
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,030
...you know, not me.
I mean, let's say I go down to--

421
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,108
You know, go over there.
Go to the jungle or whatever...

422
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,668
...and they got like actual chemists...

423
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,792
...llke cartel chemlsts asking me
chemlstry stuff...

424
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:55,911
...that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you.

425
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,238
And what if all the equipment
is in Mexican instead of English?

426
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,515
You know?
I don't know. I don't know.

427
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,669
...l'm dead, you know? All of us.

428
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:18,073
Mr. White, look, I need--
I need your help.

429
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,193
Okay, maybe you could--
Maybe you could coach me...

430
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,991
...or something, you know.
Or give me some notes.

431
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,152
Mr. White?

432
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,951
So you saw Gus?

433
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:34,718
What? No.

434
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,839
-You didn't see Gus.
-No.

435
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,475
Then who told you all of that?

436
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,667
It was passed down, like I said.

437
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,388
"Passed down." By whom?

438
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,077
By.... By Mike and them.

439
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:55,431
-I mean, they did. They--
-So "they" doesn't include Gus.

440
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,311
You haven't been with Gus. You haven't
seen Gus. You haven't spoken to Gus.

441
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,677
-Why are you--?
-You weren't at Gus' house last night.

442
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,955
What?

443
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,753
What the hell? Jesus.

444
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,918
Still here.

445
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:24,033
You look me In the eye
and you tell me...

446
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,151
...that you weren't at his house
last night.

447
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,112


448
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,792
Look, I didn't have a chance,
all right?

449
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,714
Okay? I knew you would react
this way.

450
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,957
I knew you would freak out
and wouldn't believe me.

451
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,474
That's why I didn't say anything.

452
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,913
Look, there was just this one
big pot of stew.

453
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,873
He just made this one big pot
and we both ate from it.

454
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,513
What was I supposed to do,
polson myself?

455
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:55,638
Two hours, 18 minutes, and you couldn't
figure out a way to give it to him?

456
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,717
-He never left the room.
-You lylng llttle shltl

457
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,354
You had one thing to do, one thing.

458
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,955
That is the only thing, I might add,
that would save our lives...

459
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,993
...and you were right there.
You were In his house...

460
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,872
...and you didn't have the guts
to do It.

461
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,992
Two hours and 18 minutes?

462
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,236
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

463
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:23,397
How did you know
I was at his house last night?

464
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,153
Were you following me?

465
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,791
This. This is howl knew.

466
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,712
-You bugged my car?
-7:10 to 9:28 pm.

467
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:46,308
Not the slightest intention.

468
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:49,267
Everything that l have done for you.

469
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,914
You put a bug on my car?

470
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,588
I'm sorry,
after everything you've done for me?

471
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,710
What you've done for me?

472
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,036
You killed me, is what you've done!

473
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:03,631
You've signed my death warrant! Now
you want advice? I'll give you advice:

474
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,675
Go to Mexico and screw up like I know
you will. Wind up in a barrel somewhere!

475
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,951
You son of a--

476
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,712
Can you walk?

477
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,554
Yeah.

478
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:06,237
Then get the fuck out of here
and never come back.
