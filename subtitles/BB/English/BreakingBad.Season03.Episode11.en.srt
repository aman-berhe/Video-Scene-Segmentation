00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:09,708
In other worda,
Danny can be truated completely.

496
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,555
Now, whlle I agree wlth you
that laaer tag la a hard aell...

497
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,349
...wlthout a Danny,
the car waah lan't really an optlon.

498
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,593
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car waah?

499
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,356
Eaaler aald than done.

500
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,671
If we're looklng
for aomeone truatworthy.

501
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,628
What about me?

502
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,277
What about you?

503
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,793


504
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,588
I'll be the Danny.

505
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,070
No. No, no, Skyler,
that la not a good Idea.

506
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,435
I'm capable of managlng
a amall bualneaa.

507
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,192
A legal bualneaa, not thla.

508
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,759
Who elae could we truat?

509
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,875
-No.
-Walt...

510
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:28,678
...l'm In thla.

511
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,718
-And If I'm In It, I'm gonna do It rlght.
-No.

512
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,714
-You are not In thla. You are not--
-We're marrled, how am I not In thla?

513
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,269
We are not marrled, Skyler,
we're dlvorced.

514
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,559
nght?

515
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,394
I never actually got around
to flllng the papera.

516
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,357
Marrled couplea can't be compelled
to teatlfy agalnat one another.

517
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,590
So there'a that.

518
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,396
Jeaae. Jeaae.

519
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,713

Yea, all rlght. Okay.

Yeah, I'll be there.

524
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,432
What waa that?

525
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,349
An lnvltatlon.

526
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,036

527
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,270

I hope you llke palla marlna.

529
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,553
lt'a a fancy name for flah atew.

530
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,351
It aounda llke a cllche, but Indeed,
lt'a Juat llke my mother uaed to make It.

531
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,029
Come on. You can help me cook.

532
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,918
Thla la a Chllean dlah that I love...

533
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,469
...but I never get to make It.

534
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,717
Klda won't eat It.

535
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,357
But...

536
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,831
...you know how that la.

537
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,553
Sure.

538
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,633
Do you mlnd?

539
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:41,192
Would you allce the garllc?

540
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,837
Very thln.

541
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,753
Why dld you lnvlte me here?

542
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,151
We're worklng together...

543
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,550
...why not break bread together?

544
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,874
Now, the garllc?

545
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,035
It alwaya amazea me the way the
aenaea work In connectlon to memory.

546
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,397
I mean, thla atew la almply
an amalgam of lngredlenta.

547
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,234
Taken aeparately, theae lngredlenta
alone don't remlnd me of anythlng.

548
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,469
I mean, not very much at all.

549
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,838
But In thla preclae comblnatlon,
the amell of thla meal...

550
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,197
...lnatantly, It brlnga you back
to my chlldhood.

551
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,587
How la that poaalble?

552
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,074
Baalcally, It takea place
In the hlppocampua.

553
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,839
Neural connectlona are formed.

554
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,356
The aenaea make the neurona
expreaa algnala...

555
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,355
...that go rlght back to the aame part
of the braln aa before.

556
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,709
Where memory la atored.

557
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:11,227
lt'a aomethlng called
relatlonal memory.

558
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,636
Don't quote me on that, I'm....

559
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,553
I'm ruaty on my blology.

560
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,915

...It can overwhelm.

You are a wealthy man now.

570
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,434
And one muat learn to be rlch.

571
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,796
To be poor, anyone can manage.

572
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,511
What advlce do you have for me?

573
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,678
