1
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:04,998
In closing, I can tell you...

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,318
...we take this very seriously.
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,590
stopplng the nlo
of methamphetamlnu...

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,676
...remaln: one of
our hlghut prlorltlu.

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:17,667
The theft of lab equipment from your
school is also receiving our attention.

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,677
Rest assured,
no stone will go unturned...

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,792
...in our search for the person
or persons responsible for this.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,719
If you have any questions,
now would be the time. Sir.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,878
You're talking like
you haven't caught anybody yet.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,236
What about the janitor
dealing drugs at school?

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,909
There is no indication
that this individual was selling drugs.

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,758
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana...

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,190
...in his car, not in the school.

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,071
And he's since been fired.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,034
He had a record. I'd like to know
how he got a job here in the first place.

16
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,837
Why wasn't there
a background check?

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,192
There was one. We're currently
reviewing our hiring policies.

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,709
You better be doing more. This guy
was arrested in front of my daughter.

19
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,910
This guy was stealing
lab equipment, right?

20
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,030
That's not our thinking this time.

21
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,356
We're looking at others, but not
limited to the maintenance staff.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,632
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know when this happened?

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,149
I mean, could It have been
during school hours?

24
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,510
We haven't been able to establish
a date or time. There is no sign...

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,947
...of breaking or entering.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,390
So whoever took it had a key.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,717
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,833
Sir, at this time I'm not able to discuss
details with you. What I can tell you...

29
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,428
...is we have good people
working hard on this case.

30
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,477
I'm sorry, officer,
but that just sounds like double talk.

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,148
We're trying to protect our children.
Level with us.

32
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,317
Really, we're giving you
all the information we have.

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,239
You know what I'd like to see
in school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,115
Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors and
locker searches and strip-searches.

35
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,948
-Our district has strict policies--
-I heard about this school in Canada...

36
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,720
...they arrested one
of the groundskeepers with drugs...

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,356
...and the next day they found out over
half the students were high on LSD.

38
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,153
LSD? When were you gonna tell us
about the LSD?

39
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,796
No, please.
No one said anything about LSD.

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,912
What about the equipment
that's stolen?

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,430
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry-department locker.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,790
And tonight we're lucky
to have someone here...

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,956
...to give us some specifics.

44
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,639
Walt?

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,355
Yeah.

46
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:22,438
Mr. White
|s currently on medical leave.

47
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,715
But as he's chair
of the science department...

48
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,956
...he's made a very special effort
to be with us here.

49
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,788
And I'd like to take a moment
to thank him for that.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,358
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

51
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,789
-Please.
-Yes.

52
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,512
Sorry.

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,795
And thank you.

54
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,597
The inventory list
for the missing lab-wear is as follows:

55
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:02,754
One 5000 mlllllltre
round-bottom bolting ﬂask.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,351
One Kjeldahl-style recovery ﬂask,
800 millilitres.

57
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:10,278
Two full-face respirators.

58
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,108
Some CEP funnels, some head
with a thermometer holder.

59
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,230
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay.

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,388
Where did that come from?
And why was it so damn good?

61
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,028
Because it was illegal.

62
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,232
The basement.
Unfinished, of course.

63
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,116
But just look at all this space.
You gotta think rec room, media room.

64
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,238
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

65
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,949
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neighbourhood.

66
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,391
Big lawns and shade trees,
walking distance to the country club.

67
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,990
What happened there?

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,072
Bit of a fixer,
but this house has great bones.

69
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,828
Know what? We're zeroing in. I've got
another listing, new, around the corner.

70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,229
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,749


72
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,987
-lt's by appointment only.
-Oh, well, I'm here to see the owner.

73
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,389
He's in the recreational vehicle.

74
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,510
Yo, it's appointment only.

75
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,831
How are you feeling?

76
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,752
About as good as you look.
Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.

77
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,793
Listen, lvisited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

78
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,076
Yeah, Skinny Pete
said you wanted Tuco's address.

79
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,794
Acting like you're all out for blood.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,390
But you are alive.
Obviously you wised up.

81
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,194
-No, I did go see him.
-Bullshlt.

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,233
-So, what, are you selling your house?
-I got two dudes...

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,398
...that turned into raspberry slushy
and flushed down my toilet.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,875
I can't even
take a proper dump In there.

85
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:06,310
I mean, the whole damn house
has gotta be haunted by now.

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,674
You didn't actually go see Tuco.

87
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,193
Here.

88
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,077
That Is 17,500.
Your half of the 35,000.

89
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,478
Plus, there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours. You've earned it.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,109
-You got this money from Tuco?
-Yeah.

91
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,072
So Tuco gave you this,
Is what you're saying.

92
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,235
Well, we made a deal.

93
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,749
-You made a deal?
-That's right.

94
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,917
How--? Why would you
make a deal with that scumbag?

95
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,270
-You see what he did to me?
-Because I think...

96
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,949
...that we can do business together.
We came to an understanding.

97
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,315
No way, man.
Okay? No understanding.

98
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,437
Take a look
at the money In your hand.

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,030
Now, just Imagine
making that every week.

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,671
That's right.
Two pounds a week, 35,000 a pound.

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,756
Without even talking to me
you told this insane ass-clown...

102
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,156
...dead-eyed killer that--

103
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,112
That we would
give him 2 pounds a week.

104
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:09,873
We'll just scale up our operation,
add a few more hours.

105
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,592
No, don't talk to me about hours.

106
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:14,916
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

107
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:18,714
You think the meth falry's
just gonna brlng It to us?

108
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,194
God, It takes me a week
to get this stuff.

109
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,351
I'm driving
all the way to Las Cruces...

110
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,432
...200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs.

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,478
-Smurts?
-The dudes who go to the drugstores...

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,433
...and get a couple boxes at a time
and then sell them to me.

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,399
That's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

114
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,473
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

115
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,635
All right.

116
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,076
Of course, you would've known
that if you would've just asked me.

117
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,428
-Well, here we are again.
-Here we are.

118
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,197
-Skyler, you look great.
-Thank you.

119
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,630
You must be, what, six, seven months?

120
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,635
Other than waddling
to the bathroom every five minutes.

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,918
The baby shower is next week.

122
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,076
And It'll be good to....

123
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,670
It'll be good to have a day
that's just about Skyler.

124
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,716
Very nice.

125
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,070
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

126
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,909
-Walt, I see you committed to hair loss.
-Yeah.

127
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,315
-How do you feel?
-Okay.

128
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,712
I-- You know, pretty decent, actually.

129
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,031
His colour |s better.
You know, his energy.

130
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,558
And he's even more physical.

131
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,198
More physical?

132
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,357
Well, sexual.

133
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,314
Frisky, actually. I mean,
that's gotta be a good sign, right?

134
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,518
-Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?
-nght.

135
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:47,074
Couldn't that mean
that the chemo |s working?

136
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,113
Well, realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the antiemetics tuned right.

137
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,113
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo...

138
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,436
...and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

139
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,074
Well, isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

140
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,237
I've been wondering
about alternative medicine.

141
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,671
I mean, Eastern healing.

142
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,873
-You know, hollstlc.
-Well, I can't speak to Its efficacy...

143
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,799
...but as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment...

144
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,792
...anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook...

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,549
...a better comfort, is fine by me.

146
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,833
So you're saying
It's just all psychological.

147
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,155
It doesn't make any real difference.

148
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,789
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

149
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,912
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

150
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,957
What?

151
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:04,670
A junkyard?
Let me guess, you picked this place?

152
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,473
What's wrong with it? It's private.

153
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,832
This Is like a non-criminal's
Idea of a drug meet.

154
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,640
This Is, 'Oh, I saw this In a movie.
Look at me.'

155
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,434
Yes. So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

156
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,279
I don't know,
how about Taco Cabeza?

157
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,278
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

158
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,678
Nice and public. Open 24 hours.

159
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,156
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

160
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,238
Hell, why not the mall?

161
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,670
You know, wait at the Gap.
Hey, it's time for the meet.

162
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,518
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakls...

163
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,869
...head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

164
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,516
Skip the part where
psycho-lunatic Tuco, you know...

165
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:52,268
...comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

166
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,758
Look, you don't
have to be here for this.

167
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,757
Okay? I mean, seriously.

168
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,631
I'm okay.

169
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,638
No. I'm no pussy.

170
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,076


171
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,230
Mr. Clean and his boy.

172
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,195
Now, I'm sorry
that I had to tune you up.

173
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,471
Respect, ese,
you gotta give It to get It.

174
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,395
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

175
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,193
What, they close the mall
or something?

176
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,115
Heisenberg, come on, break it out.

177
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:00,875
-That's it? That's all you got?
-We had some production problems.

178
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,116


179
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,478
I thought you was a player.

180
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,468
You told me 2 pounds...

181
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,956
...and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

182
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,670
Seventeen and a half.
Minus the half for wasting my time.

183
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,195
-Hey, come on.
-What, you gonna argue?

184
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,708
You got something to say?

185
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:37,309
You're doing business
like a couple llttle bitches.

186
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,631
I want all of It.

187
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,271
Seventy grand.

188
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,789
-What did you say?
-You like this product.

189
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,799
And you want more.

190
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,797
Consider it a capital investment.

191
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,839
Look, old, bald motherfucker.

192
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,954
Fifty-two and a half, 25 points vig.

193
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,437
Vlg?

194
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,557
Interest, weekly.

195
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,109
Okay.

196
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,791
That's $65,625 with interest.

197
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,988
-1.075 pounds.
-No, 2 pounds.

198
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,431
Next Friday,
and no production problems.

199
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,952
Can you handle 4 pounds?

200
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,196
Listen, old man, talk is talk.

201
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:42,150
But owing me money, that's bad.

202
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,512
What did you just do?

203
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,275
Four pounds. Four pounds.
Two pounds wasn't bad enough.

204
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,359
We're talking 2, 300 boxes
of sinus pllls.

205
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,436
There ain't that many smurfs
In the world.

206
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,517
We're not gonna need
pseudoephedrlne.

207
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,439
We're gonna make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace.

208
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,713
We're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

209
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,519
-So no pseudo?
-No pseudo.

210
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,391
So you do have a plan.

211
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,750
Yeah, Mr. White.

212
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,278
Yeah, sclence.

213
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,838
Okay.

214
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,117
-What's this?
-That Is a shopping list.

215
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,632
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

216
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,031
One autotransformer...

217
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,553
...6 litres anhydrous methenamine.

218
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,792
-Two 35 M and M tube furnaces.
-It's mm, millimetre.

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,992
One 70 millimetre would be fine,
but they're hard to come by.

220
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,350
Forty grams thorium nitrate.

221
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,154
Yo, Mr. White,
I can't even pronounce half this shit.

222
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,957
No. Count me out. All right?

223
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:16,514
I'm leaving town.
I'm moving to Oregon or something.

224
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:19,233
-Thls |s just--
-Jesse, Jesse, Jesse. Listen to me.

225
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,468
Today Is the first day
of the rest of your life.

226
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,432
-What are you doing?
-The first day of the rest of your life.

227
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,153
But what kind of life will it be?

228
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,035
Will It be a life of fear,
of 'Oh, no, no, no. I can't do this.‘

229
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,993
Of never once believing in yourself?

230
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,475
-I don't know.
-Llsten.

231
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,558
These things?
We need them, all right?

232
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,320
And only you can get them for us.

233
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,879
Okay, it's ready. Here you go.

234
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,551
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.

235
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,593
Of course you already know that
because when you watch this...

236
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,871
...20 years from now, I will look
exactly the same as I do now.

237
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,393
I know, it is amazing.
I have aged shockingly well. Haven't I?

238
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:16,753
Anyway, welcome to your baby shower,
Esmeralda.

239
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,598
-Esmeralda?
-Esmeralda.

240
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,916
That's your name
and you heard it here first.

241
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:26,351
Now, that is your wonderful,
handsome older brother.

242
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,198
Show her, older brother, your face.

243
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:34,392
Okay, not right up the nose. Don't--
Okay, not up it. Back. Back to me.

244
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:39,195
Here's your mommy. Hello, Mom.

245
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,550
-And look, there you are, Esmeralda.
-Yeah.

246
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,995
-Wake up, baby. Time to party.
-Easy, easy. Believe it or not...

247
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,068
...Esmeralda, right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

248
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,429
And i believe, Hank,
that was around the time...

249
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,551
...we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

250
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
i dropped her off at the kerb.

251
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:04,998
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

252
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,718
There's Daddy. Speak, Daddy.
Say hello to your daughter.

253
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,673
Holly, I am very proud ofyou.

254
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:25,077
And l....
i think about you all the time.

255
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,835
Wherever you go,
whatever you do in life...

256
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,636
...always know that you have a family
who loves you very, very much.

257
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,709
-cheers.
-cheers.

258
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,397
Oh, my God, It's so cute.
Oh, Carmen. It's--

259
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,751
Oh, look. Look at that. It's adorable.

260
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:56,156
-I love It, Carmen. Thank you.
-You're so welcome, honey.

261
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,432
Thank you.
Look at the little feet.

262
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,715
-Okay.
-From me. And Hank.

263
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,113
What nice wrapping paper.

264
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,356
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

265
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,311
-I do.
-Okay.

266
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,274
Let's see. And....

267
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,674
Excltlng.

268
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,195
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

269
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:31,996
-lt's-- It's a-- A tlara.
-Yes.

270
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,189
Marie, Is this--?

271
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:40,028
White gold and several carats
worth of zircons.

272
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,594
Oh, Marie.
You spent too much on this.

273
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,836
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

274
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,827
But it's so-- It's really-- It's....

275
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,075
It's sparkly.

276
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,271
-Sparkly.
-I know.

277
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,233
-Thank you.
-Hey, llsten, Walt.

278
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,111
You got anything
stronger than beer?

279
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,993
-lt's-- It's great. I love It.
-Yeah.

280
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,352
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetle, thank you.

281
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,754
Sorry, man. It's just, you know, after
200 presents, it just gets kind of old.

282
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,954
-lt's nice stuff.
-It Is, Isn't It?

283
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,234
I got just the thing to go with that.

284
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,398
-l'm sorry, man, lwasn't thinking.
-No, no, no. It's okay.

285
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,393
You mind if I have one?

286
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,830
-You think that's a good idea?
-Hank, I've already got lung cancer.

287
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,951
Okay. You got me there.

288
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,078
Thanks.

289
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,551
Cuban.

290
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,356
I did a little favour for an FBI guy.

291
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:02,992
Now, I was under the impression...

292
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,509
...that these were illegal.

293
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,350
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit
tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?

294
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,158
It's funny, Isn't It?
How we draw that line.

295
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,873
Yeah.

296
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,149
What line is that?

297
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:31,593
Well, what's legal, what's illegal.
You know, Cuban cigars, alcohol.

298
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:37,271
You know, if we were drinking this
in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.

299
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,552
Another year, we'd be okay.

300
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,388
Who knows
what will be legal next year.

301
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,518
You mean like pot?

302
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,110
Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.

303
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,035
Cocaine? Heroin?

304
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,594
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

305
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,151
Well, you ought to visit lockup.
You hear a lot of guys talking like that.

306
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,830
"Hey, man, what, you busting me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

307
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,430
It's all going to be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

308
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:18,958
Say It, buddy.

309
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,115
It don't only go one way either.

310
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,517
I mean, some other stuff is legal
that shouldn't be.

311
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:28,792
I mean,
frigging meth used to be legal.

312
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:33,151
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

313
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,557
Thank God they came to their senses
on that one, huh?

314
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,631
Yeah.

315
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,948
Okay.

316
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,155
Nlce party.

317
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,348
A tlara.

318
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,996
A white-gold tlara
for a newborn baby.

319
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,149
Yeah. You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill.

320
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:16,390
I mean, that thing must've cost,
like, what, 5 or 600 dollars.

321
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,268
You know, I think I'm gonna return it.

322
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,948
Are you sure?
She's bound to find out.

323
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,038
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie...

324
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:32,915
...more than a white-gold baby tiara.

325
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,837
Hey. You know, I've been thinking...

326
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,191
...about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli
about alternative medicine.

327
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,755
No. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna mention that anymore.

328
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:47,157
No, no, no. What I mean is that
maybe there is something to it.

329
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,635
Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

330
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,548
Healing ceremony. It's supposed
to be good for your lungs.

331
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,989
I'm not saying that I believe in it...

332
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,438
...but it might be an experience.

333
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,231
Really.

334
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,118
You?

335
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,514
In a sweat lodge.

336
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,631
I was thinking about driving up
on Friday, coming back Sunday.

337
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,628
-I mean, if you're okay with it.
-Well, of course I'm okay with that.

338
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,319
Okay.

339
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,871
-Sweat lodge?
-Yeah.

340
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,435
I'm already sweating. Help me out.

341
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,274
Okay.

342
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,232
Hey.

343
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,237
70 millimetre tube furnace. Excellent.

344
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,556
-Thls |s excellent. Good work.
-Damn straight.

345
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,557
Okay, hydrogen.
Electrolytically produced, yes?

346
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,556
Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this--

347
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,115
This crap wasn't easy to get.
And It's expensive.

348
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,991
Methylamlne.
Where's the methylamlne?

349
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,792
I don't see the methylamine.

350
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:01,753
Yeah, well,
that's where I ran Into some trouble.

351
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,279
What kind of trouble?

352
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,550
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

353
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,751
But this methylamine....

354
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,197
Not so easy.
I mean, they got it locked down tight.

355
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:15,436
But I did find some pros
who will rip It off for us.

356
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:18,358
But they want 10 grand.

357
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,278
What's the problem?
You have the money.

358
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,914
No, had.
I spent almost the whole wad.

359
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,158
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

360
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,149
So these thieves, did they say
where they would be stealing it from?

361
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,954
A chemical supply place,
south of town.

362
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,038
They got guards and security cameras.
They got steel doors.

363
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:41,436
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

364
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,198
What?

365
00:24:56,239 --> 00:25:00,118
So why don't we
just steal It ourselves?

366
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,913
Yeah?

367
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,155
How we gonna do that?

368
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,071
With this.

369
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:24,035
So, what's this stuff called again?

370
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,753
Thermlte.

371
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,075
And that will cut through a lock?

372
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,794
Because this Is supposed to be
one blg-ass lock.

373
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,388
In World War II...

374
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,388
...the Germans had an artillery piece--
It's the biggest in the world.

375
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,431
--called the Gustav Gun.

376
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,108
And it weighed a thousand tons.

377
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,438
And the Gustav
was capable of firing a 7-ton shell...

378
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:53,871
...and hitting a target,
accurately, 23 miles away.

379
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,999
I mean, you could drop bombs on it
every day for a month...

380
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,509
...without ever disabling it.

381
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,393
But...

382
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,431
...drop a commando...

383
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:09,632
...one man, with just a bag of this...

384
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,592
...and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel...

385
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,915
...and destroy that gun forever.

386
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,676
Jeez.

387
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,276
So yes...

388
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,351
...I think it will cut through
any lock we're likely to find.

389
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:36,030
-You'd like to return this.
-lt's very nice, but yes.

390
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,309
Well, lt-- It Is from this store,
Isn't It?

391
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,079
Oh, yes, it's from this store.

392
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,315
Do you happen to have a receipt?

393
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,874
No, I don't. It was a gift.

394
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:47,708
A gift.

395
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,035
Mr. Wilson,
could you step over here, please?

396
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,875
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

397
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,834
Whoa, excuse me?

398
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,395

Please do.

402
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,112
We'll be here.

403
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,437
Look, In
I've never stolen anything In my life.

404
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,518
All right?
I told you, that tlara was a gift--

405
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:27,756
-A baby-shower glft.
-So who gave It to you, then?

406
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,270
-I don't have to tell you that.
-You don't have to tell me anything.

407
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,198
You can talk to the police.

408
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,595
I can tell them
my daughter-In-law remembers...

409
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,633
...showing this particular item
to a tall blond woman...

410
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,956
...who, when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

411
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,797
-So there.
-Oh, yeah?

412
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:49,787
Well, then, I can talk
to the Channel Three News.

Yeah, I can tell them
how you people, without a shred--

414
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,837
Without a modicum of evidence,
illegally detained...

415
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,271
...an innocent pregnant woman
in a dank storeroom.

416
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,075
-Thls Is my office.
-I feel I'm being held hostage.

417
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,749
Furthermore, I'm not
getting enough air back here.

418
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:11,433
I don't think--
I don't think I can breathe.

419
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:14,358

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,791
Where is the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

425
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,991
-Do you think he already passed?
-Look, I don't-- I don't know.

Okay, wait till he passes.

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,038
Okay, It's clear.

00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,068
Here.

431
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,149
-What the hell Is this?
-lt's all they had.

432
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,193
If this Is all they had,
you're In the wrong place.

433
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:06,627
Just put It on.

434
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,670
Should've-- Of course.

00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,990
Okay, okay.

436
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:20,357
Okay. This Is It.

437
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,630
Oh, God.

438
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,958
Okay.

Hey, Jimmy, I'm stopping....

00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,713
Oh, my God.

444
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,308
Hope everything comes out all right.

445
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,636
-He's going to the crapper.
-Oh, God.

00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,717
-Okay. You coming, man? Come on.

Okay, there It Is.

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,799
Is this gonna be loud?

449
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,467
You'll find out in about 10 seconds.

450
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,594
Stand back.

451
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:43,628
Jesus.

452
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,557
Come on, come on.

453
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:01,347
Hey, what's going on?

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,517

460
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,957
-How are we gonna take this thing out?
-Come on. Take that.

-Billy, you back from the crapper yet?
-Let me out of here.

465
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:42,427
-I'm gonna kick somebody's ass.
-The alarm's going off. Check it out.

466
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,391

467
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:46,795

00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,193

-Come on, let me try.

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,278
-Can ljust try It?
-Flne, go ahead.

471
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,710
Jesus. Okay.

472
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,828
All right.

473
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:20,308
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat It. Okay, I'm the king.

474
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,111
-Yeah, okay.
-l'm the king.

475
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:27,633
No. No, no. That didn't sound good.

476
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,993
Oh, God.

477
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:34,876
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

478
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,594
We're not cooking
in my damn driveway, I'll tell you that.

479
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,272


480
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,868
What part of "slow it down"
did you not understand?

481
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,959
What are you talking--? I'm--
It's heavy, man. It got away from me.

482
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,119
Okay. All right.
Now, that's good, that's good.

483
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,310
Nowjust bring it up, bring it up.

484
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,432
Easy, easy, easy. Okay.

485
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:03,956
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

486
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,515
Oh, shit.

487
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,995
Yeah. I don't know.

488
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,679
I'll make damn sure she doesn't.

489
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,550
Good call, yo.

490
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:50,713
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

491
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,309
We'll need to run it two more hours...

492
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,874
...to have enough to make
4.5 pounds.

493
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,071
Four and a half, not 4?

494
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,158
Two pounds pays, two go back.

495
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,673
Four and a half pounds
puts us $44,000 ahead.

496
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,677
-Each.
-R|ght on, man.

497
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,069
Right on.

498
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,917
...we can make
4.5 pounds a week for....

499
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,475
Well, for the foreseeable future.

500
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,116
How long is that gonna be?

501
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,277
I mean, in your situation.

502
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,788
How much cash do you need?

503
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,832
More.

504
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,031
Someone's in the yard.

505
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,111
Yeah, this is definitely the one.

506
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,548
It's pretty.

507
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,718
Actually, I like It.

508
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,831
We could pull that out
and put In a closet.

509
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,679
Just a little--
We'll have to bring that down.

510
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,509
I thought you didn't like
that type of thing.

511
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,279
Oh, no. No, I don't.

512
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,676
Right, right.

513
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,310
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon, an open house?

514
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,795
-I left her a message. It's not my fault.
-I don't care how you do it...

515
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:16,229
...just keep them out of here.
Do you understand?

516
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,111
-Yeah.
-All right, go.

517
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:40,836
Absolutely.

518
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,197
You know, you can't duck me forever.

519
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,593
What?

520
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,915
Come on, I left you, like,
15 messages.

521
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,474
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back.

522
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:57,432
I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch.

523
00:35:57,639 --> 00:35:59,550
Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid pollce?

524
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:03,877
You know what, Marie? Marie, I have
never been so humiliated in my life.

525
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,592
That--

526
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,278
That tlara.

527
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:15,828
What were you doing at Zachary's?

528
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,357
l was returning It.

529
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,315
You were returning it.

530
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,427
Why would you return it?

531
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,915
It just wasn't--

532
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,998
Marie, what is wrong with you?
Can you please tell me that?

533
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,157
Can you tell me
why you'd do such a thing?

534
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,309
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

535
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,349
That...means that I have no idea
what the hell you're even talking about.

536
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,437
You have no Idea
what I'm talking about.

537
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,119
The shop--

538
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:54,997
The shoplifting. No idea?

539
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,793
You're not going to admit this,
are you?

540
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,111
I can't really admit to something...

541
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:07,994
...when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

542
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,354
-Would you like that gift-wrapped?
-Yes, actually.

543
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,630
Don't forget to sign in.

544
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,678
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

545
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,472
You're right.

546
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:42,629
Look at this wall here.

547
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,954

548
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,232
-Yeah, well, It's occupled.
-lt's not a bathroom.

549
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:02,476
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

550
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,351
You ain't seeing the basement, bitch.

551
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,393
You got that? Is that slnklng In?
Now, beat It.

552
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,636
All you all, house is not for sale.

553
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,796
Get the hell out.

554
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,756
-Hey.
-Hey.

555
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,191
So how was It?

556
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,353
Was it an experience?

557
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,959
Yeah.

558
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,913
It was definitely an experience.

559
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,159
What's that smell?

560
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,115
Oh, yeah, It's...

561
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,879
...sacred Navajo herbs.

562
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,717
You know.

563
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:35,831
Hey, everything okay?

564
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,473


565
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,351
Not really.

566
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,870
Actually, not at all.

567
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:48,795
You know that tlara
that Marie gave us?

568
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:54,437
-Yeah.
-Well, she stole It. Yep.

569
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,428
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

570
00:39:58,799 --> 00:39:59,914
Oh, my God.

571
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,953
I mean, she refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologise.

572
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,116
I don't know what to do.

573
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,068
People sometimes
do things for their families.

574
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,555
People sometimes
do things for their families?

575
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:24,592
And what, that justifies stealing?

576
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,551
Well....

577
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:31,238
That must've been
some sweat lodge.

578
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:35,355
Are you even listening to the words
coming out of your mouth?

579
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:41,351
What would you do if it were me?

580
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,435
What do you mean, if it were you?

581
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,635
If it were me, what would you do?
Would you divorce me?

582
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,469
Would you turn me in to the police?

583
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,595
You don't want to find out.

584
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,471
You want something to eat?

585
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,910
No, thanks.

586
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:41,352
What is this shit? This is blue.

587
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,598
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

588
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,598
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

589
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,838
Tight, tight, tight, yeah.

590
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,750
Blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

591
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,596
4.6.

592
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,038
Come on.

593
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,191
And what'd I say, man?
This guy can cook.

594
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,231
You're all right, man. You're all right.

595
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,907
We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

596
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:30,712
Just remember
who you're working for.

597
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,879
What did you say?

598
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,953
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

599
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,555
Like they don't already know that?

600
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,279
Are you saying that they're stupid?

601
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,594
No, I'm just-- I'm just saying.

602
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,267
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid.

603
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:52,947
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

604
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,958
No, come on, Tuco. I'm just--
I'm just saying.

605
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,877
No, you're just speaking for me!

606
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,118
Like I ain't got the goddamn sense
to speak for myself!

607
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:05,591
Is that it? Is that what you're doing?

608
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:08,953
Tuco.

609
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:14,147
Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?

610
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,992
Heisenberg says "relax."

611
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,313
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

612
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,668
I'm relax--

613
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,754
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

614
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,831
That Is messed up.

615
00:43:58,279 --> 00:44:00,634
Okay, Heisenberg.

616
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,512
Next week.
