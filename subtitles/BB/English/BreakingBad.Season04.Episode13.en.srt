1
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,919
What did you say to Gus?

2
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,351
-Because he's on to us. Yeah.
-What do you mean he's on to us?

3
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,393
Ho's walklng to hl: car,
than suddenly he Isn't.

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,318
What, does he have a sixth sense?

5
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,157
Jesus. What did you say to him?

6
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,590
Could I ask my own question right now
at this point?

7
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,154
Did you Just bring a bomb
Into a hospital?

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,478
What, was I supposed to leave It
on his car?

9
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:27,273
What, you're supposed to bring It
to a hospital?

10
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,234
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,634
Look.

12
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,916
Where can we find Gus?

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,793
Name a place. One place
where I can surprise him...

14
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,308
...where he won't see me coming.

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,157
Because his house, the laundry...

16
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,351
...the restaurant, factory farm,
a|| wired with cameras.

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,391
One place.

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,268
Thlnk. Jesse, think.

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,277
Where is it? Where?

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,835
Because if you can't tell me...

21
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,836
...we are dead.

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,838
Jesse?

23
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,151
|don't-- I don't know.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,199
Well, maybe--

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,709
Excuse me. Jesse Pinkman?

26
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,833
-Yeah.
-Hl. Detective Kalanchoe.

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,196
Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Pollce.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,234
We were wondering if we could have
a few minutes. Go someplace and talk.

29
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,428
About what?

30
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,107
-Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
-About what?

31
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,911
It concerns Brock Cantillo...

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,270
...and a statement you made
to his mother.

33
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,958
How about you come with us?

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,038
We just wanna clear a few things up,
no big deal.

35
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,193
-So am I under arrest?
-No, you're not under arrest.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,469
We're Just talking.

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,558
So If I get tired of talking,
can I get up and leave?

38
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,955
We'd prefer you didn't.

39
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,593
-You'd prefer.
-Yeah.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,918
Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom
that the boy had been poisoned?

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,350
Look, lthlnk this has been,
you know...

42
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,870
...what do call it? Overblown.

43
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,797
Because all I basically said was:

44
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:42,958
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,991
In a cover-all-bases kind of sense.

46
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,078
Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that.
You helping them out like that.

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,077
Especially how specific you were.

48
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,110


49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,676
Ricin, that's definitely a big one.
You don't see that every day.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,952
So when doctors hear that,
they take it very seriously.

51
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,911
As do we.

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,953
-As does the FBI.
-0kay.

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,628
Nlce, you trying to help out
like that and all.

54
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:11,752
You know, professional courtesy,
sharing your expertise.

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,192
Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right?
ljust, you know--

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,550
You happened
to guess this rare polson...

57
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,796
...might be the thing
that put this boy in the hospital.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,073
Congratulations. Because his doctors,
they think that you might just be right.

59
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,397
So why rlcln?
Jesse, how'd you come up with that?

60
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:34,275
I think I've-- I don't know, I must've
saw it on House or something.

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,396
Yeah, you know, like, House
or the Discovery Channel.

62
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,352
Sometimes your brain
just makes these connections.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,278
-Does It?
-Mlne does.

64
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,113
That's Interesting.

65
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,708
Look, I gotta get back.

66
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,989
But we're still talking.

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,353
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,312
So then, I guess...

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,715
...I should call my lawyer, right?

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,718
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

71
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,513
Why can't we keep talking,
keep It llght?

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,075
You know how It Is
when the lawyers get to It.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,510
Suddenly,
everything's a big plsslng match.

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,711
-lee, every time.
-Adversarlal.

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,229
Adversarlal.
Then we gotta book you. nght?

76
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,193
I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

77
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,351
You're no Boy Scout.

78
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,152
Saul Goodman.

79
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,111
That's my guy.

80
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,629
So do I gotta call him or do you?

81
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,753
What the hell are you doing?

82
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,189
-I need Saul. Right now.
-So you break In?

83
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,629
-You just break In.
-I see you're here.

84
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,435
If you'd answer the phone or the door,
maybe I wouldn't-- Forget it.

85
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,154
Is be here?

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,954
Is that a serious question?
Why would he be here?

87
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,354
But you know where be ls.
I need a number.

88
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,149
Look, let me explain something
to you.

89
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,555
-My partner and l--
-Are In danger?

90
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,432
Whoopty-freakingdoo.
Why do you think he's not here?

91
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,268
And how's that news, exactly,
the two of you being in danger?

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,038
After doing something idiotic?

93
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,754
What gives you the right
to break down my door?

94
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,314
Look, ljust need a number, okay?
That's all.

95
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,069
You are such a pain In my ass,
you know that?

96
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,078
You're the reason
I gotta go on unemployment.

97
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,747
l was looking forward
to getting out of here.

98
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,474
But, no,
now I gotta wait around all day...

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,558
...for a guy to come fix this door.
Who pays for this?

100
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,750
Okay, you know what?

101
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,871
Here, look, I'm giving you everything.
All of It, okay?

102
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,114
There's one, two....

103
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,035
Look, there's gotta be at least
1700 dollars there, okay?

104
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:11,595
More than cover the cost of the door.
Now, I apologise profusely.

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,995
Please. The phone number.

106
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,437
A door like this Is gonna cost
way more than 1700.

107
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,835
What, for a plate of glass? No.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,235
Oh, yeah. I bet it does.

109
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,079
I bet you it winds up costing...

110
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,552


111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,994
Are you Insane?

112
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,671
Who the hell is going to charge
$20,000 for a plate-glass door?

113
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,313
There's no reputable vendor would--

114
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,594
Now I'm thinking 25.

115
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,753
I'll be right back.

116
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,193
Yes. Albuquerque, New Mexico.

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,395

306 Negra Arroyo Lane.

118
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:12,308
Would you connect It for me, please?
Thank you.

119
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:19,231
Becky, hi. lt's Walter White.

120
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,952
Listen, I wo--

121
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,515
I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?

122
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,990
Oh, good, good.

123
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,156
Yes, cats are....

124
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,475
Llsten.

125
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,557
Skyler and l are out of town,
on our way to Santa Fe...

126
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,877
...and Junlorjust told us
that he thinks...

127
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,390
...he may have left the burner on
on the stove.

128
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,876
Yes, God forbid, there's a fire.

129
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:47,955
Well, that's why I'm calling.
You se-- | just wanted to ask...

130
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,629
...and I'm sorry to do this,
but do you still have the key?

131
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,434
You do? Good.
And would you be willing to--?

132
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,315
Oh, you are a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.

133
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,874
Yes. Okay.

134
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,959
Okay. I'll await your call.
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

135
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,517
There you go.

136
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,752
Becky?

137
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,913
Oh, that's good. That's a relief.

138
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,637
I owe you one. Bigtime.

139
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,511
So how's he doing?

140
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,435
You could at least say, instead
of being a couple dicks about it.

141
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:12,357
Jesse, If you care at all
about that little boy...

142
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,436
...prove It to me.

143
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,312
Tell us what you know.

144
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,794
-I told you what I know.
-Tell us again.

145
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,913
What are you, like, broken records?

146
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,474
l was trying to be helpful.

147
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,477
End of story.

148
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,478
Guess we'll wait and see
what the tox screen says.

149
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,832
Look at this. Isn't this cosy?
What'd you tell them?

150
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,348
I told them they're a couple of dicks.

151
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,515
He's a wordsmith.

152
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,951
Well, detectives, it's been a pleasure.
Now, up you go...

153
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,947
...make like you got manners,
make like you respect the rule of law.

154
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,869
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,
hasta Iuego, get the hell out.

155
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,789
Bye-bye. That's It, plck It up.
Follow your partner.

156
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,592
And one-two.

157
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,392
Thank you.

158
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,511
Christ. You two--?

159
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:07,234
If I ever get anal polyps,
I'll know what to name them.

160
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,431
Are you gonna get me out of here?

161
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,078
No. Not even if I could.

162
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,555
You know, the FBl's gonna show up
on this ricin thing...

163
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,832
...and then you're In It
for the duration.

164
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,551
You're a lot safer in here.

165
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,149
They tried to get your partner
in his own home.

166
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,271
Jesus.

167
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,673
Is be okay?

168
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,350
Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.

169
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,913
Wanna go stick your wangs
In a hornet's nest...

170
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:43,317
...it's a free country. But how come
I always get sloppy seconds, huh?

171
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,952
You got anything for me? Tell me
I didn't poke my head up for nothing.

172
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:51,713
Yeah.

173
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,672
I've been thlnklng....

174
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,631
And?

175
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,549
Casa Tranqulla.

176
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,987
What's Casa Tranquila?

177
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,430
It's an old folks' home
off Paseo Del Norte.

178
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,791
Our boy tells me Fring took him
to visit one of the patients.

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,514
Someone Pinkman says
you'll definitely remember:

180
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,596
Tlo Salamanca.

181
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,435
Old guy in a wheelchair?

182
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,512
Doesn't talk, rings a bell.

183
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,597
I mean, does that ring a bell?

184
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,555
-The guy actually has to ring a bell.
-Yes, I know. I remember.

185
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,915
So, what, once every blue moon...

186
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,669
...Gus goes and visits
an old cartel assoclate.

187
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,518
That doesn't help me.

188
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,392
I can't hide out In a nursing home
for six months...

189
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:43,387
...hoplng on the off chance
that he comes back.

190
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,150
It's not even like they're friends.

191
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,557
Pinkman said it was like
he was torturing the old guy.

192
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,557
What does that mean?

193
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:56,194
He told him the last of his family
was dead. He enjoyed telling him.

194
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,038
Pinkman asked him about It.
All Gus would say...

195
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:02,470
...was that this Tio character
murdered someone close to him.

196
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,232
Walt.
Tlo murdered someone close to Gus?

197
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,477
I know,
It sounds not particularly frultful.

198
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,559
But, sorry, that's all I got.

199
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,469
They're enemies, not friends.

200
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,707
Next number in this cover-all game
where you cover the whole shimoly...

201
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,471
...is B numberthree,
like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

202
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,990
That's number three
In your B column.

203
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,033
Followed by 0, seven, four...

204
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,268
...that's 0, 74,
on the other side of your card.

205
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,675
Now we have
that lucky number B, number seven.

206
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,189
Is It lucky for you?

207
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,117
B, seven.

208
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,787
In the l row, two, one.

209
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,955
I, 21.

210
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,627
I know you despise me.

211
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,271
And I know how badly
you wanna see me dead.

212
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:07,554
But I'm willing to bet that I know a man
whom you hate even more.

213
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,990
Those N's just keep coming.
They're all sticking together.

214
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,551
I'm offering you an opportunity
for revenge.

215
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,750
G column, four, elght...

216
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,794

excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

217
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,999
Okay. I'm here.

218
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,510
How you doing this morning,
Mr. Salamanca? You need something?

219
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,836
You need to go poopie, huh?

220
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,234
Did you go poopie already? No?

221
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,997
What do you need?

222
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,270
You want me to get
the board for you?

223
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,832
Okay.

224
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,991
All right.

225
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,033

245
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,199
Finish the word, Mr. Salamanca.

246
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,478
Is It 'dear?'

247
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,150
Is It 'deal?'

248
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,674
Honey, 'dea' ain't a word.
Help me out here.

249
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,678
-Hey, son, what's up?
-When exactly are you getting here?

250
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,918
Just as soon as I can.

251
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,748
Look, this is a serious situation
and you're not taking it seriously.

252
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,915
Let me talk to him.

253
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,156
-Son, lam taklng thls serlously.
-lee It to me, Walter.

254
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,999
I'm concerned about your Uncle Hank
and his safety.

255
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:09,714
But whomever is making these threats
against him...

256
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,912
...I can assure you,
there's absolutely no Interest In me.

257
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,791
I'm not on anyone's radar.

258
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,957
-And besides, your mother and I--
-Give it to me. Walter.

259
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,788
Did you hear what he said?
Get over here. No more excuses.

260
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:25,116
Marle, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

261
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,309
-I promise.
-Hold on.

262
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:30,790
You wanna weigh in here?
Maybe you can talk sense into him?

263
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:33,911
Marle, he'll get here
when he gets here so....

264
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:39,109
I hope you sell plenty
of air fresheners.

265
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,470
I hope you have a banner day
over there.

266
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,910
Okay, Walt, don't worry
about a thing here. Goodbye.

267
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,158
And thank you for all of your help.

268
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,839
What's that?

269
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,077
Anything?

270
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,071
-Hey, everyone.
-Hl, Steve.

271
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,032
-How's everybody holding out?
-The man I wanna see.

272
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,911
Come here. Look at this.

273
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,036
-Jesus, enough with the laundry.
-No, no, no, hear me out.

274
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:32,391
This panel, if I'm reading it correctly,
is 7200 amp service.

275
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,388
This place has two of them, right?
That's a whole lot of juice, brother.

276
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,160
Laundry this size, typically,
has half that, okay?

277
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,839
What's with the extra panel?

278
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,157
-What are you, Thomas Edison?
-Asked a bunch of electricians.

279
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,716
They have their own chat rooms,
all they talked about was wiring.

280
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,150
Freaking Internet.
Find anything on it these days.

281
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,999
What do you say?
Pop over, have another look-see?

282
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,432
Llsten.

283
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,478
lthink we possibly have a lead
on something.

284
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,874
-Yeah?
-I have this guy down at the office.

285
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,196
He says he has some kind
of Information.

286
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,438
The thing ls, he'll only give It to you,
In person.

287
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,194
Okay.

288
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:19,754
-Do you remember Hector Salamanca?
-Yeah.

289
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,509
The old cripple guy with the bell?
Rather crap than talk to us?

290
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,951
-No, I don't remember him at all. Why?
-Well, he's the guy.

291
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,429
Hls nurse calls us,
says he wants to powwow.

292
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,278
So we have this guy at the office
for three hours.

293
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,789
And he still just wants to talk to you.

294
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:40,912
Do not even think
about going down there.

295
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,679
-Marle--
-Thls ls clearly a ploy or a trick...

296
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:47,918
...or something designed to get Hank
out into the open. That's all this is.

297
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,189
-Well, that's what we thought.
-Well....

298
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:52,788
It's been years
since this guy's been a player.

299
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:55,035
Hls nephew's gone,
doesn't have anybody.

300
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,675
The nurse checks out,
don't know nothing.

301
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,677
Guess ljust don't see an angle
here...

302
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,471
...if there even is one.

303
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,239
Of course,
If you did wanna talk to this guy...

304
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,556
...there's no safer place
than the office.

305
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,475
I don't think this sounds
like a good Idea.

306
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,998
Yeah. I agree, Uncle Hank.

307
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:14,269
It is a ridiculous idea.

308
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,598
And there's no way
that you're going to do it. End of story.

309
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,910
Hank, thanks for coming down.

310
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,347
No problem at all.

311
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,278
Good to see you, sir.

312
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,592

Thank you.

328
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:43,835
Yeah, thanks. I can spell.

329
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,630
Well, you got that out
of your system now?

330
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,194
Should we try this one more time?

331
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,552

337
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,199
Well, at least this time,
he didn't shlt himself.

338
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,551
I guess that's progress.

339
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,868
-Yes?
-We may have a problem.

340
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,478
I've got eyes on the DEA.

341
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,995
They just had a visitor.

342
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:09,798
Hector Salamanca.

343
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,750
I don't know what to say to you now.

344
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,079
Sit here and think about how far that
kind of behaviour is gonna get you.

345
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,555
Not far, let me tell you.

346
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,271
Any second thoughts?

347
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,796
Then let's get to work.

348
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,637


349
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,791


350
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,351


351
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,232


352
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,072


353
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:52,996
Mr. Pinkman...

354
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,907
...you're free to go.

355
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,909
Why? What happened?

356
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,632
Tox screen came back.

357
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,875
No rlcln polsonlng.

358
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,150
Surprlsed, huh?

359
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,636
No, why should I be?

360
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,397
Your jacket.

361
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,832
Tlll we meet again.

362
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,309
Okay. Okay.

363
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,431
Hey, yo. Yo, right here.

364
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,112
Hey, Andrea.

365
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,628
I'm just checking on Brock.

366
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,036
Hey, It sounds llke....

367
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,197
I mean, llsten,

368
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,994
-l'm heading back over. All right.
-Hey, excuse me.

369
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,395
Yes.

370
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,876
We just plcked up Plnkman.
No wltnesses.

371
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,308
What about Hector?

372
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,034
I've checked inside and out...

373
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,067
...no wlres, no camera,
no survelllance.

374
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:21,476
Police cruiser rolled through
an hour ago. Seemed routine.

375
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,558
It's just him, alone in his room.

376
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,677
All right.

377
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,513
I'm on my way.

378
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,189
Maybe it's better if I do this myself.

379
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,870
I do this.

380
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:20,476
It's all clear.

381
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,471
Walt here.

382
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,637
What kind of man talks to the DEA?

383
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,837


384
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,036
No man at all.

385
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:24,874
A crippled little rata.

386
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,197
What a reputation to leave behind.

387
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:43,149
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

388
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,992
Last chance to look at me, Hector.

389
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,950
Oh, my--

390
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,035
All right, all right.

391
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,436
-Let's get going.
-Oh, Jesus.

392
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,232
Oh, Jesus.

393
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,833
Why don't we start evacuating?

394
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,797
-Start evacuatlon on the south side.
-Call Securlty.

395
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,830
Everyone outside right now.

396
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,074
--In the same boat for sure.
But It's that tlme agaln...

397
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,475
...where we tell you
about your own hell...

398
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,910
...Albuquerque afternoon commute.
How bad are things out there?

399
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,908
I tell you what, right now southbound
25, got an accident at Jefferson.

400
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,634
Make sure you stay to the left
through that area.

401
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,515
Things have slowed to a crawl
at the Big I, no surprises there either.

402
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,997
Hate to interrupt, I have breaking news.
Now, coming out of the North Valley...

403
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,872
...an exploslon has been reported
at a nurslng home.

404
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,991
-Casa Tranqulla nurslng home.
-Oh, no.

405
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,111
You heard of that place.
We got few details on it so far.

406
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,950
Unfortunately, initial report is though,
that three people may have been killed.

407
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,991
-Oh, no.
-The news Is dlsturblng.

408
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,077
We're gonna get you information
as soon as it comes in.

409
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:32,749
Situation over there is pretty hectic.
What's traffic looking like?

410
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,075
If you're moving through that area...

411
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:38,749
...we're talking about East and
Westbound Paseo, North Valley.

412
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,394
Please, avold that area
as you move through.

413
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,798
Our heart's going out to the victims.
We'll bring you details as we get them.

414
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:49,469
Coming up on Coyote 102.5,
Aerosmith, DefLeppard.

415
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,113
Keep It rlght here
on New Mexlco's ﬂnest rock--

416
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,718
You wanna cook with a broken arm?

417
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,549
Next step, 002.

418
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,238
Do It.

419
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,713
Hey.

420
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:54,872
I better hear them click.

421
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,591
What, you got a problem with stairs?

422
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,878


423
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,955
We've got work to do.

424
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,198
He's gonna pull through.

425
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,799
Yeah?

426
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,232
Yeah. It looked kind of touch-and-go
there for a while...

427
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:58,157
...but he's gonna....

428
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:01,116
He's gonna make it.

429
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:03,835
Oh, thank God.

430
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,710
Oh, thank God.

431
00:43:13,479 --> 00:43:18,030
You know,
stlll saying It wasn't the rlcln.

432
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,071
I don't understand.

433
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,998
Then what was it?

434
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:29,796
Saying it was most likely a flower
called lily of the valley.

435
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:32,356
It's, like, common.

436
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,950
It's got these red berries on it
that I guess taste sweet...

437
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,470
...and sometimes kids eat them
and wind up poisoning themselves.

438
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,557
And that's it, nothing more.

439
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,755
So Gus didn't poison him after all.

440
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,676
Still he had to go...

441
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,279
...rlght?

442
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,271
Damn rlght.

443
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:08,470
Gus had to go.

444
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,479
Yeah.

445
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,398
You know, I should--

446
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:20,152
I should get back.

447
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,237
Andrea's waltlng.

448
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,634
I'm at Casa Tranqulla
where three are dead...

449
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,469
...following an explosion
that rocked this facility earlier today.

450
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,352
The fireball completely consumed
one resident's room...

451
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:18,311
...and damaged common areas
nearby.

452
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:19,474
Walt?

453
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:21,829
Let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

454
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:24,758
-Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
-Walt?

455
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:26,028
How you dolng?

456
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,196
How am I doing? How are you doing?

457
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,033


458
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,595
I'm doing quite well.

459
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,638
I'm good.

460
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:40,588
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

461
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,233
Gus Frlng ls dead.

462
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,110
He was blown up with some person
from some Mexican cartel...

463
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,993
...and the DEA has no Idea
what to make of It.

464
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:51,992
Do you know about this?

465
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,195
-Walt? I need you to--
-lt's over.

466
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,754
We're safe.

467
00:45:57,959 --> 00:46:00,314
--might've heard a rumbling sound...

468
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:04,114
...and another reported a, quote,
”ringing" in the moments just prior.

469
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,435
Admlnlstrators
at Casa Tranqulla advlse...

470
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,997
...that if you do have loved ones
in their care, please do not call in....

471
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,996
Was this you?

472
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,316
What happened?

473
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,478
