00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,910
Organlc chemlstry
wlth a speclallty In....

177
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,757
It's all rlght there.

178
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,037
'X-ray crystallography.‘

179
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,188
Really?

180
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,870
I could talk about that for hours.

181
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,314
I would love to.

182
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,916
But flrst, I'm curlous about thls.

183
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,675
That's a llttle pet project of mlne.

184
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,597
See, In my oplnlon,
It's all about the qulnlc acId level.

185
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,513
You want Just north of 4800 mIllIgrams
per lltre...

186
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,115
...but If you over-boll to get there,
you'll leach your tannlns.

187
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,396
Bltterness, yuck.

188
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,834
So I pull a mIld vacuum.

189
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,073
That way, I can keep the temperature
no hlgher than 92 c and....

190
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,952
Judge for yourself.

191
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,237
Oh, my God.

192
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,117
My God, that Is the best coffee
I've ever tasted.

193
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:44,516
Sumatran beans...

194
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,797
...and I also have to glve credlt
to the grlnd...

195
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,553
-...but thank you, Mr. Whlte.
-Walt.

196
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,710
Please, call me Walt.

197
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,079
Why the hell are we maklng meth?

198
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,271
Hey.

199
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,953
Tell me...

200
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,554
...wlth the phenylacetlc acId
solutlon...

201
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:13,110
...you sald 150 drops per mlnute
for the flrst 1o mlnutes...

202
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,829
...and then 90 for the remalnder.
Why Is that?

203
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,676
Well, my thlnklng Is,
by taperlng the phenyl...

204
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,275
...you get an olller aqueous layer,
and hence--

205
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,078
Better benzene extractlon.

206
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,797
Exactly.

207
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:32,234
But actually, I prefer ether.

208
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,118
Oh, I'll have It for tomorrow.

209
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,434
Gale, I'm wonderlng how you--

210
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,396
Ended up here.

211
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,669
Well, actually, I'm stlll wonderlng
how I ended up here, but, yes.

212
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,629
I mean, I can't lmaglne
we strlke each other as crImlnals.

213
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,557
Well, there's crlme
and then there's crlme...

214
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,631


215
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,552
I'm deflnltely a llbertarlan.

216
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,470
Consentlng adults want
what they want...

217
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:13,995
...and If I'm not supplylng If,
they wlll get It somewhere else.

218
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,799
Wlth me, they're gettlng exactly
what they pay for.

219
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:20,588
No added toxlns or adulterants.

220
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,394
Yeah, I was dolng It
the way you are supposed to...

221
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,314
...pursulng my doctorate at Colorado,
NSF research grant.

222
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,074
l was on my way,
Jumplng through hoops...

223
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,036
...klsslng the proper behlnds...

224
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,399
...attendlng to all the non-chemlstry
that one flnds oneself occupled by.

225
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,958
You know that world.

226
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,874
That Is not what I slgned on for.

227
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:50,754
I love the lab.

228
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,196
Because It's all stlll maglc.

229
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,348
You know?

230
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,031
Chemlstry?

231
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,631


232
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,877
...once you lose that...

233
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,155
It Is.

234
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,713
It Is maglc.

235
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,949
It stlll ls.

236
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,593
And all the whlle, I kept thlnklng
about that great old Whltman poem:

237
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:19,512
'When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer.‘

238
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,912
I don't know It.

239
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,389
Anyway....

240
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,755
Well, can you reclte It?

241
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,115
Pathetlcally enough, I could.

242
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,315
All rlght, well....

243
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,788
No, no, come on. Come on.

244
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,028
Yeah?

245
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,553
When I heard the learn'd astronomer

246
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:50,199
When the proofs, the ﬁgures
Were ranged In columns before me

247
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,998
When I was shown the charts
And the dlagrams

248
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,720
To add, dlvlde, and measure them

249
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,995
When I, sIttIng,
Heard the astronomer

250
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,836
Where he lectured wlth much applause
In the lecture-room

251
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,514
How soon, unaccountable
I became tIred and slck

252
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:10,829
Tlll rIsIng and glIdIng out

253
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,990
I wander'd off by myself

254
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,789
In the mystlcal molst nIght-alr

255
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,632
And from tlme to tlme

256
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,237
Look'd up In perfect sIlence
At the stars

257
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,357
Yes.

258
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,153
I am a nerd.

259
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,629
-Bravo.
-Thank you.

260
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,878
Come on, Plnkman.

261
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,033
You llttle rat bastard.

262
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,351
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

263
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,192
-Hey, baby.
-Are you ever comlng home?

264
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,634
Marle, I'm worklng.

265
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,472
DId you flnd It? The RV?

266
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,311
No. Worklng on It, so....

267
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,395
Why can't you Just arrest hlm,
make hlm tell you?

268
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,313
It's not slmple.
There's a thlng called the Constltutlon.

269
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:41,516
Constltutlon, blah, blah, blah.

270
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,749
Thls kld, Iswear to God,
I wlsh I just could....

271
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,913
Thls Is that Plnkman character?

272
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,148
That's the one.

273
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,470
Posltlve the llttle bastard's
got an RV.

274
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,755
IJust don't know where he keeps It.

275
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,390
Untll he actually leads me to It
or does somethlng...

276
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,235
...l'm stuck here, Marle, so sorry.

277
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,995
Well, not to brlng up
anclent hlstory...

278
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,869
...but I, for one, can thlnk of someone
who mlght know somethlng.

279
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,032
Posslbly.

280
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,553
It's worth a shot.

281
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,391
Yeah?

282
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,272
Who?

283
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,759
-Hel|o.
-Oh, hey, buddy.

284
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,069
Hey, how you dolng?

285
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,877
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

286
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,917
Llsten, I hate to bother you.

287
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,877
-I just had a qulck questlon.
-Shoot.

288
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,032
I only ask thls because I'm at a,
you know, dead end here, potentlally.

289
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,475
I'm worklng a case and--

290
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:47,632
You know that I would never put you on
the spot or make you uncomfortable.

291
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,360
Hank, you could Just cut
to the chase.

292
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,036
Back when we lost you
and l was trylng to track you down...

293
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,191
through your student,
Jesse Plnkman.

294
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,068
Now, you know that I know
that once upon a tlme...

295
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,435
...he may have dealt you
a llttle weed.

296
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,827
-Hank--
-Just a llttle.

297
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,468
And I so do not care about that.

298
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,789
As far as I'm concerned,
you never Inhaled.

299
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,517
lee you sald, cut to the chase.

300
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,879
Do you remember
If thls Plnkman kId ever had an RV?

301
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,870
You know, a recreatlonal vehlcle...

302
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,352
...you know, llke a WInnebago-type
deal, brown and belge?

303
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,108
Why?

304
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,034
Long story, but I'm personally of
the oplnlon he's moved on from weed...

305
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,832
...and graduated to selllng
crystal meth, uslng It as a rolllng lab.

306
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,199
Walt?

307
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,589
Yo.

308
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,913
What, Mr. Whlte?

309
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,557

Yes, what's wlth the--?

312
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,554
Hey, hello to you too.

313
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,153
Llsten, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.

314
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,992
-l'm llstenlng.
-My brother-In-law...

315
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,037
...he knows about the RV.

316
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,189
What RV?

317
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,509
Our RV...

318
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,798
...the one whlch contalns a meth lab,
whlch Is covered wlth my flngerprlnts.

319
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:50,429
What does 'knows about' mean?
Does he have It? Has he searched It?

320
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:53,238
No, he knows It exlsts
and he's trylng to flnd It.

321
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:57,312
He has llnked It to Jesse. It's a matter
of tlme before he tracks It down.

322
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,993
So get rId of Itl
What are you dolng sIttIng there?

323
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,595
Better yet, have Plnkman get rld of It.
nght? You don't go near It.

324
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,513
My brother-ln-law,
he Is survellllng Jesse's house.

325
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,877
So he mlght have tapped the phones
or bugged hls house.

326
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,236
Jesus. Plan A, then.
Go. Get to It before the feds do.

327
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,437
And do what exactly?

328
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,112
I mean, what--?

329
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,319
The thlng Is the slze of a--

330
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:23,753
It's RV-slze.

331
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,388
lmean, where do I go
to make an RV dlsappear?

332
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,958
I'm not DavId Copperfleld.

333
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,714
What do I look llke,
the RV dlsposal people?

334
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:33,154
-D|d you not plan for thls contlngency?
-No.

335
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,515
Well, next tlme, plan for It,
would you?

336
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,319
The Starshlp Enterprlse
had a self-destruct button.

337
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,515
Okay. Shut up.

338
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,558
I'm Just saylng,
you're good wlth tools and all.

339
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:48,793
Why don't you Invent
a water-powered car, you know?

340
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,917
You dId that,
you would be rolllng In It.

341
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,278
Socket wrench.

342
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,157
The blg one.

400
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:40,869
Who are you, huh? Who are you

00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,076
Well, I'm the owner of thls lot...

402
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:46,470
...whlch means you're trespasslng
on prlvate property.

403
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,358
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me It's locked...

404
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,150
...whlch means you're trylng to break
and enter, so agaln, you got a warrant?

405
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,788
Well, I don't need one
If I've got probable cause, counsellor.

406
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,635
Probable cause usually relates
to vehlcles, Is my understandlng.

407
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,155
You know, trafflc stops and whatnot.

408
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,828
See these round rubber thlngs?

409
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,319

410
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:10,912
Thls Is a vehlcle.

411
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,553
Thls Is a domlclle, a resldence...

412
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,477
...protected by the Fourth Amendment
from unlawful search and selzure.

413
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:22,597
-Why don't you Just go out--?
-D|d you see thls drlve?

414
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,033

There was a flrearm dlscharged
lnslde of thls domlclle.

422
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,908
There's a Judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

423
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,513
Call the Albuquerque pollce....

424
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,753
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

425
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:04,908

Probable cause
needs to be readlly apparent.

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,836
There's somebody In there.

433
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,198
