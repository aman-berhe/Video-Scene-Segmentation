4
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:11,315
You buylng
or you Just stopplng to envy?

5
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,796
Yeah. Punk bitches.

Please leave your message
for 505-127-5223.

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,793
Record your message after the tone.
To send a numeric page--

8
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,068
Bounce, little man.

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,636
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

10
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,989
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

11
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,394
Get your ass up here now.

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,917
-What's that thing in your ear?
-What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,989
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,710
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

15
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,991
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,393
Absolutely.

17
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,919
As you know...

18
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,998
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,796
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,312
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,237
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,999
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

23
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,667
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,110
He's got a good track record.

25
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,833
Pretty good.

26
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,476
It sounds...

27
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,789
...aggresslve.

28
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,032
Yes. Very much so.

29
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,913
Understand that
It you don't have this surgery...

30
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,315
...you're Just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,555
And It will.

32
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,271
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,437
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

34
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,998
...but that's all.

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,918
In my opinion...

36
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,314
...if you're willing to take some risk...

37
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,555
...then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,718
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,592
I'd say between 170-...

40
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,109


41
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,755
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

42
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,632
...but mine Isn't even
the biggest expense.

43
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,076
This is obviously a big decision...

44
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,431
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,759


46
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,117
I'll do It.

47
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,670
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,793
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,871
l have to say,
lthlnk It's the right choice.

50
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,035
I recommend
that we let the pneumonltls heal...

51
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,958
...for another couple of weeks...

52
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,354
...and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,676
That's tricky.

54
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:44,669
-When's the due date?
-lt's the 21st.

55
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,153
So two weeks and change?

56
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,475
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,672
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,076
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,953
Yeah.

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,834
Fourteen messages...

61
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,836


62
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,193
-Yeah.
-lt's me.

63
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,676
Where the hell were you?
I called, llke, 20 tlmes.

64
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,198
Working.

65
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,674
What Is It?

66
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,238
Combo's dead.

67
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,353
Shot

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,069
Which one is he?

69
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,793
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,354
-Jesse, llsten--
-That figures.

71
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,072
What's the word on the street?

72
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,796
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,037
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

74
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,869
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,157
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

76
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,077
...what'd you expect?

77
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,514
I don't know.

78
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,312
You don't know?

79
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,231
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,113
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,316
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,993
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

83
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,431
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali....

84
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,798
I'm on probation, man.

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,753
Fast track to Los Lunas.

86
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,196
We're on the verge...

87
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,439
...of making some serious coln,
Skinny.

88
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,994
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

89
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,593
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

90
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,434
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

91
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,393
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

92
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,752
-...thlng to the head thing, the ATM?
-Yeah?

93
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,632
His junkie bitch copped to it.

94
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,674
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

95
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,912
Everyone knows?

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,515
-Why didn't you say something?
-I don't know, man.

97
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:30,118
Because we like you and all.

98
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,312
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

99
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,387
We'll get by.

100
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,228
-All right? We'll make It.
-Sorry, Jesse.

101
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,478
I'm out.

102
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:54,790
We have had a bit of a setback.

103
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,830
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,713
-How about "your fault"?
-No, no, don't lay that on me.

105
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,956
-You are in charge of distribution.
-You said expand the territory.

106
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,468
-Doesn't mean you become careless.
-Guys, guys! Hey!

107
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,432
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counsellor.

108
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,154
Now, you're professionals.
Act like It.

109
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,316
Now, setback. Go.

110
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:19,436
One of our dealers was murdered.

111
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,358
It was some kind of turf dispute...

112
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,596
...and apparently we lost.

113
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,438
And then everyone quit on us.

114
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,349
I mean,
we have absolutely no dlstrlbutlon.

115
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,915
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

116
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,076
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

117
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,631
Well, there's your silver lining.

118
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,512
How about you?
How's the health situation?

119
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,871
It's better. Do you mind?

120
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,479
Better?

121
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,717
Yeah, It's...

122
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,591
I may have more time than I thought.

123
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,551
Outstanding.

124
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,955
Now, as to your dead guy:

125
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,878
occupational hazard.

126
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,274
Drug dealer getting shot?

127
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:12,358
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

128
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,517
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

129
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,710
Thirty-eight and change.

130
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,716
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

131
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,069
Pounds.

132
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,307
You did say make hay
while the sun ls shlnlng.

133
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,510
Guysl

134
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,517
Why the long faces here?

135
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,756
You're sitting on a gold mine.

136
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,950
A gold mine we can't sell.

137
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,354
We need a proper infrastructure.

138
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,790
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

139
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,751
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

140
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,917
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

141
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,996
Payback. That's what we need.

142
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,399


143
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,316
I mean, this entire process
has just been so....

144
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,070
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

145
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,671
We need your help.

146
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,794
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

147
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,591
Ready for this? Here goes.

148
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,553
You two suck at peddling meth.
Perlod.

149
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,115
So give up on trying
to do It all yourselves.

150
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,628
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

151
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,071
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

152
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,395
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

153
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,114
What, some tattooed speed freak?

154
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,596
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

155
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,518
Somebody who treats your product...

156
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,951
...llke the simple
high-margin commodity that It Is.

157
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,231
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

158
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,592
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

159
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,272
You know someone like that?

160
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,268
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

161
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,276
Who knows another guy.

162
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,155
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

163
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,031
Well, what's his name?

164
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,719
l have no Idea.

165
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,188
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

166
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,390
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

167
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,511
...he sounds a little like you.

168
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,998
And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.

169
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,668
He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.

170
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,792
Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,390
And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.

172
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,556
I need you to leave.

173
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,076
Look, there's...

174
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,997
...some stuff about me
you don't know and....

175
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,312
Like you're a drug dealer?

176
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,518
I kind of got that.

177
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,634
You pay In cash
and you use an alias, so....

178
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,034
One of my guys...

179
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,479
...a friend who worked for me...

180
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,754
...got murdered.

181
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,710
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

182
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,394
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

183
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:35,478
...being that you're in a programme
and all and....

184
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,316
You could come with me
to a meeting.

185
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,792


186
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,398
No meetings.

187
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:50,668
We could just get out of here.

188
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,077
-It won't help.
-Yeah, It will.

189
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,634
And I don't need you
telling me that It won't.

190
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,318
ljust....

191
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,114
All right, I reallyjust need you to go.

192
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,877
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

193
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,593
Thank you.

194
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,191
You're late.

195
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,868
Yeah.

196
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,753
We're in the big time now.

197
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,555
So where's the kingpin?

198
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,834
Your guess is as good as mine.

199
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,747
So you get the dude's name?

200
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,518


201
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,836
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

202
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,998
...what we look llke,
but not the other way around?

203
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,354
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

204
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,710
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

205
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,512
...looking like a couple chumps?

206
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:23,392
Gentlemen,
Is everything to your satisfaction?

207
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,074
Flne, thanks.

208
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,072
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

209
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,277
I don't get you, man.

210
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:36,108
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

211
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,476
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

212
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,352
Yeah, what about after?

213
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,791
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

214
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,355
lee, 'I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more.‘

215
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,596
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

216
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,237
-Thlngs have changed.
-0h, I know.

217
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,757
We got a guy killed.

218
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,871
You know what?

219
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,473
This Is bullshlt.

220
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,396
-l'm out of here.
-Hey.

221
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,871
I think she's waking up from a nap.

222
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,356
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

223
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,312
We have to keep an eye
on your flulds.

224
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,111
You're on the low side of normal.

225
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,788
What? How low?

226
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,991
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

227
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,556
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

228
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,392
Hey.

229
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,636
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

230
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,717
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

231
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,830
-Sorry. HI.
-Hl.

232
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,349
-What did I miss?
-For your refrigerator.

233
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,558
Oh, my God.

234
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,908
Look at her.

235
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,472
-Look.
-Yeah.

236
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,193
God. It's like she's here already.

237
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:03,835
l was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

238
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,156
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

239
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,191
It's time to make a decision.

240
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,391
-You know what I'm gonna say.
-The c-sectlon?

241
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,750
And If It's a yes,
we need to schedule It.

242
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,640
For the baby, I say yes.

243
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,479
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

244
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,797
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

245
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,398
...a week from Friday?

246
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,878
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

247
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,151
We have a birthday.

248
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:44,118
The 16th.

249
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,356
-I like It.
-Yeah.

250
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,710
You know, speaking of birthdays...

251
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,310
...l've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

252
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,192
It's an hour before closing.

253
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,356
You're supposed to be
taking It easy.

254
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,676
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

255
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,437
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

256
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,113
Why you?

257
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,634
Because I said I would...?

258
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:11,307
It is the least I can do.

259
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,314
-0kay?
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.

260
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,838
-Bye.
-Bye.

261
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:04,357
Let's get out of here.

262
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,675
You know, go do something.

263
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,837
Seriously.

264
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,310
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

265
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,756
Let's take a drive.

266
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,152
Sure.

267
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,753
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

268
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,791
We're halfway through the job.

269
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,672
Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.

270
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,313
All right.
Just let me think about It, okay?

271
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,713
I gotta go.

272
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,830
Dean, I gotta go.

273
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,109
Okay, all right.

274
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,718
Happy birthday!

275
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,787
Happy birthday!

276
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,071
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

277
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,874
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

278
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,558
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

279
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,468
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's In the toilet.

280
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,751
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

281
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,394
-Wa|t. Skyler?
-Yes?

282
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,113
I wanna hear it first.

283
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,478
Absolutely not. No way.

284
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,830
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

285
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,678
-Yes, I can. Watch me.
-Pleasel

286
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,508
If this is your birthday wish,
lfeel very, very sorry for you.

287
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,030
-Come on. It was so good last time.
-It was ages ago.

288
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,992
And I'm enormous now.

289
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,316
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

290
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,714
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

291
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,228
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

292
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,111
-Ser|ously.
-Yes, come on, Skyler.

293
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,836
-Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....
-lt's obscene.

294
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,872
Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....

295
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:18,913
Happy birthday to you

296
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:25,472
Happy birthday to you

297
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,910
Happy birthday, Mr. President

298
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,237
Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated

299
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,633
Happy blrthday

300
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,111
To you

301
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,552
That was fantastic.

302
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,511
Isn't she great, huh?

303
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,991
Okay, here we go.

304
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,113
-He wasn't there.
-Oh, he was there, all rlght.

305
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,753
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

306
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,028
Nobody came.

307
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:16,753
All I know Is my contact
sald he was there.

308
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,110
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

309
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,072
Yes, I'm posltlve.

310
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,712
-Where was he?
-Who knows?

311
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,479
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

312
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,397
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

313
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,798
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

314
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,351
What? What do you mean?

315
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,879
No deal. No dice.

316
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,957
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

317
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:39,354
Walt a minute.

318
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,949
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

319
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,152
I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?

320
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,634
He's skittish, like a deer.

321
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,758
Call him back.

322
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,916
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

323
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,633
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

324
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,989
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

325
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,350
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

326
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,151
Second of all, it's over.

327
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,715
Understand?
Wlth thls partlcular lndlvldual...

328
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,195
...all you get is the one shot.

329
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,549
Look...

330
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,273
...l'll see If I can scrape
something else together...

331
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,152
...but don't get your hopes up.

332
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,999
No one else handles
that klnd of bulk.

333
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,679
Damn It.

334
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,952
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

335
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,671
Can I help you, sir?

336
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,629
Diet Coke, please.

337
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,392
And five minutes of your time.

338
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,113
-What can I do for you?
-Have a seat.

339
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,318
Please.

340
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,399
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

341
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,314
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

342
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,869
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

343
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,954
I believe that person was you.

344
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:03,550
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

345
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,192
I don't think I am.

346
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,911
Sir, if you have a complaint...

347
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,269
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

348
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,835
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

349
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,118
l was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

350
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,515
...Is very careful.

351
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,631
A cautlous man.

352
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,193
I believe we're alike in that way.

353
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,715
If you are who I think you are...

354
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,230
...you should give me another chance.

355
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,838
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

356
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,272
You are not a cautious man at all.

357
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,358
Your partner was late
and he was high.

358
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,119
Yes. Yes, he was.

359
00:27:56,879 --> 00:27:59,951
He's high often, isn't he?

360
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,118
You have poorjudgement.

361
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,436
I can't work with someone
with poorjudgement.

362
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:11,631
Are you familiar with my product?

363
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:15,675
-l've been told It's excellent.
-It Is lmpeccable.

364
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,232
It Is the purest...

365
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,750
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

366
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,190
That is not the only factor.

367
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,187
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

368
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,754
...and your customers would pay it.

369
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,952


370
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,835
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

371
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,947
You won't see him.

372
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,798
You won't interact with him.

373
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,918
Forget he exlsts.

374
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,594
l have to ask.

375
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,315
Why?

376
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,237
Why hlm?

377
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,238
Because he does what I say.

378
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,948
Because I can trust him.

379
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,556
How much product
do you have on hand?

380
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,117
Thirty-eight pounds.

381
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,834
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

382
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,592
Will I hear from you?

383
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:24,478
l have your numbers.

384
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,308
You can never trust a drug addict.

385
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,313
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

386
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,556
...but right here,
take Keller, for Instance.

387
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:56,149
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

388
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,839
Dribs and drabs.

389
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,030
Once you add It all up, though,
with Keller...

390
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:03,549
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

391
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,629
And this Is every quarter
for the last two years.

392
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,035
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

393
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:18,117
I found six other instances...

394
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:21,673
...of revenues being under-reported.

395
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:25,233
And I've only just started
to look Into It.

396
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,671
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

397
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:31,029
They antlclpate their needs
for the next quarter.

398
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,036
Most of the time, they overestimate.

399
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:35,548
I let them roll their overages
Into the next order...

400
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:37,795
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

401
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,557
Obviously, we forgot...

402
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,593
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

403
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,916
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

404
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,589
...the money's comlng In eventually,
as you can see.

405
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:52,958
Right.

406
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,678
Right...

407
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:59,316
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

408
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,794
...to try and sort this out.

409
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:06,758
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

410
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,110
In a few cases...

411
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,597
...I found xeroxed coples
with the dates changed.

412
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,158
Ted.

413
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,478
All rlght.

414
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,718
You got me.

415
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:38,915
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

416
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,352
-What are you thinking?
-l'm thinking...

417
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,630
...about saving a company.

418
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,558
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

419
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,477
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

420
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:51,830
...and their college funds
for their kids.

421
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:53,788
Not to mention my own.

422
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,467
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

423
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,272
Yes, It does, Skyler.

424
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,311
It's In the books.
Business Is terrlble.

425
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,670
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

426
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:05,278
-If I don't keep up--
-Ted.

427
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,199
People go to prison for this.

428
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:16,917
My dad built this company
from nothing.

429
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,114
We make things here.

430
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,232
The people who work here
are like family.

431
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,354
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

432
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,788
Sky...

433
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,391
...don't report thls.

434
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,873
Please.

435
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,553
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

436
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,555
But I can't be a part of it.

437
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,913


438
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,669
I know. ljust wlsh....

439
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,397
I'm sorry.

440
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,192
I don't want you to go.

441
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,158
Yo, ifI know you, leave a message.

442
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,999
Yo, lt's Sklnny Pete.
Just checklng In wlth you, man.

443
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,952
We missed you at the funeral today.

444
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,558
The whole crew was representing.

445
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,636
Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.

446
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,831
Combo's people, hls ma,
grandma, couslns...

447
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,916
...everyone was all choked up
and shlt.

448
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,679
Man, it was, like, emotional.

449
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:42,756
And you should have
seen the cofﬁn.

450
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:44,756
It was this shiny white pearlescent.

451
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,917
I'm sure I've seen
the exact same palnt job on a Lexus.

452
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:50,952
So we're definitely talking high-end.

453
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:57,397
Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.

454
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,037
I like to mix some ice with it.

455
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,192
Hold that.

456
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,879
What's it feel like?

457
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,118
There's a chill.

458
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:40,429
Don't freak out. It passes.

459
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,108
And then....

460
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:43,388
You'll see.

461
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,551
I'll meet you there.

462
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,398
Take that off.

463
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:28,154
Phones off, please.

464
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,475
Plpes, I guess.

465
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,352
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

466
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,911
Eyes on your paper.

467
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,674
Yes.

468
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,913
Excuse me, where's the manager?

469
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,314
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

470
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,795
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

471
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:32,752
He's a black gentleman.
He's thln. Glasses.

472
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:34,438
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

473
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,392
Oh, owner. Okay.

474
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,239
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

475
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:41,634
He could be at any one of them.

476
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:46,195
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

477
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,994
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

478
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,157
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

479
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,112


480
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,197
-What's his name?
-Gustavo.

481
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,833


482
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:58,994
Thank you.

483
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,428
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

484
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,950
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

485
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,434
-One hour.
-What?

486
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,959
One hour. You in or out?

487
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,596
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

488
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:17,710
One hour. If you miss it...

489
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,514
...don't ever show your face
In here again.

490
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,992
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck....

491
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,191
-Come on! Come on!
-Yo, lfl know you, leave a message.

492
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:35,072
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

493
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:37,031
Pick up the phone.

494
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:40,432
I'm coming by. I need the product.

495
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,358
I need the product now.

496
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,195
Oh, God.

497
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,599
Jesse.

498
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,438
Jessel

499
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,597
Jesse.

500
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,038
Jesse.

501
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,713
Jesse. Jesse.

502
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,558
Jesse.

503
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:39,549
Jesse.

504
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,273
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

505
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:43,071
Jesse.

506
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,267
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

507
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:47,548
Wake up!

508
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:49,272
Come on, damn It.

509
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:50,707
Wake up.

510
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:52,994
Where'd you put it?

511
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,871
-Where's the product?
-Get off of me.

512
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,833
Where Is It?
Where'd you hide the meth?

513
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,711
-In the kitchen.
-Where?

514
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,430
Under the sink.

515
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,074
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
