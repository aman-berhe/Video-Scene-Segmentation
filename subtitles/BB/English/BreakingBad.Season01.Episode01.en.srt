1
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,192
Oh, my god.

2
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:09,832
Chrlltl

3
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,678
Shlt.

4
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,795
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,672
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Thlnk, thlnk, thlnk.

6
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,677
Oh, my gosh.

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,990
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.

8
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,957
Come on.

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,716
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

10
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,152
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

11
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:20,034
To all law-enforcement entities,
this is not an admission of guilt.

12
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,993
lam speaking to my family now.

13
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,397
Skylar.

14
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,669
You are the love of my life.

15
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,757
I hope you know that.

16
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,076
Walter Jr.

17
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:41,235
You're my big man.

18
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,997
There are--
There are going to be some things--

19
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,713
Things that you'll
come to learn about me...

20
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,511
...In the next few days.

21
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,998
I just want you to know
that no matter how it may look...

22
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,667
...I only had you in my heart.

23
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,111
Goodbye.

24
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,950
--money before the panel
earlier this year.

25
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,558
Happy birthday.

26
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,069
Look at that.

27
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,275
That is veggie bacon.

28
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,198
Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol...

29
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,867
...and you won't even
taste the difference.

30
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,392
What time do you think
you'll be home?

31
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,668
Same tlme.

32
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,835
I don't want him
dlcklng you around tonight.

33
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,748
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5. No later.

34
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,598
Hey.

35
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,355
-Hey, happy birthday.
-Well, thank you.

36
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:33,311
You're late agaln.

37
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,987
There was no hot water again.

38
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,951
l have an easy fix for that.

39
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,516
You wake up early, and then you get
to be the first person in the shower.

40
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,233
l have an Idea.

41
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,471
How about
buy a new hot-water heater?

42
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,232
How's that idea?
For the million-billionth time.

43
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,989
-Dld you take your echlnacea?
-Yeah.

44
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,030
I think it's getting better.

45
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,594
What the hell is this?

46
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:04,914
-Hey.
-lt'a veggle bacon.

47
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,873
We're watching our cholesterol,
I guess.

48
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,595
Not me. I want real bacon.
Not this take crap.

49
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,312
Too bad. Eat It.

50
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,756
-Thls smells like Band-Aids.
-Eat It.

51
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,755
-So how does it feel to be old?
-How does it feel to be a smart-ass?

52
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,237


53
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,358
Eat your veggie bacon.

54
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,318
-You're all set?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

55
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,318
-All right, see you at home.
-0kay, see you.

56
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,478
Chemistry.

57
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
It is the study of what?

58
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,993
Anyone?

59
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,633


60
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,433
-Chem|cals.
-Chem|cals.

61
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,915


62
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,429
Chemistry |s....

63
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,589
Well, technically,
chemistry Is the study of matter.

64
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:25,757
But I prefer to see It
as the study of change.

65
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,428
Now, just-- Just think about this.

66
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,118
Electrons.

67
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,752
They...

68
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,832
...change their energy levels.

69
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,836


70
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,678
Molecules change their bonds.

71
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,751
Elements. They combine
and change into compounds.

72
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,553
Well, that's-- That's all of life, right?

73
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,193
I mean, It's Just--
It's the constant, It's the cycle.

74
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,030
It's solution, dissolution,
Just over and over and over.

75
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,995
It Is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

76
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,750
It is fascinating, really.

77
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,438
Chad.

78
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,909
Is there something wrong
with your table?

79
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,398
Okay, lonlc bonds.

80
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,836
Are you done?

81
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,430
lonic bonds. Chapter six.

82
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,874
One, two, three makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

83
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,035
There's your receipt.

84
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,470
Just hand this disc
to your car-wash professional.

85
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,795
Thank you. Come again.

86
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,758
He's not coming. He says he quits.

87
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,833
I'm gonna run the register.

88
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:14,668
Bogdan, no. We talked about this.

89
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,189
I'm short-handed, Walter.
What am I to do?

90
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,631
Walter?

91
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,870
What am I to do?

92
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,395
Hey, Mr. White.

93
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,875
-Make those tyres shine, huh?
-0h, my God.

94
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,469
You will not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

95
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,431
Mr. White.

96
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,755
From chemistry.

97
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,791
Surprise!

98
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,713
Happy birthday, Dad.

99
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,956
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

100
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,754
-0h, you're so very late.
-Happy birthday.

101
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,590
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.
I mean, you're flat as a washboard.

102
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,437
You look awesome.

103
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,269
-She's not showing at all, is she?
-She's showing a little.

104
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,874
Carmen, this is my sister, Marie.

105
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,116
-N|ce to meet you.
-Hl.

106
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,039
Clock 22,
that's my daily carry, okay?

107
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,913
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, Plus P Plus loads...

108
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,633
...you can forget the 9 mil.

109
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,512
Shit, I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

110
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,551
-Yeah, with you shooting.
-Hey.

111
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,112
If you're gonna bring a gun, baby,
you gotta bring enough gun.

112
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,992
Forty callbre.

113
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,352
-Thls ls awesome.
-Nlce, Isn't It?

114
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,313
-Yeah. Dad, come check this out.
-Yeah, I see It.

115
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,794
-Come on, take It.
-Yeah. Check It out, Walt.

116
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,474
-No, no, It's Just heavy.
-That's why they hire men.

117
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,078
Hey, it's not gonna bite you.

118
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,669
Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

119
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,473
Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen up,
listen up, listen up.

120
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,309
I'm gonna give a toast, a little toast
to my brother-in-law. Come here.

121
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,678
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin...

122
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,110
...but we're not gonna hold that
against you.

123
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,558
But your heart's in the right place.

124
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,148
Your heart's In the right place.
We love you, man.

125
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,794
Everybody, to Walt.

126
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,830
Oh, shit. Turn on channel three.

127
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,307
At which point we apprehended three
individuals and placed them in custody.

128
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,953
i'm proud to say
the outstanding professionalism...

129
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,277
...of my fellow agents
at the Albuquerque District Office...

130
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,039
...resulted in a substantial amount
of methamphetamine...

131
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,639
...being taken off the streets.

132
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,557
-Were any shots fired?
-No, ma'am.

133
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,715
Our agents took the suspects
by surprise.

134
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,673
-Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.
-Ten pounds?

135
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,348
Hey, sit and spin, both of you.

136
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,516
-Hank.
-What?

137
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,275
Sorry. You didn't see that.

138
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,875
So charming.

139
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,868
--clearly an ongoing operation.
One which was well-organised....

140
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,514
-Hank, how much money is that?
-lt's about 700 grand.

141
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,868
It was a pretty good haul.

142
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,833
As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens ofAIbuquerque...

143
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,712
...when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

144
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,831
Well, that's unusual, Isn't It?
That kind of cash?

145
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,270
Well, it's not the most we ever took.
It's easy money, till we catch you.

146
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,438
Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

147
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,835
You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

148
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,837
Get a little excitement in your life.

149
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,596
Yeah, someday.

150
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,711
Which one's this?

151
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,993
That faux-Lalique vase
I picked up at the Super-Swap.

152
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,755
How's It dolng?

153
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,952
Well, I met my reserve
and there's still two minutes.

154
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,392
What's up?

155
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,829
You tell me, birthday boy.

156
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,959
Oh, hey, so, what's up for Saturday?

157
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,313
Car wash.
Bogdan says he needs me.

158
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,637
-Tlll what time? Noon, 1-lsh?
-Probably 2, more like It.

159
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,115
And then what after that?

160
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,277
Actually...

161
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,232
...l was thinking of driving up
to Los Alamos. They've got this--

162
00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:00,068
The visitor centre has an exhibit on
that's really supposed to be--

163
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,918
-You're not gonna paint?
-No, I'll paint.

164
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,875
It's Just that this--

165
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,234
You know, this exhibition
on the Mars-rover photographs are....

166
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,671
I mean, the detail
really is just supposed to be amazing.

167
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,394
It's just that I really need you to paint
at some point.

168
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,636
The sooner that back bedroom
gets flnlshed....

169
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,794


170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,958
And I'd do it myself, except you don't
want me on the stepladder.

171
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,434
-I will paint.
-0kay.

172
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,318
-What Is goIng on down there?
-No, It's--

173
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,510
Is he asleep?

174
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,993
No, it's nothing. He's just....

175
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,191
You know. Well, you gotta be careful
about the baby and--

176
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,517
Well, don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

177
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:48,598
We are just doing you tonight.

178
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,718
So just close your eyes...

179
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,594
...relax, and let lt....

180
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,834
-Close your eyes.
-0h, okay.

181
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,798
Okay.

182
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,917
There you go.

183
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,752
That's It.

184
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,150
That's It.

185
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,908
There you go.

186
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,031
Keep It golng.

187
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,431
Keep It golng.

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,309
Keep It golng.

189
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,958
Keep-- Yesl Fifty-six.

190
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,750
This Is so embarrassing.
I am fine, honestly.

191
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,191
It's just some bug going around.

192
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,674
First, my wife had It, then my son,
and now me.

193
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,998
It's just-- It's just like a chest cold.

194
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,872
Could be some low blood sugar
as well.

195
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,231
I didn't have the greatest breakfast
this morning. Honestly, I didn't.

196
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,238
Hey, listen, can you do me a favour?
Can you just...

197
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,351
...drop me off at a corner
somewhere?

198
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,471
No, sorry.

199
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,548
It's just that
I don't have the greatest Insurance.

200
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,478
Take a couple of deep breaths
for me.

201
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,955
Is there anybody
you want us to contact for you?

202
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,275


203
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,549
Lean forward for me, would you?

204
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,711
-Mr. White, are you a smoker?
-No, never.

205
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,593
Why do you ask?

206
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,518
Mr. White?

207
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,112
Mr. White?

208
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,395
Yes?

209
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,595
You understood
what I've just saId to you?

210
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,713
Yes.

211
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,592
Lung cancer. lnoperable.

212
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,195
I'm sorry. I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

213
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,390
Best-case scenario, with chemo,
I'll live maybe another couple years.

214
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,671
It's just...

215
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,347
...you've got mustard on your....

216
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,718
Right there. You got mustard there.

217
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,398
Right there.

218
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,997
So my records show that I paid it...

219
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,078
...and I certainly don't feel
that we owe any late--

220
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,759
Yeah, all right.

221
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,191
Well, I'll check with the bank
and maybe the post office...

222
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:45,515
...if they lost it or something.

223
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,632
All right, then.
Yeah, let me look Into that. Okay.

224
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,875
Thank you.

225
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,353
Hey.

226
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,038
Hey.

227
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,757
DId you use the MasterCard
last month?

228
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,838
Fifteen eighty-eight at Staples?

229
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,357
We needed printer paper.

230
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,958
Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

231
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,318
Okay.

232
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,838
So how was your day?

233
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,712
Oh, you know.

234
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,717
I don't know. It was...

235
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,719
...flne.

236
00:19:57,719 --> 00:19:59,994
Hey, Walter.

237
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,553
Walter.

238
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,274
Walter. l'm shorthanded.
I need you outside to do wipe downs.

239
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,469
-Come on.
-What?

240
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,591
I said I need you
to do some wlpe downs.

241
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,029
Are you here to work,
or to stare at the skies?

242
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:13,036
Come on. Let's go.

243
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,239
Come on, man.

244
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:17,838
Fuck you, Bogdan.

245
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,669
-What?
-I said, 'fuck you.' And your eyebrows.

246
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,070
Wlpe down this.

247
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,957
Hank? Hank, it‘s Walt. Hey.

248
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,594
Oh, listen. I didn‘t wake you, did I?

249
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,994
Oh, good, good.

250
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:38,589
Oh, no, no.
Nothing's wrong. ljust....

251
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,557
I‘ve been thinking about
that offer of that ride-along.

252
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,990
It's the last house on the right.
See It?

253
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,111
Not the two-storey one,
the one next to It.

254
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,039
KInd of, I don't know
what do you call that?

255
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,799
-Green?
-Sage.

256
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,473
'Sage?'

257
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,830
Do you work at the fucking
Pottery Barn? Jesus.

258
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,109
Sage. That‘s the word for it.

259
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,117
My fault the only word
your dumb-ass knows is "green"?

260
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,197
"Cheese-dick." I know that one.
How about that?

261
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:10,154
Anyway, it's the sage one. See it?

262
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:12,788
So, what tells you it‘s a meth lab?

263
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,193
Just our snitch.

264
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,913
Says some dude who
goes by 'Cap'n Cook'...

265
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,632
...lives up to his name in there.

266
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,719
Says he always adds
a dash of chllll powder.

267
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,672
You exuberant Mexicans.

268
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,995
'Cap'n Cook?‘
That's a white boy's name.

269
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,235
Dopey as hell too.

270
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,317
Yeah? I'll tell you what.

271
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,953
I got you 20 bucks
that says he's a beaner.

272
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,354
-All right.
-You're on.

273
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,548
All right.
Come on, come on, come on.

274
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,393
All right. School bus is clear.
You got the green light.

275
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,113
Copy that.

276
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,789
Watch this. Makes them shit.

277
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,428


278
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,398
Meth labs are nasty on a good day.

279
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,750
You mix that shit wrong
and you got mustard gas.

280
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,915
Phosphlne gas.

281
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,750
-I think.
-Yeah, exactly.

282
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,394
One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

283
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,994
House is clear.
One suspect in custody.

284
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:15,429
Copy that. The suspect...

285
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,710
...mlght he be of
the Latino persuasion?

286
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,753
Driver's Iicence says
"Emiiio Koyama. "

287
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:25,077
-Aslan. Pay up, sucker.
-Hey, hey. First name, EmIlIo.

288
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,837
That's at least half a beaner.

289
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,712
Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10.

290
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:32,228
Cheer up, Gomey.

291
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,556
-You people still got J. Lo.
-Hank.

292
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,516
Do you think I might
get to go Inslde?

293
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,631
See the actual lab?

294
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,432
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell you what,
we‘re gonna go peek our heads in...

295
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:48,516
...check It out first.

296
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,314
Stay here a minute. Let's go, Frank.

297
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,758
Oh, God.

298
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,908
Oh, God.

299
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:29,393
Oh, my God.

300
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,759
Plnkman?

301
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,478
Cap 'n.

302
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,917
Hey. It‘s me. I‘m alone.

303
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,508
-How'd you find me?
-You're still In our filing system.

304
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:46,676
So your aunt owns this place, right?

305
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:47,948
I own It.

306
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,953
Look, no one's looking for you.

307
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,798
Why are you here?

308
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:57,115
l was curious.

309
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,075
Honestly, I never expected
you to amount to much....

310
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,830
...but methamphetamine.

311
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,510
I didn't picture that.

312
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,196
-There's a lot of money in it, huh?
-Don‘t know what you‘re talking about.

313
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:13,037
-No?
-Not a clue.

314
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,757
Cap'n Cook?

315
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,036
That's not you?

316
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,590
lee I said,
no one Is looking for you.

317
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,634
Look, I don‘t know what you think
you‘re doing here, Mr. White.

318
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,956
I mean, If you're planning
on giving me some...

319
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,391
...bull-winder about getting right
with Jesus or turning myself in.

320
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,353
-Not really.
-H|gh school was a long time ago.

321
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,837
You ain‘t Welcome back, Kotter,
so step off. No speeches.

322
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,711
Short speech.

323
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,197
You lost your partner today.
What's-hls-name.

324
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,877
Emlllo?

325
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,188
Emilio is going to prison.

326
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,115
The DEA took all your money,
your lab.

327
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,792
You've got nothing.

328
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,512
Square one.

329
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,275
But you know the business...

330
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,588
...and I know the chemistry.

331
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:15,589
I'm thinking...

332
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,870
...maybe you and I could partner up.

333
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,310
You wanna cook crystal meth?

334
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,919
You.

335
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,429
You and me.

336
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:40,072
That's right.

337
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,911
Either that, or I turn you in.

338
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,308
-What the hell Is this?
-Damned If I know.

339
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,510
I described it as mosaic folk art.

340
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,234
-And somebody bought it?
-Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

341
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,748
Fourteen dollars plus shipping. Yes.

342
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,792
At this rate,
In so or 60 years you'll be rich.

343
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,798
-So how goes the novel?
-lt's not a novel, actually, which l--

344
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,478
You're not writing a novel?

345
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,635
-You told me you were.
-No. Short stories.

346
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:21,273
I said that It eventually
I have enough good ones...

347
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,152
...that maybe I'll try...

348
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,758
...and publish another collection.

349
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,349
Those really didn't sell.

350
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:32,235
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

351
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,795
Yeah, well, maybe so.

352
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,233
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

353
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,878


354
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,353
I mean, I'm just not
at that stage where l....

355
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,076
-No.
-Open offer.

356
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,716
-So, what‘s up with Walt lately?
-What do you mean? He‘s fine.

357
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,717
He just seems...

358
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,750
...I don‘t know. Quieter than usual.

359
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:02,357
Turning 50 is a big deal.

360
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,108
I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

361
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,670
You're gonna be a basket-case.

362
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:17,269
-So It's a mid-life crisis.
-No. He's just quiet.

363
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,273
-How's the sex?
-Mar|e, Jesus.

364
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,112
I guess that answers that.

365
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,313
You just gonna sit there?

366
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,669
Look at this. Look at this.

367
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:20,316
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 millilitres. Very rare.

368
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,113
You got your usual paraphernalia,
Griffin beakers...

369
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:27,073
...there's your Erlenmeyer flask.
But the piéce de résistance...

370
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,716
...a round bottom boIlIng flask,
5000 mlllllltres.

371
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:37,278
I cook in one of those. A big one.

372
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,192
One of these?

373
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:43,951
No, this is an volumetric flask.
You wouldn‘t cook in one of these.

374
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,037
-Yeah. I do.
-No, you don't.

375
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,914
A volumetric flask is for
general mixing and titration.

376
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,792
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

377
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,751
That‘s what a boiling flask is for.

378
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,190
Did you not learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

379
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,311
No. You flunked me, remember?

380
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,669
-No wonder.
-Pr|ck.

381
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:07,189
And let me tell you something else.
This ain‘t chemistry.

382
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:09,276
Okay, this Is art.

383
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,959
Cooking Is art...

384
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,117
...and shit I cook Is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

385
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:16,674
Shlt you cook Is shit.

386
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,835
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.

387
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,553
You and I will not make garbage.

388
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,353
We will produce a chemically pure
and stable product...

389
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,675
...that performs as advertised.
No adulterants.

390
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:30,508
-No baby formula. No chilli powder.
-No, no. Chilli P's my signature.

391
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,835
Not anymore.

392
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,878
Yeah, well, we‘ll see about that.

393
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,435
-What the hell Is this?
-Lab safety equipment.

394
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:41,949
We‘re also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

395
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,674
These chemicals
and their fumes are toxic.

396
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,437
In case you didn‘t you know that.

397
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:49,676
Well, you can dress up
like a faggot if you want. Not me.

398
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,554
Listen, this stuff doesn't
stay more than a day.

399
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:02,831
-I thought we were gonna cook here.
-No, we‘re not gonna cook here.

400
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,873
Okay, this Is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

401
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,231
-Well, then where are we gonna work?
-You tell me.

402
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,910
This is your deal . You wanna smoke
it up, smoke it up at your house.

403
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,636
No, I didn‘t think so. Oh, well.

404
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,633
Well...

405
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,430
...what if we rented one of those
self-storage places?

406
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:26,312
You know, those little orange garages?
Worked out of there?

407
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:30,194
No, they‘re onto that.
They've got dogs that sniff around.

408
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,639
RV, that‘s what you want.

409
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,119
What, like a Winnebago?

410
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,759
Yeah.

411
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:46,916
I know a dude who wants to sell his.
He just goes camping with it.

412
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,394
But a mobile meth lab?
That'd be the bomb.

413
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,558
I mean, you can drIve way out
In the boonles.

414
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:54,798
Be all evaslve.

415
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:24,589
Dude, this isn't even seven grand,
all right? My guy wants 85.

416
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:27,518
This Is all the money
I have In the world.

417
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,070
You‘re a drug dealer. Negotiate.

418
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,988
You are not how I remember
you from class.

419
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,872
-I mean, like, not at all.
-Yeah, well, I gotta go.

420
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,433
Wait. Wait. Hold up.

421
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:42,876
Tell me why you're doIng this.
Seriously.

422
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,115
-Why do you do It?
-Money, malnly.

423
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:52,193
-There you go.
-No, come on, man.

424
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,708
Some straight like you,
glant stick up his ass...

425
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,071
...all a sudden at age, what, 60,
he‘s just gonna break bad?

426
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,556
-l'm 5o.
-lt's weIrd, Is all.

427
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:02,829
Okay, it doesn‘t compute. Listen...

428
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,507
...if you‘ve gone crazy or something...

429
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:09,348
...I mean, If you've gone crazy,
or depressed.

430
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,596
I'm just saying.

431
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,436
That's something
I need to know about.

432
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,710
Okay, I mean, that affects me.

433
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,231


434
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,074
What?

435
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,995
Buy the RV.

436
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,870
We start tomorrow.

437
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,991
How's it coming in there?

438
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,350
Flne.

439
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,634
Do you want me or your dad?

440
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,430


441
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,279
So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

442
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,629
You don't want to get them
If they're too tight.

443
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,912
They‘re-- They're pretty shrunk.

444
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,634
Are you sure you don‘t want the--
Like a different kind?

445
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,512
Like, you know, the skinnyjeans...

446
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,154
...because those are in style.
The skaters where them.

447
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,797
-Do I look like a skater?
-All right.

448
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,877
Mom, get them, my big boy pants.

449
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,149
Mommy, could you zip up
my bIg boy pants.

450
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,674
-Don't.
-What?

451
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:53,034
-Don't.
-Walt.

452
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:57,477
l have no Idea.

453
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,876
No, you know what?
Don't even look at them.

454
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,958
-They're obviously very stupid.
-Yep.

455
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,194
Yeah.

456
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,197
I think that-- I think those jeans
look really good on you.

457
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,039
I think you should get them
if you like them, okay?

458
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,037
Why don't you hang out here
for a second. I'll be right back.

459
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,195
Flne.

460
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:21,997
Hey, Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand new big boy pants.

461
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,117
-What are you doing?
-What‘s wrong? Having trouble walking?

462
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,913
Get off me! Get off me!

463
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,598
l‘ll mess you up, man.

464
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,950
You'll have one shot.
You'd better make It good.

465
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,595
You waiting for, your girlfriends?
Better go.

466
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,633
You'd better go. Take It.
Take your shot. Take It!

467
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,834
Come on.

468
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,391
-Come on.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

469
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,873
Let's go.

470
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,872
Psycho.

471
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,435
Yeah, nothing but cows.

472
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,791
Got some big cow house
way out that way, like two miles...

473
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,389
...but I don't see nobody.

474
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,957
-'Cow house'?
-Yeah. Where they lIve.

475
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,309
The cows.

476
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:50,398
Whatever, man.
Shit, yeah. Let's cook here.

477
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,992
Cow house.

478
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,868


479
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,433
-What are you doing?
-These are my good clothes.

480
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,594
You can't go home
smelling like a meth lab.

481
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:17,188
Yeah, you can. I do.

482
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,756
Those? Wow. Those....
You're keeping those on right?

483
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,155
Come on. Daylight's burning.

484
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,757
Oh, my God.

485
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:45,559
Wow, this is a good look for you.

486
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,877
I mean, you're maybe only
the world's second-biggest homo.

487
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,354
Would you shut up and help me?

488
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,990
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

489
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,556
-Work It. Baby, work It.
-Turn that off.

490
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,550
This Is glass-grade.

491
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,554
You got-- Jesus, you got crystals
in here two inches, three inches long.

492
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,272
This Is pure glass.

493
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,029
You're a goddamn artist.

494
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,194
This is art, Mr. White.

495
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,675
Well, actually,
It's just baslc chemistry...

496
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,518
...but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad It's acceptable.

497
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,358
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

498
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,200
Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu's
gonna want a taste.

499
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,350
-Man, I gotta try this.
-No. No.

500
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,195
No. We only sell it. We don't use it.

501
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:41,997
Okay, since when?

502
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,195
Listen, you've been watching
way too much Miami Vice.

503
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,549
That ain't happening.

504
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:53,198
So, what now?

505
00:41:54,999 --> 00:41:56,148
How do we proceed?

506
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,196
We cook more tomorrow.

507
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,032
Meantime...

508
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,709
...I know just the guy to talk to.

509
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,831
Get him. Come on.

510
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,632
Hey, yo. Kraze, how you doing,
my man?

511
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,799
Hey, you got a new dog.
Right on, man.

512
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,912
What's his name?

513
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,748
Yeah, I had a dog like that once,
except maybe like twice as big.

514
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,472
Super-purebred.

515
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,069
Now, me personally, I would train him
to go straight for the nutsack.

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,431

00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,550
Tell me that ain't the finest scante

520
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,749
Go ahead. Try It.

521
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,427
Hey, poochie. How you doing?

00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:22,598
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all....

529
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,914
And listen, homes, about that....

530
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,834
Really broke me up about Emilio.

531
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,437
That dude is like my brother.

532
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,513
-You okay? You talk to him?
-Yeah, I talk to him.

533
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,628
Said when the feds came, you were
out sticking it in some neighbour lady.

534
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,912
-Hey, you know, I got lucky twice.
-I don't know, man.

535
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,759


536
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,075

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,552
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
That Is bullshit.

538
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,350
That is bullshit, Krazy, eh?

539
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,073
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

540
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,995
You know what? Next time

541
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,791
...you tell him for me, all right?

542
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,712
Why don't you tell him yourself?
Made bail this morning.

543
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,673
Go ahead, pendejo. Kick my ass.

544
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,353
Hey, listen--

545
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,231
Where did you get this?

546
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,752
Because I know your little punk ass
didn't cook it.

547
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,672
Damn, man. What are you,
some kind of nudist?

I'd be willing to sell it to you...

551
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:09,598
...If the price Is right.

552
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:22,155
Out here all by yourself, huh?

553
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:33,358
Hey, I know you.
He was there when I got busted.

554
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:35,470
-He's with the DEA.
-No.

555
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:38,588
You rata snitch motherfucker.

556
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:40,227

557
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,672
I say we cap them both.

558
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,750
You really cook up that batch?

559
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,189
-Yeah.
-You an artist.

560
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,594
-lt's a damn shame.
-Wa|t.

561
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,118

00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,237
Listen to me.

563
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:18,509
What do you say?
You wanna cook like me?

564
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:23,636
You let us both live...

565

...and I will teach you, huh?

566
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,477
Put the cigarette out.

567
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,518

568
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,515
Move it, homes. You got all day?

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,434
Okay.

570
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:11,918
ShltI

571
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,033
What happened?

572
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,074
Hey, what'd you do to them?

573
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:04,508
Red phosphorus in the presence
of moisture and accelerated by heat...

574
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,949
...yields phosphorus hydride.

575
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,876
Phosphlne gas.

576
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:12,315
One good whiff and....

577
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:37,517
We gotta....

578
00:52:39,479 --> 00:52:42,596
We gotta clean this up.

579
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:29,631
Where were you?

580
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,193
Walt....

581
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,074
I don't know what's
been going on with you lately...

582
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,919
-...but--
-Noth|ng, honey. I'm fine.

583
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,159
Whatever it is, I'll tell you this.

584
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:54,791
I do not like It
when you don't talk to me.

585
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:58,992
The worst thing you can do
Is shut me out.

586
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,837
Walt....

587
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:51,477
Oh, Walt, is that you?
