1
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:35,912
All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,476
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning...

3
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,749
...we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,712
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,833
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,475
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,118
So study the face. Study the file.

8
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,594
Get a big old raging hard-on...

9
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,950
...at the Idea
of catching this place of shit.

10
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,755
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

11
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,635
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

12
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,318
All right.

13
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,350
On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,436
Reputed to have whacked
one 'Dog' Paulson...

15
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,392
...back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away...

16
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,078
...from the SoCal biker gangs.

17
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,555
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,230
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals...

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,954
...l'd say he Is a prime suspect
In the disappearance...

20
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,309
...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,355
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,470
We hauled Tuco In
for questioning on that...

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,113
...but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,788
Yeah, he runs a tight shlp.
Smug bastard.

25
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,756
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,039
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,958
We sure don't want It going on
up here...

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,878
...which brings us to the good news.

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,392
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,316
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,876
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,638


33
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:11,117
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body--

34
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,595
Elther hldlng It there
or pulllng It out. Not sure.

35
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,109
--when he got his arm crushed
clean off.

36
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,231
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

37
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,317
Anyway. The upshot is...

38
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,639
...we got us a nice, big, Juicy,
bloody flngerprlnt...

39
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:31,115
...which belongs to Senor Tuco.

40
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,755
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,269
That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,633
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

43
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,228
-Yes.
-Yes.

44
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,793
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,398
Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,672
-Do you wanna find this guy?
-Yesl

47
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,313
-Are we going to find this guy?
-Yesl

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,748
-Louder, damn ltl
-Yesl

49
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,790
-lee me a 'hell, yeahl'
-Hell, yeah!

50
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,637
-Hell, yeah!
-Hell, yeah!

51
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,195
Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.

52
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,038
They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,355
Guy is in MÃ©xico by now.

54
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,437
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,798
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

56
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,637
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,189
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's mlsslng.

58
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,391
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,432
Damn. You don't think he...?

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,879
Holler if you need me.

61
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:37,832
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,957
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so....

63
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,117
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,551
Without the hair.

65
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,318
Hey, It's me.

66
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,871
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,388
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,749
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,234
-What about height and weight?
-Five eleven...

70
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,476
...most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,913
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,838
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,156
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,589
What about
other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,994
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,034
-Anything that might help us.
-Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,958
That's fine.

78
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,911
-Is that the list of medications?
-Yes.

79
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,509
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,269
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,872
Has he been depressed?

82
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,434
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,274
Yeah.

84
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,590
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,868
Agitated?

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,358
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,109
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,514
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said:

89
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,159
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,073
Then he just walked out of the room--
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,838
l was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,952
--and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,638
Nothing else missing?

94
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,633
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,356
But-- What about the phone call?

96
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,748
I'm looking Into It.

97
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,716
-What phone call?
-Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,072
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,750
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

100
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,677


101
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,631
...couldn't that be...

102
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,636
...lmportant, right?

103
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,037
Anything else you can think of?

104
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,672
Anything else.

105
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,915
No. I called
the credit card provlders...

106
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:21,034
...and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,392
l-- Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

108
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,590
Every police station. Every morgue.

109
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,359
So, no, I really don't--
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,916
l was actually hoping
that you had something else...

111
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,508
...being that you're the expert.

112
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,113
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,593
No worries.

114
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,394
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,918
-Mrs. Whlte.
-Thank you.

116
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,428
-Walter.
-Thank you.

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,958
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran It.

118
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,990
-And?
-Never happened.

119
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,599
No record of It.

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,995
-Second cell phone.
-Yeah. I'm thinking.

121
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,353
I understand.

122
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,998
Out.

123
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,068
Get away from me!

124
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,035
Settle down, bltch.

125
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,358
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me In herel

126
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,755
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

127
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,915
That way, you have to clean it up!

128
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,074
It's your ride, retard.

129
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,111
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.

130
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,832
Get up.

131
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,278
Get up.

132
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,552
Oh, my God.

133
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,751
Don't do this, Tuco.

134
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,957
No more posters?

135
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,108
Walter Jr.'s making more.

136
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,596
Thank you, Marle.

137
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,913
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

138
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,510
I mean, he Just doesn't strike me
as the type.

139
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,277
He'll turn up.

140
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,114
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

141
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,709
-...I Just find It bewllderlng that...
-Marle.

142
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,673
-...you didn't believe that--
-Marle.

143
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,198
Not now.

144
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,232
Empty your pockets.

145
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,149
Thought your name was
Heisenberg...

146
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,033
..."Walter Hartwell White."

147
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,312
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

148
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:00,875
You know, a business name.

149
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,150
Yeah.

150
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,748
I like doing business
with a family man.

151
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,430
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,634
Answer me one thing.

153
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,115
Can I trust you?

154
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,390
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

155
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,671
Sit down.

156
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,871
DEA...

157
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,154
...hlt my place of business
this morning.

158
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,476
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

159
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,996
-You two haven't been talking, right?
-No.

160
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,552


161
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,432
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

162
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,553
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,715
That's weIrd, rlght?

164
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,229
I mean, don't you think
that that's welrd?

165
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,033
It's weIrd. Yes.

166
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,558
UnusuaL

167
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,037
UnusuaL

168
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,709
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

169
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,032
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

170
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,590
Explain to me.

171
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,675
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

172
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,156
I saw this coming.

173
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,789
I can see the future, you know?

174
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:34,470
It's this gift that l have
deep lnslde my head.

175
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,908
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

176
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,555


177
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,834
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

178
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,475
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

179
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,116
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skln hlm...

180
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,676
...and I'm gonna stuff hls hlde
for a heavy bag...

181
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:05,838
...and every time I hit him,
it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!

182
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,918
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

183
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,637
So you plan to Ice Gonzo,
llke, future tense?

184
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:23,674
What?

185
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,874
You're saylng, Tuco....

186
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,752
You're saying that Gonzo...

187
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:34,077
...ls currently operating
as a police Informant...

188
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,428
...as far as you know?

189
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,874
I'm very sorry to hear that.

190
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,791
That's disappointing.

191
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,354
Yeah.

192
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,392
-l'd waste him too, yo.
-Shut up.

193
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,919
Okay.

194
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,874
They're out there looking for me
right now.

195
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,752
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

196
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:59,918
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

197
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,548
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

198
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,629
No, It's-- It's klller.

199
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,313
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,558
So I was thinking last night.

201
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,317
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,877
-Mexlco?
-We'll dlsappear way out In the Jungle.

203
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,751
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:35,348
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,356
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us...

206
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,675
...because I got my people there.

207
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,597
Connections.

208
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:45,834
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

209
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,030
Tuco, l....

210
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,749
l have a wife and family.

211
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,996
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,079
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just...

213
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,554
...uproot my life like that.

214
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,636
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,198
Who's talking to you?

216
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,312
You need me, man...

217
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,557
...because I cooked that scante
In your hands.

218
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,712
Yeah.

219
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,432
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:25,358
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,595
Stink or no stlnk...

222
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,078
...one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:37,514
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,949
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,878
It klcks like a 12 gauge
when It comes on.

226
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,229
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,872
What secret ingredient?

228
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,757
Chili! powder.

229
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,039
I hate chilli powder.

230
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,798
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,908
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

232
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,033
We're gonna rewrite history
with this.

233
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,878
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,830
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,950
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,308
He's my partner.

237
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,388
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,556
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now...

239
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,432
...to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset...

240
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,949
...and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,358
And you....

242
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,392
You better hope they got room
In the trunk.

243
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,194
-Where are you going?
-Louis is taking me to the train station.

244
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,071
We'll put these up.

245
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,113
-No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
-He wants to help, let him help.

246
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,596
I mean, how long has It been
since you've slept?

247
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,717
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,238
For chrlssake,
you got a bun In the oven.

249
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,636
I got my cell if you need me.

250
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,831
-0kay?
-0kay.

251
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,715
-Bye, sweetIe. I'll see you later.
-All right. Bye.

252
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,836
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet...

253
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,791


254
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:02,031
Well, I mean, if he-- You know.

255
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,951
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,635
There's got to be something.

257
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,637
Some detaIl
that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:15,029
-What about the second cell phone?
-Jesus.

259
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:18,709
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:22,075
Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,158
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,555
There's no record of It
with the phone company.

263
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,389
No Incomlng,
no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,555
But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,714
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

266
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:48,313
Why? What sense would there be
In that?

267
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,431
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:56,951
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,116
What does it mean?

270
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,355
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,513
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,395
Everyone's got one from somebody,
bIg or little.

273
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,319
-Okay. Everyone. Okay.
-Skyler, come on.

274
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,273
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:23,878
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,389
So what?
What, Is he having an affair?

277
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,836
Walt? Please.

278
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,432
-What about the marijuana?
-He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,550
Says who? Hlm?

280
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,795
Chemotherapy
and marijuana go together...

281
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,753
...like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,431
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...

283
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:53,595
...and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,758
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,793
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,555
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,272
He may know something.

288
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,109
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:18,947
Then grasp.

290
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,991


291
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,911
HI, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,392
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,398
-Why?
-l'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,832
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,112
He taught your son chemistry
In high school.

296
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,517
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,234
-That was a long time ago.
-Yes, ma'am.

298
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,955
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,949
-Really?
-Yeah.

300
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:05,312
Mr. White must've seen
some potential In Jesse.

301
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,750
He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,235
He was one of the few teachers
who cared.

303
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:12,157
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,796
I'm so sorry
to hear about his Illness.

305
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:16,557
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,956
I certainly wIll,
as soon as he turns up.

307
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,308
He's missing, actually.

308
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,672
Just kind of walked off, or....

309
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:27,035
Anyway, which Is why
I'm going around...

310
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,753
...trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,597
That's terrlble.

312
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,994
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,033
Well, It you could put me In touch
with your son....

314
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,151
lee I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,239
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,399
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,398
I don't necessarily. ljust--

318
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,716
-Are you with the police?
-No, ma'am. Not at all.

319
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,793
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,474
Oh, my God.

321
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,714
Is my son In trouble?

322
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,274
l have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,869
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,547
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this...

325
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,068
...coming here and asking questions
about my son and--

326
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,589
Mrs. Plnkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:21,314
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,192
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:28,232
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,114
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...

331
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,709
...but I have not seen my son
In over a month.

332
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,151
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

333
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:42,875
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,875
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,278
ls Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,670
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education...

337
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:02,918
...as he has
on that rIdIculous bounclng car....

338
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,156
Low rlder, huh?

339
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,832
Gomey, hey.

340
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,758
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out...

341
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,951
...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...

342
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,391
...reglstered to a one
Jesse Plnkman.

343
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,592
Specifically, I wanna know
If the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,190
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,597
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

346
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,351
Chili! powder.

347
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,229
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

348
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,714
Whatever, man.

349
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,591
At least I tried something.

350
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,630
Hey, it almost worked too.

351
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,798
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

352
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:11,718
First you boost It,
then you leave It In your house.

353
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,512
My gun.

354
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,078
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

355
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,316
Well, at least he wants you alive.

356
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,667
Hey, I don't get It.

357
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:00,757
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who dId?

358
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,597
I don't know.

359
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,036
I don't know.

360
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:08,197
Does it really matter?

361
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,188
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant...

362
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,390
...who does he
automatically blame?

363
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,352
Us.

364
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,557
We need a plan.

365
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,830
-Th|nk, think.
-Let's just bum-rush hlm, man.

366
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,189
You crack him over
the head with something...

367
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,355
...and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,637
Crack him over the head
with something?

369
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,273
Hey, you got the c-bomb, man,
all right?

370
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,072
You're as good
as checked out already.

371
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:50,752
Just....

372
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,674
Oh, so my life
Is not the priority here...

373
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:58,313
...because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

374
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,237
That's your point?

375
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,358
Yeah.

376
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,797
We gotta get him to take this.

377
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,274
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chili! P.

378
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,232
That much has been established.

379
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:39,272
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump....

380
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,876
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

381
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,833
Go on, sIt. You're looking
a lIttle weak, Helsenberg.

382
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,156
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

383
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,797
Take It easy, â0.

384
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,108
lwIll feed you.
I eat flrst. That's the deal.

385
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,391
What?

386
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,671
I get It, I get It, I get It.

387
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,919
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

388
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,235
ltell you, Heisenberg.

389
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,267
Old people.

390
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,992
You feed them, huh?

391
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,713
You put them In a really nice crlb
In the country...

392
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,151
...and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

393
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,478
You better eat every bite of that.

394
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:00,388
What did you do that for?

395
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,431


396
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,115
Hey, look. Look.

397
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,878
There's nothing left.

398
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,709
What? What do you want?

399
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,078


400
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,397
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

401
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,794
Don't go there.

402
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,477
Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?

403
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,192
What, you don't like them?

404
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,389
One dlng.

405
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,634
Why don't you like them, Tio?

406
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,751
You don't trust them?

407
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,267
-Why don't you trust them, Tlo?
-Tuco, come on. He's....

408
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:23,274
There clearly some dementla.
He's not lucId.

409
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,838
Did they do something to you, Tio?

410
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:43,071
Something that you don't like?

411
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,668
What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?

412
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,108
Nothing. Nothing.

413
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:59,915
-Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
-I don't know. I swear. I don't know.

414
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,716
No, l-- Maybe it was-- I did change
the channel on his TV, but....

415
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,070
Yeah, that's It.
While you were cooking...

416
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,636
...he was watching
one of those telenovels...

417
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:13,353
...wlth all those rlpe honeys on It.
He was really Into It.

418
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,152
I told you
not to change the channel.

419
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,238
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's It.

420
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:27,475
Is that It, Tlo?

421
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,995
Is that It, Tlo?

422
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,993
Did they change your mamitas?

423
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,835
What are you telling me, Tio?

424
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,748
Are they punking me?

425
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,834
Hey. No.

426
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,315


427
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,918
-Come here!
-No.

428
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:13,509
No, no, Tuco.

429
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,958
Tuco, no. Tuco.

430
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,878
Shut up!

431
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:44,193
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

432
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,789
No, God. I don't wanna die.

433
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,876
Tell me what you did, Walter!

434
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,231
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

435
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,037
-Nol
-Tell me what you did!

436
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,789
We tried to poison you.

437
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,355
We tried to poison you...

438
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,039
...because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth...

439
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,116
...and you deserve to die.

440
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,116
Who's the bitch now?

441
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,670
Let him bleed.

442
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,432
The keys.

443
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,913
Tuco.

444
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,271
Oh, my God.

445
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,593
The couslns?

446
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,427
What the hell is going on?

447
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,557
Jesse Plnkman.

448
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,396
You're a hard man to find.

449
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,390
0h, shlt.

450
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,838
Easy.

00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:37,589
Oh, my God.

452
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:42,516
Oh, God. Hank.

453
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:44,072
-Who?
-Hank.

454
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,599
What?

455
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:47,437
-Oh, my God.
-What?

456
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,677
-Oh, my God.
-Stay. What are you doing?
