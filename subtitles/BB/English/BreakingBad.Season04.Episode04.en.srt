1
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,716
You want me to open the doors?

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,034
Here. The keys. Take them.

3
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,275
Why you talklng?

4
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,269


5
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:57,313
Gambling destroyed my life.

6
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:01,996
Me, my family, everything I loved.

7
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:06,027
It was Ilka a robbery,
only I was the thlaf.

8
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,955
It's amazing the stories you tell
yourself to justify it.

9
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:16,473
The lies that lead you
to just one more hand, one more spin...

10
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,478
...one more roll of the dice.

11
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,117
This is our deal, okay? Marie, no.

12
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,674
You guys are not llftlng a flngar.
I mean It.

13
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,435
Yeah, we're bringing everything. 80--
This is not up for debate, okay?

14
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,113
Great.

15
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,829
Sweetie, don't worry. We're not
gonna say one word about the bills.

16
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,155
We Just wanna brlng everyone
up to speed.

17
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,158
All right, I'll see you soon. Bye.

18
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,759


19
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,069
Tonight's the night. No turning back.

20
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,952
Well....

21
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,992
Okay. Let's do thla.

22
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,277
Okay. So first, I assign point values.

23
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,675
Correlate to the effect of removal.

24
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,116
-You're gonna apllt the elghta?
-8kyler, pleaae.

25
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,672
Now, the mathematical principle
known as the Kelly Criterion...

26
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,949
...upon whlch l devlaed
my own strategy--

27
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,070
Not dissimilar to the MIT system--

28
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,509
Walt, you're not teaching them.

29
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,990
-You wanted me to be thorough.
-Play. You're taking too long.

30
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,596
You don't think it behoves me
to be able to explain any of this?

31
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:32,190
lt behoves you to be a pro, that's all.
That's the fiction. So, chop-chop.

32
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,992
Don't chop-chop me.

33
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,757
Now, we both know
that the flrat declalon...

34
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,753
...la whether or not to apllt
or to surrender.

35
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,036
On eights. Split them.

36
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,999
Good on both.

37
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,879
Next decision is whether
to double down or not.

38
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,157
-Wh|ch you should be dolng.
-On an 11, yea. Double.

39
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,517
Okay, thla hand over here,
we have a soft 18.

40
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,793
The final decision is whether or not
to hit or to stand. Hit it.

41
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,354
-Becomea a hard 15.
-Dealer has a nlne.

42
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,073
I see that.

43
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,835
Hlt It.

44
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,638
Okay, let's see what I got.

45
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,071
And 21.

46
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,434
-Damn.
-Yup.

47
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,394
Okay, the key thing to remember here
is that it's not about any one hand.

48
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,676
The key la the number of hand:
per hour.

49
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,918
Let's go agaln.

50
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,949
Zero, mlnua one, 0.6.

51
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,275
Okay.

52
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,632
-Walt.
-lt'a not as If I don't know how to play.

53
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,033
I certainly more than understand
how to count cards.

54
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,474
Let's just keep going.

55
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,439
No, you know what?
I'm In recovery, remember?

56
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,398
I shouldn't even be playing.

57
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,315
And that is the fiction
that we should be sticking to.

58
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,039
You know what?

59
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,116
You're rlght. Yeah.

60
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:03,149
Okay.
We're not leavlng anythlng to chance.

61
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:07,591
All rlght. Let's get started.
Got a lot of....

62
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,351
-Walt. We got a lot of ground to cover.
-What is this?

63
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,030
We have to get our story straight.
We've gotta be on the same page.

64
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,918
-A scrlpt?
-Bullet polnts.

65
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,918
Bullet points? We got a novella.

66
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:25,271
This is smart. You really wanna try
to sell a DEA agent some...

67
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,868
...full-of-holes story
about how we suddenly...

68
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,035
...have enough money
to buy a car wash?

69
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,993
-Am I supposed to memorise this?
-We need to practise.

70
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,430
-We need to be word-perfect.
-W|th|n reason.

71
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,358
We need this story to be solid...

72
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,677
...and sympathetic
and, most of all, completely believable.

73
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,875
The story that you already told Marie.

74
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,116
You think that she hasn't told Hank?

75
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,794
Come on, thls |s Marle
we're talklng about here.

76
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,112
No, she hasn't. She hasn't.

77
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,914
Hank thinks his insurance is paying
for everything.

78
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:57,031
Marie's not telling him
we are paying his therapy bills.

79
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,470
-And nelther are we.
-And why Is that agaln?

80
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:03,632
-Really?
-If we have the gambllng story...?

81
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,275
Did you take money, Walt?
You remember Gretchen and Elliot?

82
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:12,630
I seem to recall that
you'd rather sell drugs than take help.

83
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,474
-F|ne.
-Marle wlll tell Hank In her own tlme.

84
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,910
And at least we'll have lald
the groundwork.

85
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,912
And comlng clean wlth Hank
and Junl--

86
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,079
Appearing to come clean
will be the best thing for everyone.

87
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,598
We talked about this.

88
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,190
-Okay? We agreed about thls.
-Yes, we dld. It's just....

89
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,392
What?

90
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,037
Never mind. Just--

91
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,067
Okay. So I really think we should
tag team the narrative, okay?

92
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,069
We'll each be responsible for certain
portions of the story and then we can--

93
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,192
We can hand off so we don't leave
anything out, and it'll seem natural.

94
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,232
Okay. So I'm gonna launch
wlth the excltlng news...

95
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,955
...that we are buying a car wash.

96
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,473
The next logical question
Hank will probably ask is:

97
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,911
"Where are you getting the money?"
To which I'll say:

98
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,912
We wanna tell you the whole story.
It's a doozy...

99
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,078
...so hold onto your hats.

100
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,437
Do you llke that?

101
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,238
Sure.

102
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,634
lt accomplishes two things. It keeps
it light while letting them know...

103
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,989
...to expect something big.

104
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:29,713
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

105
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,192
Okay. Anyway, that's where you will
take over, starting with your diagnosis.

106
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,629
Pages one and two. Okay. And it's--

107
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,668
It's pretty much gonna run parallel
to the truth, which makes it easier.

108
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,755
But just make sure
to really hlt the cancer.

109
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,950
Really touch on the fear and despair.

110
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,919
It's good to remind them
and to get their sympathy.

111
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,957
We want them to understand why
you could do something so stupid.

112
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,235
Now, after that, per pages three
and four, after you say:

113
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:01,676
"Gambling became an addiction
and I just couldn't control it."

114
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,232
-Do you see that?
-Yes.

115
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,628
In the middle. Okay.

116
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,634
I put in that line about robbery,
from the GA meeting. That was good.

117
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,469
So next, l'll chime in about how
it affected our marriage...

118
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,752
...starting with the confusion, the
deceit, why we couldn't tell anyone--

119
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,031
I'm terrlbly, terrlbly ashamed
of my actlons.

120
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,390
-Yeah.
-Two 'terrlbly's?

121
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,871
-lt's to show contrition.
-Well, I just wouldn't use that word.

122
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,799
I would never say
the word 'terrlbly.â€˜

123
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,588
Phrase it however you want. Okay?
You're jumping ahead. Now--

124
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,956
And why--?
And why am I so ashamed?

125
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,990
Do I really need to answer that?

126
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,869
l was, and am,
provldlng for our famlly.

127
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,273
-Let's just pick up where we left off.
-l'm weak, I'm out of control.

128
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,958
This makes me look like crap.

129
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,673
This has to be a warts-and-all story.

130
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,353
That's how we'll sell It.
We both look bad.

131
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,231
How do you look bad exactly?

132
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,198
Where Is the 'I slept wlth my boss'
bullet polnt?

133
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,317
I can't seem to find that anywhere.

134
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,678
For a flred schoolteacher
who cooks crystal meth...

135
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,269
...l'd say you're comlng out
pretty much ahead.

136
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,670
I don't llke It.
I don't want Junlor thlnklng less of me.

137
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,675
At least you won at gambling. I'm the
bitch mom who wouldn't cut you slack.

138
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,198
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,998
I'm sorry
that I put you through all of thls.

140
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,270
How's that sound?

141
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,157
Two 'sorry's.

142
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,989
I believe we were on page five.

143
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:53,393
So after you say how very sorry you
are, in your own words, of course...

144
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,999
...we're almost to the end.

145
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,193
And then I say how proud lam of you
forjoining a 12-step programme.

146
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,757
And this is where I think we should
enact how we're feeling, you know?

147
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,398
Just a suggestion. You might
look down at the floor with remorse.

148
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,919
What? You don't have to mean it.

149
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,588
You just stare down at your feet,
Walt, okay?

150
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,756
Then I'm gonna....

151
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:27,993
l was thinking of taking Marie's hand
and saying something emotional like:

152
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,838
It's such a relief to tell you.

153
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,719
We're glad we have a strong famlly
to help us.

154
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,272
That we can all support each other.
And then maybe I'll tear up a little.

155
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:41,789
I don't know. We'll just have to see
what happens in the moment.

156
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,032
You're gonna cry on cue?

157
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:48,117
-I said, I don't know. Maybe.
-When you dab your eyes...

158
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:51,038
...you gonna do It
wlth your rlght hand or your left?

159
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,277
-One tear? Two tears? How many?
-This has to be convincing.

160
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:57,437
Especially to Hank.
I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.

161
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,278
And yes, I'm thorough.

162
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:05,788
Maybe lying doesn't come
as easily to me as it does to you.

163
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,359
-Guysl Come on In! HII
-Hey.

164
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,675
-Good to see you!
-Hey.

165
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,638
-Hey, you llttle punkl Hey.

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,516
-You look good.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

171
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,672
Your Aunt Marie, she's cute,
but she could burn water.

172
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,916
You are so hilarious.
Show the boys your rock collection.

173
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,634
-We're gonna get organised.
-lt'll be 20 minutes.

174
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,717
-You have a rock collectlon?
-lt's a mlneral collectlon.

175
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,910
Just somethlng I've--
You wanna see It?

176
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,116
-Sure.
-All rlght. Let's go see It.

177
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,397
-Oh, hey, let me--
-Hey, no. l-- I got It.

178
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,676
Come on, guys. It's down the hall here.

179
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,117
Now, that one there, that's rhodonite.
Okay? lt's manganese inosilicate.

180
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,193
Cool. What makes It be
all plnk llke that?

181
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,319
Well, that's the manganese part. Okay?
lt oxidises, you know, like rust.

182
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,555
Manganese can have
an oxldatlon state...

183
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,955
...of between mlnus-three
and plus-seven...

184
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,549
...which takes it through a range
of colours. Purple, green, blue.

185
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,355
But its most stable state is plus-two,
which is usually pale pink.

186
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,713


187
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:40,518
Exactly. Whatever the hell he said.
Anyway, you get the idea.

188
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:46,112
Yeah, It's lnterestlng.
lnterestlng stuff, that. Really.

189
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,150

00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,398

194
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,508

195
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,109

Oh, man.
You can't make thls stuff up.

200
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,797
Who Is thls?

201
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:53,392
That, my friends, is Albuquerque's
public enemy number one.

202
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:03,194
It's such a relief to finally tell you.

203
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,632
We're just so glad that we have
a strong family to help us through this.

204
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,149
That we can all support each other.

205
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,669
Jesus. I don't even know where to--
Holy shlt.

206
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,511
Yeah.

207
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,994
Walter H. White.

208
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,516
Man of hidden talents.

209
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:32,075
Dad, you're such a stud.
How much did you win exactly?

210
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,831
-Dad?
-I don't thlnk l have exact flgures.

211
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,954
It's enough to-- After taxes, of course,
to buy the car wash.

212
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,313
Maybe even pay for...

213
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,472
...a couple of halfway reasonable
college educations.

214
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,477
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

215
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,348
I can totally get a car
for my blrthday now, rlght?

216
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:07,478
Son, I'm terrlbly, terrlbly
ashamed of my actlons.

217
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,479
Would you excuse me, please?
I need to use the restroom.

218
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,518
Walt?

219
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,354
Heyl

220
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,108
Sorry.

221
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,717
-Thought you mlght have fallen In.
-No, no, ljust....

222
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,150
Hey, man, that was some big stuff
back there.

223
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,153
No, we wanted to be thorough, so....

224
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:13,111
Yeah, well, it was quite a tale. Couldn't
have been easy to, you know...

225
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,232
...talk about.

226
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,238
You know, Walt, if you....

227
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,911
You can always bend my ear, right?
I mean, if you ever need to talk...

228
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,397
...or just blow off some steam,
I'm here.

229
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:31,750
Not going anywhere, so....

230
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:34,797
Thanks, Hank.

231
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,355
Same goes for me, you know. If you
ever wanna bounce anything off me...

232
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,198
...I don't know, casework,
anythlng, really.

233
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,635
Sometlmes just talklng
somethlng through...

234
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,479
...you know,
really can make a dlfference.

235
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,389
We're definitely not talking bathtub
crank here. This is a big-ass operation.

236
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,160
You know, hundreds of pounds a week.
Maybe more.

237
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,157
So who is this person?
What do you know about him?

238
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,833
Other than he's deader
than a Texas salad bar...

239
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,758
...and has a decent set of pipes?

240
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:16,110
-l'd say he's my guy.
-Your guy?

241
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,309
There's this mystery man I've been
chasing for the better part of a year.

242
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,670
Cooks the purest meth that me
or anyone else has ever seen.

243
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,467
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

244
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,708
Yeah. Pretty weird, huh?

245
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,789
I looked him up. It was one of these
physic-- One of Hitler's guys.

246
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:44,878
You know, a physicist named
Werner Heisenberg. Real cute, huh?

247
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,754
I figure with a handle like that,
my guy's gotta be some sort of....

248
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,520
Some sort of an egghead. No offence.

249
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,111
And here we go.
Gale 'Major Tom' Boettlcher.

250
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,953
Anyway, I just wanna see If I'm,
you know...

251
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,276
...not barking up the wrong tree,
chemically speaking.

252
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,828
As far as I can make out, he's writing
about a phenylacetone cook, right?

253
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,197
-Yeah.
-Yeah. That's pretty rare these days...

254
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:16,436
...but it does jibe
with the blue stuff I've been tracking.

255
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:21,349
"Two sticks dairy-free soy margarine,
two-third cup turbinado sugar."

256
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:28,078
It's a recipe for vegan s'mores.
There's all kinds of crazy crap in there.

257
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,959
Yeah, llke, you know,
top-ten recumbent blcycles...

258
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,672
...indoor composting tips.

259
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,993
All right next to the mother
of methamphetamine syntheses.

260
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:42,710
Thls guy was a....
Man, he was a real character.

261
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,956
Yeah, he seems unique.

262
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:48,667
Yeah. Let me show you somethlng.

263
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,678

264
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:01,034
'To W.W.
My star, my perfect sllence.'

265
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:03,436
W.W.

266
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,229
I mean, who do you figure that is?

267
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,870
Woodrow Wilson?

268
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,075
Wllly Wonka?

269
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,312
Walter White?

270
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,191
You got me.

271
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,029
W.W.

272
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,878
Wait a minute. Let me see this...

273
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,280
...for a second,
because I thlnk I remembered....

274
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:33,958
Here.

275
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,033
Yes.

276
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,148
Yeah.

277
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,715
'When I Heard

278
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,238
Learned.

279
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,077
And from time to time
Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.

280
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,555
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.

281
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,991
Your W.W.

282
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,909
You freaking brainiac.

283
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,632
You freaking brainiac.

284
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,397
I must have skipped that day
in school or something.

285
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,478
I been chasing my tail about that one.
Bet you're right.

286
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,512
-Well, I'm glad I could be of help.
-Yeah.

287
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,914

It looks llke you dld.

292
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,356
No, I mean, you know, me personally,
you know?

293
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,519
I wanted to be the one to slap
the handcuffs on him, that kind of shit.

294
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,236
Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.

295
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,678
If I recall, at least from the flrst
French Connection...

296
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:48,269
...Popeye Doyle never actually
caught hlm.

297
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:53,550
Yeah, I guess me
and old Popeye, huh?

298
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,995
Day late and a dollar short.

299
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,832
-What about the person who killed him?
-A.P.D.'s problem, not mine.

300
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,678
-Any leads?
-My buddy Tlm says...

301
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,473
...they got some flngerprlnts
they're trylng to ID.

302
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,716
Eyewitness saw a person of interest.
Might get lucky there.

303
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,355
Somebody knows something.
They'll track the shooter eventually.

304
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:20,237
Jesse.

305
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,998
Jesse.

306
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,553
What's up?

307
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,272
I need to talk to you.

308
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,993
Okay.

309
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,953


310
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,352


311
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,595
Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

312
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,037
I'm not done, yo.
And that dude's next.

313
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,194
-What the hell? What is wrong--?
-We have business to discuss.

314
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,594
So dIscuss. Jesus.

315
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,118
Let go of me.

316
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,788
Gale's murder is being investigated.

317
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,677
And I have it on good authority that
they found fingerprints at the scene.

318
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,671
Not mlne.

319
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,913
-We done here?
-No, we are not done here.

320
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,587
What If they are yours?
How can you be so sure?

321
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,355
Because I'm here. Your brother-in-law's
got such a hard-on for me...

322
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,676
...if the cops found my fingerprints--

323
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,150
If the cops found my prints
within five blocks of that place...

324
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,510
...they would've plcked me up
by now.

325
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,751
What about the casing?

326
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,871
-Oh, my God.
-Or caslngs?

327
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,792
How many tlmes

328
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,673
Jesse, did you pick up the casings?

329
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,275
Did you pick them up?

330
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,469


331
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,438
Yeah, well....

332
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,595
Listen, we gotta go over this
step-by-step, everything.

333
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,871
Tell me exactly what happened
from the moment you got there.

334
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,115
-I got In, I got out.
-No.

335
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,869
No, I need to know specifics.
Now, we'll start from the beginning.

336
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,232
Jesse, I need you to concentrate.

337
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,954
Thls Is very Important.
DId you knock or rlng?

338
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,475
Knock or rlng?

339
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,148
Knock.

340
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,432
Good, good. That's very good.
Now, llsten.

341
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,951
Assume that Gale answered the door.
What happened after that?

342
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,434
Did he recognise you?

343
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,675
Did you say anything to each other?

344
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:04,633
Did you walk into the room or did you
shoot him right then and there?

345
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,068
What?

346
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,355
-Who wants to make a hundred bucks?
-Yeah.

347
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,432
Look, the kid's probably right.

348
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,229
If they had anything on him,
he'd be locked up already.

349
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,908
What about my brother-in-law?
He suspects Jess--

350
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:40,431
Hell, he knows Jesse is involved
in the sale of blue meth.

351
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:45,589
That was Hank's one-and-only lead.
What if he puts two and two together...

352
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,949
...and he goes after Jesse
for the murder?

353
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,151
Goes after hlm how,
on hls Rascal scooter?

354
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:55,712
That perhaps sounded insensitive.

355
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,873
But if he goes after him,
I'll sue his ass for police brutality...

356
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,310
...harassment,
assault and 16 other thlngs.

357
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,875
No, history those two have together,
being what it is...

358
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,153
...gotta figure your brother-in-law's
smart enough not to go down that road.

359
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,029
Goose egg. Bubkes.
That's what the cops got.

360
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,230
I wouldn't worry about it.

361
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:19,397
Yeah, what else should I
not worry about, Saul?

362
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,479
Should I not worry that Gus plans to
murder me at the first chance he gets?

363
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,150
That my drug-addicted partner doesn't
seem to care whether he lives or dies?

364
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,150
You should see hls house.
It's llke skld row.

365
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,193
He has actual hobos living there.

366
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,716
Now, how long before Gus decides
that he's too big of a risk?

367
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,674
Jeez, I got Mike,
that grunting, dead-eyed cretin...

368
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,232
...sucker-punching me in the face.
I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.

369
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:53,990
I mean, Western Unlon,
message recelved.

370
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,871
Let me ask you.
When did this stop being a business?

371
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,756
Why am I the only person capable
of behaving in a professional manner?

372
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,312
No, any way you sllce It,
everyone Is In danger.

373
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,958
I mean, how can I protect anyone?

374
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,719
My family, Jesse, myself?

375
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,307
My name never comes up
with those guys, does it?

376
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:30,317
And meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash.

377
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,513
Oh, yeah.
That shlp has saIIed, bon voyage.

378
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,473
We are committed.
We already told our family about it.

379
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,477
And now Skyler,
I'm sure she belleves--

380
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,036
She needs to believe
that everything is neat and tidy.

381
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,954
And she's telling herself that
I work in this nice, quiet little lab...

382
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,719
...wlth a whlte lab coat
and a pocket protector...

383
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,275
...and when my contract is up,
I'll just simply hang it all up...

384
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,391
...tip my hat and walk away.

385
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,237
Oh, God.

386
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,400
How dId everythlng
get so screwed up?

387
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:12,675
Yeah, you do have a little
shit-creek action happening.

388
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,876
You know, FYI,
you can buy a paddle.

389
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,959
Thls Is a last-resort,
back-pocket klnd of thlng...

390
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,596
...but if you really gotta protect
yourself, disappear....

391
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,555
There's a guy who can make it happen.
They call him a "dissapearer."

392
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,992
For a substantial fee,
and I do mean substantial...

393
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,079
...you and your loved ones can vanish.
Untraceable.

394
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,833
I mean, he sets you up
wlth a whole new llfe.

395
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,838
What, llke a wltness protectlon
klnd of thlng?

396
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,230
Beyond. I mean, off the grid.

397
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,712
New identities, new everything.
No one would ever be able to trace you.

398
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,713
Now, be clear. This is an end game,
if you get my meaning.

399
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,194
I mean, there's no coming back.

400
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,153
So you want his card?

401
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,633
God, there's gotta be something else
that I can do.

402
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,996
Some way to keep everything
from spiralling out of control.

403
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,758
Well, from what you told me...

404
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,873
...it sounds like Pinkman is first up
in the imminent-demise department.

405
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,075
Gus won't rlsk
lettlng the pollce flnd Jesse.

406
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,554
I know him. He won't.

407
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,029
I'm not kidding. If you really
think about it, you can't even see it.

408
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:16,151
How can you know how bad
radio frequencies, microwaves...

409
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,157
...and cell phones are getting you?

410
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,591
You could be strolling
through security at the airport--

411
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,153
Hey, wake up, bitches.

412
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,954
You get waved through a full-body
x-ray scanner.

413
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,277
Next day, you could be dead or dying
from all the radiation they say is safe.

414
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,109
But there's no way it could be.
It has to deliver a concentrated dose.

415
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,753
Enough to penetrate clothes.

416
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:39,634
The accumulated amount could be
dangerous to susceptible individuals...

417
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,910
-...especlally from a rural area.
-Yo.

418
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,031
The ozone layer is already thin
because of the cow farts.

419
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,594
-YoI
-Oh, hey.

420
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,114
Make sure there's plzza here
when I get back.

421
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,788
-All rlght? Enough for everybody.
-Oh, yeah.

422
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:55,593
I can do that. I can definitely do that.

423
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,791
Not a problem.
I can get the stuff, the pizza and stuff.

424
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,957
But as far as the flnanclal sltuatlon,
you know....

425
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,268
-Just hang on. Hang on.
-Yeah, yeah.

426
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,199
And you know,
the concentrated doses...

427
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:17,677
...it's gonna fuck with your bone
marrow and it's gonna mess up....

428
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,559
Because-- Because especlally
If you have cancer.

429
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:35,956
You know, because if you gotta get
a bone-marrow transplant...

430
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,516
...your odds are 60 percent.
You got a 60 percent chan--

431
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,152
Hey.

432
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,430
Hey, hey.

433
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:48,391
Get some dipping sticks too, yo.

434
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,319
Yeah, I can deflnltely get
dlpplng stlcks.

435
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,517
All right. I can get them.

436
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,828
Hey, smoke it up, bitches.

437
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,991
Gotchal

438
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,479
Wake up.

439
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,593
Wake up.

440
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:44,677
What's up?

441
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,395
What's up with your ear?

442
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,318
Downstairs. Now.

443
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,388
Where is everybody?

444
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,238
I invited your guests to leave.

445
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,710
Know who this is?

446
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,353
-Nope.
-You ought to.

447
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,676
He's been at your house
for three solld days.

448
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,029
Okay.

449
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,911
He stole your money.

450
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,838
Okay.

451
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,519
That $78,000 or so look familiar?

452
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,280
-Thls Is It?
-That's It.

453
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,396
Okay. Thanks.

454
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,351
Wanna know what's next for
Little Miss Pissed-in-His-Pants?

455
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,152
-No.
-You sure, now?

456
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,512
-Yep.
-Don't even wanna take a wlld guess?

457
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,509
You're gonna kill him.

458
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,230
Is this the part where
I'm supposed to beg you not to do it?

459
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,794
Oh, please, please.

460
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,711
And then what?

461
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,998
I'm supposed to promlse,
cross my heart...

462
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,872
...to stralghten up and fly rlght
or toe the HM...

463
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,434
...or some other crap
that I'm not gonna say?

464
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,677
Is that what your little show here
was all about?

465
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:17,951
You're on thin ice, you little shithead.
You know that?

466
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,239
You aln't gonna smoke
that dude In there.

467
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:25,031
You know how come I know?

468
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:29,118
Because you went through the trouble
of putting a blindfold on him.

469
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,030
I'm going back to bed.

470
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,350
Let yourselves out.

471
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,235
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

472
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,716
-How's the ear?
-Mendlng.

473
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:03,238
What can I do for you?

474
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,997
It's Plnkman.

475
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,394
He's become increasingly incautious.

476
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:10,553
He's a rlsk. A lIabIlIty.

477
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,032
I know he and Walter come as a team
and that Walter won't like it...

478
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,953
...but something's gotta be done.

479
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,032
You gotta be kidding.

480
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,912
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

481
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:07,794
nght.
Thls Is message number three.

482
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:12,238
You'd better be ready in two minutes,
because I am right outside your door.

483
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,558
Jesse.

484
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:21,512
Jessel

485
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,353
Damn It.

486
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,197
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

487
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,674
Oh, great.

488
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,838
Jessel

489
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,632
Thls Is perfect.

490
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,909
You are a pIece of work,
you know that?

491
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,832
Jesse?

492
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,909
Jesse.

493
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,873
Jesse?

494
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,312
Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.

495
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,757
Where Is he?

496
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,949
