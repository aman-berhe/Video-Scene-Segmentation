Why buy a starter house when we'll

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,395
Dld you wln the lottery

-You get your car l'lxed?
-Not yet.

70
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,509
You're gonna wanna

-Has It grown worse?
-Not that I know of, no.

75

-l'm qulte well, thank you.
-No. Clearly, you are not.

78
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,110
No ratlonal person would do

79
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,993
Explaln yoursell'.

80
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,749
My partner was about
to get hlmsell' shot.

81
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,353
l lntervened.

82
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,874
Some worthless Junkle.

83
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,033
For hlm, you Intervene
and put us all at rlsk.

84
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:59,874
Some contemptlble Junkle who couldn't
keep the peace for elght hours.

85
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,395
That's rlght. He couldn't.

86
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,989
He was angry
because those dealers of yours...

87
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,230
...had Just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

88
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,197
I heard about It.

89
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:12,032
He should have
let me take care of them.

90
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,872
Maybe.

91
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:18,033
Then agaln, maybe he thought
It was you who gave the order.

92
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,271
Are you asklng me
It I ordered the murder of a chlld?

93
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,359
I would never ask you that.

94
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,512
Where Is Plnkman now?

95
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,550
I wouldn't know.

96
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:45,117
Couple of tlme zones away, at least.

97
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,557
Beyond that, I'd only be guesslng.

98
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,998
He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep movlng.

99
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,673
You'll never l'lnd hlm.

100
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,671
I don't know, Walt...

101
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,919
...lt's what I do, after all.

102
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,757
He's out of the plcture.

103
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,833
I saved hls lll'e, I owed hlm that,
but now he and l are done.

104
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,072
Whlch ls exactly what you wanted,
Isn't It?

105
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,717
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatlc man.

106
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,235
So It I may,
I would llke to revlew optlons wlth you.

107
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,153
Ol' whlch, It seems to me,
you have two.

108
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,236
Optlon A:

109
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,197
You klll me rlght here and now.

110
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,194
Apparently,
I have made that very easy for you.

111
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,873
You can klll me, no wltnesses...

112
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,715
...and then spend the next few weeks
or months...

113
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,598
...tracklng down Jesse Plnkman
and you klll hlm too.

114
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,992
A polntless exerclse, It seems to me,
but that Is optlon A.

115
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,752
What Is optlon B?

116
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,273
l contlnue cooklng.

117
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,195
You and I both forget about Plnkman.

118
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,554
We l'orget thls ever happened.

119
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,280
We conslder thls a lone hlccup...

120
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:03,069
...In an otherwlse long
and l'rultl'ul buslness arrangement.

121
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,029
I prefer optlon B.

122
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,515
You'd need a new asslstant.

123
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,795
-I could get rlght on that.
-No.

124
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,109
Thls tlme, I choose.

125
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,238

126
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,038
...get It l'lxed.

127
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,713

204
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,915
Can I offer you somethlng?

I'm sorry for the lnconvenlence.

207
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,479
Oh, no, no. It's no lnconvenlence.

208
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,313
I need to talk to you
about somethlng.

209
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,834
Somethlng rather presslng.

210
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,429
II' push came to shove,
l was wonderlng...

211
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,353
...how soon you mlght be able
to take over the lab yoursell'.

212
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,636
You and an asslstant.

213
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,957
Why would...?

214
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,153
-Why would push come to shove?
-Has Walter ever talked to you...

215
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,790
...about why he got Into
thls partlcular llne of work?

216
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,159
I guess I assumed
It was because It pays so well.

217
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,880
It Is, but specll'lcally...

218
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,918
...has he ever spoken to you
about hls health problems?

219
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,672
I'm not surprlsed.
He's a very prlvate person.

220
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,032
What exactly
are hls health problems?

221
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,350
He's dylng of cancer.

222
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,594
It Is why he does thls, to provlde I'or
hls I'amlly, whlch he's accompllshed.

223
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,788
They wlll never want for anythlng,
he's seen to that.

224
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,314
How long does he have?

225
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,433
That Is very much the questlon.

226
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,793
He does not wanna talk about It.
And every tlme l brlng It up wlth hlm....

227
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,228
I don't know that he's l'ully accepted
the reallty of It.

228
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,995
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am runnlng a buslness here.

229
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,990
-No, I understand.
-I have a very large Investment In thls.

230
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,197
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

231
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,712
Not even for a week.

232
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:35,155
So you understand my concern.

233
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,278
And my deslre for contlnulty.

234
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,839
I do. Absolutely.

235
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,073
Now, I lntend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants...

236
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:47,993
...assumlng that
he's physlcally up to It.

237
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,678
But as he cannot or wlll not tell me
how long that mlght be...

238
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,515
...I must prepare
for the worst-case scenarlo.

239
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,668
Well, worst-case scenarlo....

240
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:10,552
I suppose If we had...

241
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,878
...at least a few more cooks together.

242
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:17,076
You don't thlnk you're ready now?

243
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,355
Well, I mean...

244
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,953


245
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,228
A master.

246
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,548
There's always more for me to learn.

247
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,275
But I'm thlnklng that If we had...

248
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,112
...say...

249
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,471
...OIII or two more cool“.

250
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,036
One more...

251
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,955
...I guess would do It. I suppose.

252
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,469
l belleve ln you, Gale.

253
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,999

00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,994

255
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,909
Walt, Is there...?

256
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,072
Any partlcular trlck

257
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,830

258
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:03,277
Yeah?

259
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,630

wlth an address.

262
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,396
-Wh|ch cllent?
-Jesse Plnkman.

263
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,553
Jesse-Plnkman-ln-the-phone-book

264
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:29,109
How would one track hlm down,
I wonder.

265
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,911
-You're stlll here.
-I need your full attentlon, Saul.

266
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,156
Jesse Plnkman.
Current whereabouts.

267
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,869
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever thls ls.

268
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,191
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monltor?
Current whereabouts.

269
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,308
-Let me tell you somethlng, Mlke, you--
-Whoa, you are good rlght there.

270
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,513
Now, let's both get comfortable.

271
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,349
Now, when I say,
I'm looklng for Plnkman...

272
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,750
...we both know why, don't we?

273
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,153
You pretendlng otherwlse only wastes
my tlme and serves to annoy me.

274
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,753
Look, Mlke...

275
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,558
...there are rules to thls lawyer thlng.

276
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,710
-Is that rlght?
-Yeah.

277
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,154
Attorney-cllent prlvllege.
That's a blg one.

278
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,389
That's somethlng l provlde for you.

279
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,357
So If I glve up Plnkman...

280
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,875
...then you're gonna be asklng,
'Saul glves them up pretty easy.

281
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,508
What's to keep hlm
from glvlng me up?' You see?

282
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,557
So then, where's the trust?

283
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,989
I trust the hole In the desert
I'd leave you In.

284
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,477
Yeah, that's an argument.

285
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,556

00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,832
...don't make me beat you
tlll your legs don't work.

287
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,153
Now tell me where to flnd hlm.
You know It's the rlght thlng.

288
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:55,348
I can't tell you, Mlke, all rlght? l....

289
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,269
Look, If I was to tell you, well, l]ust--
I couldn't llve wlth myself.

290
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,078

291
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,795
But who's to say I dldn't wrlte

292
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:12,315
Or on a scratch plece of paper

293
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,313

00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,757
At least untll they klll me
and Gale takes over.

327
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,391
-So he's thelr boy, huh?
-He's thelr boy.

328
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,869
How long you thlnk you've got?

329
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,998
Well, he asks a lot of questlons
about the cooklng process.

330
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,153
I try to be as vague as posslble,
but I got that guy Vlctor watchlng me...

331
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,788
...llstenlng to every word I say.

332
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,075
You know, maybe that the only thlng
savlng me Is Gale's fastldlousness.

333
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:33,994
And once he feels confldent
that he knows my entlre method....

334
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,157
So, what do we do?

335
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,909
You know what we do.

336
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,592
There's got to be some other way.

337
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,709
Maybe It's better for you
to Just go to the cops.

338
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:07,907
All rlght? I mean,
I can't belleve I'm saylng that and all...

339
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:09,990
...but for your famlly.

340
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,073
The DEA would love you,
all the shlt you could tell them.

341
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:17,151
Federal wltness protectlon,
that's a good deal.

342
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,075
As for me, I'll hlt the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make It.

343
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,552
We had a good run.

344
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,630
But It's over.

345
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,635
Never the DEA.

346
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,552
The cook can't stop.

347
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:42,871
That's the one thlng I'm certaln of,
productlon cannot stop.

348
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,235
Gus can't afford to.

349
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,837
So If I'm the only chemlst
that he's got...

350
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,118
...then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me allve.

351
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,556
It keeps you allve too.
lthlnk I can see to that.

352
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,032
If I'm the only chemlst that he's got.

353
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,993
I can't do It, Mr. Whlte.

354
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,469
lee you sald, l'm....

355
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:21,430
I'm not a....

356
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,916
I can't do It.

357
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,196
I'll do It.

358
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,076
I'm gonna need your help.

359
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,390
I mean,
they're watchlng me day and nlght.

360
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,676
They never leave me alone wlth Gale,
not for a moment.

361
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,354
Hell, I don't even know
where the man llves.

362
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,156
He's not In the phone book,
I can't flnd hlm on the Internet...

363
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,915
...and I can't do It In the lab,
Vlctor's always there.

364
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,836
But If I could Just...

365
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:00,878
...shake Vlctor,
for even an hour one nlght...

366
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,349
...l thlnk then that....

367
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,035
I may be able...

368
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,235
...to make It look llke an accldent.

369
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:16,556
There's got to be some other way.

370
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,469
I'm all ears.

371
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:24,350
But when It comes down to you and me
versus hlm, I'm sorry.

372
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,995
I'm truly sorry...

373
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,114
...but It's gonna be hlm.

374
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,588
Now, you are the only edge
that I've got...

375
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,558
...as long as they don't know
that you're ln town.

376
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,950
But I need you to track hlm,
get me hls address.

377
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,189
And I'll do the rest.

378
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:53,472
Look, I saved your llfe, Jesse.

379
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,115
Are you gonna save mlne?

380
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,674

No. Looks pretty much wIde-open.

388
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,115
When are you gonna do It?

389
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,877
Tonlght.

00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,110
Once It gets dark.

00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,156
Don't do thls, Mr. Whlte.

392
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,313
