00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,350
We Intercepted a call between hlm

137
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,993
You know, your employer?

138
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,998
Anyway, In the call, Walt sald

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,555
'Take care of one Jesse Plnkman,'
unquote...

140
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,718
...and that you were next on the hlt llst.
That's why you're here.

141
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,876

143
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,828
Your assoclate, Goodman's l'lxer--
What's hls name?

144
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,031
Some carrottop named Patrlck Kuby.

145
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,595

00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:24,237
Walt sald he was gonna do thls Kuby

148
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,351

153
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,314
-The hell you talklng about?
-Don't take It personally.

154
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,431
Goodman's next on the chopplng block
II' he doesn't do what Whlte says.

155
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,110
To be l'alr, your clrcus clown of a boss

...bel'ore he declded

158
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,153
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone...

159
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,792

...Walt wlll l'lnd out

166
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,190
Tell us everythlng you know

167
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,117
Why would he wanna klll me?

168
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,356
-l aln't do nothlng.
-Who knows wlth thls guy?

169
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,391
From what he sald,
It may have to do...

170
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,078
...wlth hlm tylng up loose ends...

171
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,588
...regardlng polsonlng
some kld named Brock.

172
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,673
Or maybe It's because
you know where hls money ls.

173
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,559
I don't know where hls money ls.

174
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,954
That aln't what we heard.

175
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,195
You aln't llstenlng
to the people In the know.

176
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,230
Me and Kuby rented a van
for the dude...

177
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,000
...loaded hls cash up
In a self-storage unlt...

178
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,589
...handed over the keys to hlm

179
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,869
Who knows where he took It
from there?

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,548
A van, huh?
How much money we talklng?

181
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,679
Seven barrels' worth.

182
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,154
Seven barrels?

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,549
When you say 'barrels,'
you mean 'barrels' barrels?

184
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,709
Barrels, man. You know,
plastlc, black, 55-gallon type.

185
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,147
I got them at Home Depot.

186
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,714
Fllled up every last damn

187
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,876
And where dld you rent the van?

188
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,675

189
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,279
-Larlat on Candelarla?
-Yeah.

190
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,596
Kuby rented the van.
Mr. Whlte dropped It oft.

191
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:26,267
He had us wash It good
before Kuby took It back.

192
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,594
Wash the rental? Why?

193
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,472
It was l'llthy, man,
llke he went oft-road wlth It.

194
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,477
After we had hosed It down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back...

195
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,240
...handed over the key,
and that was It.

196
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,634
That's all I know.

197
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,228

00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,150
And remember, no phone calls.

00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,839

205
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,275

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,233

210
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,556
...the better he can protect you.

211
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,039
How long you gonna be?

212
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,268
As long as It takes to keep you safe.

213
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,189
So Just one guy thls tlme.

00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:45,198

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,515
Yeah.

217
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,676

00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,197
Rat patrol? No. No, he's not a rat.

221
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,311
He's Just....

222
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,196
He Just won't llsten to reason.

223
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,391
-0kay.
-He's Just angry.

224
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,078

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,356

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,432
Jesse Is llke l'amlly to me.

232
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:42,237
Look, I want what you do
to be qulck and palnless.

233
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,237
No sufl'erlng, no fear.

234
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,272
Bullet to the back of the head.
Somethlng he doesn't see comlng.

235
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,149
I respect that.

236
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:52,431
-There's too many savages out there.
-Let's Just talk about the money.

237
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,755
No, we don't want your money.

238
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,839
We want you to cook for us.

239
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,270
You know I'm out of the buslness.

240

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,476
...lt's all the craze

00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,549
-So I'm told.
-No. Absolutely not.

Look, what was the prlce per head

248
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,234
Don't sklmp on l'amlly,

00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,594
...after the Job Is done.

253
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,190

00:17:28,999 --> 00:17:31,115


277
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,833
Froot Loops.

278
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,677
That's good stuff.

279
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:37,794
So Jesse....

280
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,227
Yeah, I....

281
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,633
I don't wanna alarm you...

282
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,229
...but I've been trylng
to reach hlm for days.

283
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:44,633
I've stopped at hls house...

284

00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,591
...and he won't return my calls.
I can't flnd hlm anywhere.

286
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,153
Have you heard from hlm?

287
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,828
No, not slnce the last tlme
he called to check on Brock.

288
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,429
That was, I don't know,
two weeks ago, maybe.

289
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,798
Andrea...

290
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,711

Or a better Idea.

294
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:19,276
Jesse's lawyer's name Is Saul Goodman.
l have hls card somewhere.

295
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,870
I mean, he may have ways of flndlng
Jesse wlthout gettlng hlm In trouble.

296
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,117
'Better call Saul.' Yeah. l-- l dld that.

297
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,515
He was able to verlfy
that Jesse's not locked up...

298
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,679
...but, otherwlse, very llttle help.

299
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,718
You see, the thlng ls...

300
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,877
...Is that Jesse and I
had thls argument recently.

301
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,073
And I won't bore you
wlth the detalls, but he's....

302
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,716
He's-- He's pretty upset wlth me and....

303
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,513
And I'm hoplng that's the reason
he hasn't called me back...

304
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,395
...lnstead of hlm belng....

305
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,071

306
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,431
Well, I'll try hlm rlght now.

307
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:05,472
I mean, If that's It, he's mad at you...

308
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,274
-...maybe I'll have better luck.
-That would be such a help. Yes.

309
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,278
What--? What--?

310
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,075
-H|s cell.
-You know, he recently got a new one.

311
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,997
And there. That--

312
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,317
That's hls new number there,
the hlghllghted one.

313
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,989
Jesse, hey, It's Andrea.

You're welcome to stay a few mlnutes

323
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,033
No, no, no. You're trylng to get
your son off to school.

324
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,628
If he does happen to call back,
would you call me?

Better yet, I've got your number.

No GPS. Nope.

343
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,555
They used to have GPS
untll about slx months ago...

344
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,989
...when the ACLU or somebody
sued them...

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,918
...and they had to get rld of It.

346
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,596

There's a whole lot of desert out there.

355
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,069
You sald It yourself,

356
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,589
Yeah. But Walt doesn't know that.

...you tally the total

So say we sold, I don't know,
10 plne-scented alr fresheners.

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,835
You mark '10' under thls column...

429
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,189
...and then you subtract 10
from the stock column.
