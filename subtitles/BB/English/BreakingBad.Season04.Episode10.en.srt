1
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,555
You can do thll.

2
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,558
You have reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

3
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,911
...number, and the reason for your on".
Thank you.

4
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,791
Thlrd try.
Watt, If you're there, please plck up.

5
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,229
[really wanted to do this together
but I can hear him getting up.

6
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,193
It's not like I can keep him
from seeing the thing.

7
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,075
So, I'm sorry, but I've waited
as long as possible and |....

8
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,839
I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead
wlthout you.

9
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,555


10
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,674
Thanks, Mom.

11
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,313
Of course,
I thought you mlght sleep through It.

12
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:05,874
So since it's almost, oh, noon...

13
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:11,153
...I think your first big birthday
decision is breakfast or lunch?

14
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,553
Oh, could you do me a favour?

15
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,320
I forgot to get the paper.
Can you grab It for me?

16
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,272
-Sure.
-Thanks.

17
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,388
Surprlse.

18
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,874
It's from me and your dad.
It's pretty sllck, huh?

19
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,992
Yeah. Thanks, Mom. lt's.... It's great.

20
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,072
I really did a lot of research...

21
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,316
...and, I don't know,
thls car Just really stood out to me.

22
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,910
It's got a ton of great features,
power everything, solid engine.

23
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,749
It's really roomy so you can,
you know, carpool with all your friends.

24
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,031
And, of course,
It Is safe because I'm stlll your mother.

25
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,673
And it has a CD player...

26
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,553
...so you can llsten to tunes
whlle crulslng around.

27
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,153
So you know what? Breakfast can wait.
You wanna take it for a spin?

28
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,392
Maybe later. I'm kind of starving.

29
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,960
Yeah, okay. Well, let's....
Let's get those pancakes going.

30
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,314
Saul, he's here.

31
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,795
Bad idea. This is a bad idea.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,479
Saul?

33
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,191


34
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,594
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

35
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,716
-Hey.
-Yeah, hl.

36
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,716
Have a seat, please.

37
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,117


38
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,277
I don't understand why I'm here.

39
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,789
-Something to do with my creditors?
-Creditors? No.

40
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,678
l'll cut right to the chase, Mr. Beneke.
l have some bad news.

41
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,388
Nothing but lately.

42
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,988
Your Great-aunt Birgit passed away.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,069
I'm sorry, who?

44
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,759
Apparently she passed away
in Diekirch, Luxembourg.

45
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,234
And this was-- Wow, eight years ago.

46
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,716
IJust assumed you two were close,
glven that....

47
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,947
Well, maybe this is good news.

48
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,790
Birgit left behind a sizeable estate...

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,276
...of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

50
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,434
What?

51
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,154
She had no immediate relatives
so the estate's just been sitting...

52
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,954
...while the folks over in the EU
searched for a living heir.

53
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,592
Well, I don't know of any relatlves
In Luxembourg.

54
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,712
Definitely no one
who would name me in their will.

55
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,868
Well....

56
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,669
Well, here we go. She left no will.
So that's probably why it took so long.

57
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,188
They traced the Inherltance
to your father.

58
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,028
But having passed-- My condolences.
--you are the next in line...

59
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,759
...to the tune of $621,552.33.

60
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,196
And when does Don Eladio arrive?

61
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,280
Let's see how the cook goes first.

62
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,351
Who's the chemist?

63
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,159
ls thls a Joke?

64
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,714
He's asking if you're the chemist.

65
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,034
I'm one of them.

66
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:47,072
Okay, we've all met.

67
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,432
Let's get to work.

68
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,200
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

69
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,109
Please show him the phenylacetic acid.

70
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,391
We synthesize it ourselves.

71
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,597
All the ingredients are here.

72
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,555
They synthesize their own.

73
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,752
What?

74
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,874
I don't do that.

75
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,634
What's the problem?

76
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,832
Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
from the barrel with the bee on it.

77
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,031
That's howl know how to do it.

78
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,070
Mr. Pinkman was under the impression
that the phenylacetic acid...

79
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,635
...would already be syntheslzed
upon hls arrlval.

80
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,918
Any sophomore chemistry
student can make it.

81
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,113
What klnd of amateur
have you brought us?

82
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,429
-What's he saylng?
-We're worklng It out.

83
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,595
Thls ls rldlculous.

84
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,473
I'm not letting some infant...

85
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,395
...who can't even syntheslze
phenylacetlc acld...

86
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,074
...teach me my business.

87
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,108
Tell this asshole if he wants to learn
how to make my product...

88
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,438
...he's gotta do It my way.
The rlght way.

89
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,789


90
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,828
So you understand
what 'asshole' means.

91
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,635
Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid,
asshole.

92
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,914
How long is it gonna take
to get him what he needs?

93
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:39,634
I don't know. I have no Idea.
Several hours, at least.

94
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,673
I can wait. Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

95
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,030
Don't you have standards?

96
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,274
I mean, this place is disgusting.

97
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,871
All right, we're gonna scour every vat,
every tank, every cook surface.

98
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,428
We clean up every possible source
of contamination. And then we cook.

99
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,997
Who do you think you are?

100
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,828
I'm the guy your boss brought here
to show you how it's done.

101
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,031
And If thls Is how you run your lab,
no wonder.

102
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,155
You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
Now, if you don't want that to happen...

103
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,469
...I suggest you stop whining
like a little bitch, and do what I say.

104
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:43,718
Clean up!

105
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,557
...number, and the reason for your call.
Thank you.

106
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,511
Dad, you there?
I'm outside. Are you okay?

107
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,919
I know you're home, your car is here.

108
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,908
You missed my party which feels like
something's gotta be really wrong.

109
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:07,876
l.... I'm gonna have to call 911.
ldon't know what else to do.

110
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,276
Dad?

111
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,668
Come in, if you're coming in.

112
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,188
What happened to you?

113
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,110
What happened?

114
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:46,235
I got Into a flght.

115
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,399
What do you mean, a flght?
lee--? What flght?

116
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:54,187
Are you gonna talk to me here?

117
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,279
What are you doing?

118
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,709
-l'm calllng Mom.
-Don't do that.

119
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,076
Look, I....

120
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,709
I appreciate that you're concerned,
but I'm fine.

121
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,995
Just do not call your mother.

122
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,758
Why not?

123
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,477


124
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,790


125
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,191
If you tell your mother, I just--

126
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,232
I will never, never hear the end of it.

127
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,954


128
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,070
Can we just keep this between us?
Would you do that for me?

129
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,511
Just.... Just keep it to yourself.

130
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,556
I don't understand.
How'd you get Into a flght?

131
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,274
And with who?

132
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,354
I made a mistake.

133
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,633
It's my own fault.

134
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,317
-I had It comlng.
-Dad...

135
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,430
...It's okay.

136
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,916
It's all my fault.

137
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,557
l]ust....

138
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,191
I'm sorry.

139
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,993
I'm sorry.

140
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,599


141
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,195
Come here.

142
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,675
Come on. Dad, it's okay.

143
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,553
No. Hey, hey, no.

144
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,548
-lt's okay. Come on, please. It's okay.
-No.

145
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,079
Look at me. Look at me.

146
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,237
It's okay. It Is. Come on.

147
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,272
Come on.

148
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,473
Come on.

149
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,829
lt's-- It's okay.

150
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,993
Hey.

151
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,390
How was your birthday?

152
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,839
Good. Get some rest.

153
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,872
Okay.

154
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,670
The new car...

155
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,750
...did you drive it here?

156
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,832
Yeah.

157
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,519
That's good.

158
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:59,596
You llke It?

159
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,675
Sure. I do.

160
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,878
It drlves great.

161
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,635
That's good, Jesse.

162
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,119
Yes.

163
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,877
-Yes.
-Well done.

164
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,195
The flrst of many.

165
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,833
Yeah? What's that mean?

166
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,350
You're staylng.
You belong to the cartel now.

167
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,909
You can't come to my work like this.
You're too recognisable.

168
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,829
Your face is plastered on every
bus bench within a five-mile radius.

169
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,669
Celebrities have to get their cars
washed just like everybody else.

170
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:03,109
I wouldn't have come
If It wasn't Important.

171
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,151
-0kay?
-What Is It?

172
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,148
Well, I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke. Right?

173
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,716
Which, I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

174
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,514
Yes, but It Is better than prlson,
correct?

175
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:20,109
Marginally. Which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

176
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,354
All rlght, good.

177
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,834
Yeah. I can't belleve
he actually bought It.

178
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,507
Great-aunt Birgit. What?

179
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,951
But you called it. People see zeroes
dance before their eyes...

180
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,038
-...it's like highway hypnosis.
-So, what's the problem?

181
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:36,948
Let's just say, you and I don't
wear the same rose-coloured glasses...

182
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:39,070
...where Johnny Fabulous
Is concerned.

183
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,794
So I kept an eye on his bank accounts,
and pulled his credit report.

184
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,957
If you would, note the time on that.

185
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,552
Three fifty-four p.m. yesterday.

186
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,389
-Three hours after leaving my office.
-He bought a Mercedes SL550.

187
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,989
He's actually leaslng It,
but he put 4500 down.

188
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,918
He's gonna pay 1830 a month.

189
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,997
Fully loaded.
He even got the heated steering wheel.

190
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,988
But that's upwards of 6300
that won't be going to the IRS.

191
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:13,989
I just thought you might like to know,
loath as I am to say, I told you so.

192
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,358
Where is he now?

193
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,678
Hey.

194
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,717
How you dolng?

195
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,672


196
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,597
How are you?

197
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,718
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

198
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,107
I called her last night.

199
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,118
Oh, God.

200
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,029
I told her
I was spendlng the nlght at Louls'.

201
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:55,754
It's cool. So....

202
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,871
How are you?

203
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:04,151
I'm flne, son. I....

204
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,839


205
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,037
Well, I....

206
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:16,198
I took these painkillers
that I had leftover from my surgery...

207
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,914
...and I made the brilliant decision...

208
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,316
...to wash them down
wlth a couple of beers.

209
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,832
Not my most sterllng moment,
I admlt.

210
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,028
But I'm flne.

211
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:34,190
I wish I could take back last night.
It was your birthday.

212
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,038
-Thls shouldn't be on your mlnd.
-lt's okay.

213
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,194
No, It's not okay.

214
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:43,757
I'm your father,
and I don't want last nlght to be....

215
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,839
I mean, you really...

216
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,839
...can't think of me like....

217
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,234
lee what?

218
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,676
I don't understand.

219
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:14,835
My father died when I was 6.

220
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,633
-You knew that, rlght?
-Yeah.

221
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:23,032
He had Huntington's disease. It's....

222
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:28,110
It destroys portions of the brain...

223
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,112
...affects muscle control...

224
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,596
...leads to dementla,
It's just a nasty dlsease.

225
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,273
It's genetlc.

226
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,916
Terrlfled my mother
that l mlght have It...

227
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:43,512
...so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid, but I came up clean.

228
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,949
My father fell very ill when I was...

229
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,199
...four or 5.

230
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,960
He spent a lot of time in the hospital.

231
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,437
My....

232
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,518
My mother would tell me
so many stories about my father.

233
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,633
She would talk about hlm
all the tlme.

234
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,949
I knew about his personality...

235
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,798
...how he treated people...

236
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,115
...I even knew how
he llked hls steaks cooked.

237
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,833
Medlum rare.

238
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,598
Just llke you.

239
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,675
I knew things about my father.

240
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,278
I had a lot of information.

241
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,836
It's because people
would tell me these thlngs.

242
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,157
They would paint this picture...

243
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,510
...of my father for me.

244
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,151
And I always pretended
that was who I saw too.

245
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,670
Who I remembered. But it was a lie.

246
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:46,270
In truth, I only have one real...

247
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,472
...actual memory of my father.

248
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:54,518
It must have been
rlght before he dled.

249
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,394
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him.

250
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,149
And I remember the smell
in there, the chemicals.

251
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,954
It was as if they used up...

252
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,870
...every single cleaning product
they could find in a 50-mile radius.

253
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,194
Like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

254
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,878
There was thls stench
of Lysol and bleach.

255
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,640
I mean, you could just feel It
coatlng your lungs.

256
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:24,318
Anyway, there lying on the bed...

257
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,396
...Is my father.

258
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,111


259
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,749
He's all twisted up.

260
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,790
And my mom...

261
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:40,116
...she puts me on her lap.

262
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,710
She's sitting on the bed next to him
so I can get a good look at him.

263
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,911
But really, he just scares me.

264
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,831
And he's looking right at me...

265
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,318
...but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

266
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,434
And your grandmother is talking...

267
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:11,631
...trylng to be cheerful,
you know, as she does...

268
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,278
...but the only thlng
I could remember...

269
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:19,236
...ls hlm breathlng.

270
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,398
Thls....

271
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,229
Thls rattllng sound.

272
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,870
Like if you were shaking
an empty spray paint can.

273
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,757
Like there was nothing in him.

274
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,718
Anyway...

275
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,271
...that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

276
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:02,635
I don't want you to think of me
the way I was last night.

277
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:09,838
I don't want that to be the memory
you have of me when I'm gone.

278
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,435
Remembering you that way...

279
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,754
...wouldn't be so bad.

280
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:24,388
The bad way to remember you
would be the way....

281
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:27,832
The way you've been
thls whole last year.

282
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,113
At least last night you were....

283
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,991
You were real, you know?

284
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,434
-Bye.
-Bye.

285
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,196
Somewhere you should be?

286
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,071
Well, baslcally
It was a temporary hlatus.

287
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,636
But you give us two weeks, we will
be up and running 100 percent.

288
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,957
All right, you talk to your people
and get back to me, okay?

289
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,391
-Hl.
-Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

290
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,193
Okay. You bet.
Say hl to the klds for me.

291
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,278
-Hey.
-Hl.

292
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,548
Nice surprise. What's up?

293
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,115
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

294
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,518
Well, thlngs are....
Thlngs took a turn. It's klnd of crazy.

295
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,714
Oh, yeah?

296
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,593
The universe is telling me something.
I got some good news.

297
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,756
Some very good news...

298
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,909
...and I'm gettlng the buslness
golng agaln.

299
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,271
I figure we haven't been down long...

300
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,517
...so we should be able to get most
of our old contracts back. Sit.

301
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,790
Oh, thank you. That's--

302
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,871
Gosh, that's....

303
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,759
That's wow.

304
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,189
How is that even possible?

305
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,475
Well, I got a very unexpected
cash lnfuslon.

306
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,351
I guess someone's
looklng out for me.

307
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,039


308
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,954
Is that yours, outside?

309
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,354
Yeah, well, you know...

310
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,436
...I can't be driving a piece of crap.

311
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,551
You got to present
that successful Image.

312
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,355
nght. So the IRS stuff.
That's resolved?

313
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,039
Yeah, It's In progress.

314
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,354
So you pald them?

315
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,595
Well, not yet. But I will.

316
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,554
When?

317
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,428
Well, it's not that simple.

318
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:55,518
Here's the thing:
I never had proper legal counsel.

319
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,828
So I was thlnklng...

320
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,714
...I should hire someone good who can
maybe hammer out a better deal.

321
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,832
There wlll never
be a better deal, Ted.

322
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,235
The deal Is you pay
your back taxes...

323
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,238
...you pay your penalty
and you don't go to prlson.

324
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,273
That's a good deal. So....

325
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,118
Let's keep our priorities straight.

326
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,991
Well, my prlorlty
Is gettlng my buslness back.

327
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:23,431
And putting my employees back on the
payroll so they can pay the mortgages.

328
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:26,756
Right. But I think
your employees would agree...

329
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,951
...that you need to get
your financial situation in control...

330
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,150
...before you can help them.

331
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,635
Boy, the IRS
got you on commlsslon?

332
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,229
I'm just saylng that,
though I really understand...

333
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:40,272
...the temptatlon
to restart the buslness...

334
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,232
...maybe the universe is telling you...

335
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,829
...that you need to pay what you owe.

336
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,999
Skyler...

337
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,951
...thls Is my money.

338
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,076
Why are we having this conversation?
You're no longer a part of my life.

339
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,510
A decision you made, by the way.

340
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:03,836
So I don't understand
why you're hectoring me about this.

341
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,555
-Ted, thls affects both of us.
-No It doesn't.

342
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,272
I'm telling you to drop this.

343
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,994
You need to use that money
to pay your blll.

344
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,558
By the end of this month.

345
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,512

361
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,595

You address him as Don Eladio.

372
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,996
It's a term of respect.

373
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,151
Hello, young man.

374
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,674
He doesn't speak
a word of Spanlsh, does he?

375
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,632
And he's no chemist...

376
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,232
...I'll tell you that.

377
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,467
I don't care if he's a pig farmer.

378
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:07,314
He cooks better meth than you do...

379
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,353
...wlth all your fancy
college degrees.

380
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,878
And this one will have
plenty of time to learn Spanish.

00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:25,591

Now you say:

406
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,674
This one's an addict.

407
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,155
To work, he must be sober.

408
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,590
None for you!

409
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,271

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,636
...I'm not angry.

416
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:03,598
I had to spank you.

417
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,633
But what choice did I have?

418
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,668
Look, once every 20 years...

419
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,075
...you forget your place.

420
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:22,509
There's no place for emotion in this.

421
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,469
You of all people should understand.

422
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,234
Business is business.
