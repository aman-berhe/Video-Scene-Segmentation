1
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,758
It came out of nowhere.

2
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,314
You gotta help us.

3
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,272
Look at a" this damn water.
Don't drlnk that.

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,597
Aln'l no telling
If It's gonna be polson.

5
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,274
Nolhlng ordlnary.

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,157
How's Junlor?

7
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,114
Exactly what I expected.

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,392
He hasn't said a word
since we told him it was going back.

9
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,990
I spoke to the dealership,
they didn't wanna take it.

10
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,678
What?

11
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,912
It's in perfect condition.

12
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,918
-lt'a got 17 mile: on the odometer.
-I know.

13
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,079
I spent an hour sweet-talking
the manager down to a restocking fee.

14
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,191
Eight hundred dollars.

15
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,754
Eight hundred dollars?
For two days?

16
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,191
Well, the law says they don't have
to take it back at all.

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,393
All right, here's the registration,
the window sticker, the receipt.

18
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,829
Make sure you talk
to the general manager.

19
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,678
His name is Glenn.

20
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,199


21
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,915
Call me if there's a problem.
And please just don't--

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,997
Don't tangle with anyone.

23
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,838
Flne.

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,793
Walt.

25
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,670
Shlt.

26
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:07,870
Yea, hello.

27
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,798


28
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,599
Yes, thank you. The name is White.

29
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,196
I'm at the Pavilion parking lot
on University.

30
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,671
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just south of the airport.

31
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
Oh, that would be great, thank you.

32
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,507
How long do you think
that would take?

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,672
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

34
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,278
Thank you.

35
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,348
Contrltlon?

36
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,710
Hey, there is total contrition here.

37
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,588
There's mountains of contrition.

38
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,997
"Fan-tan-tastic."
|wi|| messenger them over right away.

39
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,909
Oh, and about that other thing
unrelated, yes, I can get you in...

40
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,237
...but I gotta warn you,
the eighth hole |s murder.

41
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,154
Oh, yeah.
You wanna make It Interesting?

42
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,112
Great. Tee time is 7 a.m. sharp.

43
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,275
Prepare to have your ass handed
to you.

44
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:09,595
Okay. Bye.

45
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,029
He was headed for destruction
of property. Since it's your property...

46
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,153
...| sweated him down
to misdemeanour trash burning.

47
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,513
Now, the only thing ls,
It's not gonna be free.

48
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,951
There's a 5 grand fine,
600 for towing and disposal...

49
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,150
...3 grand to steam-clean
the blacktop.

50
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,311
...about 52,000 bucks.

51
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,749
So was it worth it?

52
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,748
I don't need to hear the blow-by-blow.
Just tell me it's done.

53
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,916
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

54
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,713
I caught this thing
before It got Into the system.

55
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
Your record stays clean,
the wife never finds out.

56
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,514
I've been working magic here.
I could at least get an attaboy.

57
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,076
Fine. Rebel without a cause, give.

58
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,350
What Is It? Frlng?

59
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,308
He will see me dead.

60
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,794
And there's nothing I can do
about It.

61
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,198
All that's left is to wait.

62
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,073
And we're sure about this.

63
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,113
Because Plnkman says
he needs you too much.

64
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,469
Plnkman says.

65
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,548
Plnkman says.

66
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,916
Unless...

67
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,835
...you could help me find
a third party.

68
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,110
What third party?

69
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:52,750
Someone who can ameliorate
the situation.

70
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,837
Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right?

71
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,995
You talking about a hit man?

72
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,794
Assuming that's still
what they're called.

73
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,473
Wrong answer.

74
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,513
That's what the kids call "epic fail."

75
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,911
All I would need is a phone number.
I'd do the rest.

76
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,634
Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.

77
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,988
A big one.

78
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,597
If you held my feet to the fire,
I could come up with names.

79
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,552
One or two guys west of the Rockies
who do this work.

80
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,557
But guess what. These guys?

81
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
They know Mike
and Mike knows them.

82
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,874
Mike knows everyone who does this?

83
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,957
Who do you think gave me
their names?

84
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,708
All right. Okay, plan B.
Look, we go outside my network.

85
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,275
Craigslist. Soldier of Fortune.

86
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,392
Let's say we get lucky.
I mean, lncredlbly lucky...

87
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,477
...and find a guy who's not a cop...

88
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,592
...or some kind
of survlvallst nut-Job wannabe.

89
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,872
You gotta ask yourself:
How good is good enough?

90
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,834
Whatever goombah we buy
is gonna come head-to-head with Mike.

91
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,313
And Gus Frlng?

92
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,717
Hey, just winging that guy is
not gonna "ameliorate" your situation.

93
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,591
Not by a damn sight.

94
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,951
I've tried to solve this,
but I can't get anywhere near him.

95
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,309
You can't get near him?

96
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,669
Why don't you ask your partner?

97
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,994
Yeah, I saw him.

98
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,434
And you tell Saul before you tell me?

99
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,154
Look, he's my lawyer,
same as yours.

100
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,238
Every time I go over there,
Saul hassles me about Mike.

101
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,273
He's still scared
the dude's gonna come break his legs.

102
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:27,039
So I give him the latest.

103
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,070
What happened exactly?

104
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:35,947
l was at a diner with Mike
and he Just shows up.

105
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,515
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

106
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,198
That's It.

107
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,312
So this is, like, a regular thing?

108
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,997
How close were you to him?

109
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,315
Close.

110
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,670
I mean, closer than you and me
right now.

111
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,399
Did he speak to you?

112
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:03,111
It was over in 10 seconds.

113
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,117
Would you just answer?

114
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,517
He said, he sees things in people.

115
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,791
What things?

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,319
What people?

117
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,508


118
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:17,916
He said, he sees something in me.

119
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,910
A month ago,
Gus was trying to kill both of us.

120
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:32,147
And now he pulls you out of the lab
and employs you as what?

121
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,952
An assistant gunman?

122
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,878
A tough guy?

123
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,878
Does that make any sense to you?

124
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,475
He says, he sees something in you.

125
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,275
What kind of game is he playing?

126
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,913
Does he think you're that naive?

127
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,188
He can't truly think
that you'd forget--

128
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,197
Well, let alone Gale,
let alone Vlctor...

129
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,391
...and all the horror
that goes along with all of that.

130
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,954
What about this girlfriend of yours...

131
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,196
...and her little brother?

132
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,311
I mean, the man looked you straight
In the eye...

133
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,355
...and told you, "No more children."
But that very night, that little boy...

134
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,794
...he just--

135
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,797


136
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,194
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

137
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,395
-0kay.
-All I'm just saying Is that...

138
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:33,911
...is it possible that he would think
that you're that weak-willed?

139
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,873
Drop the sales pitch.

140
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,798
I'll do It.

141
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,711
You'll do what?

142
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,391


143
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:48,233
Flrst chance I get.

144
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,315
Pltla colada?
More like stale bubblegum.

145
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,398
Does anyone want their car to smell
like the bottom of a 6th-grader's desk?

146
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,032
Okay. Hemp? Really?

147
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,630
I know. But you know what they say.
"The customer's always right."

148
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,469
Speaking of customer, it's not too late
to have a grand opening.

149
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,638
l was thinking huge party, balloons,
bouncy house for the kids...

150
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,751
...you know, make a splash,
get on TV.

151
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,668
Let people know they won't face the
eyebrows of doom when they come in.

152
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,039
Marie, how's Hank doing?

153
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,437
You know what? He's doing better.

154
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,359
-Really?
-Yeah. He--

155
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,439
Lately, his moods improved
and he's like a maniac with his PT.

156
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,595
That's fantastic.

157
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,587
Yeah, don't get me wrong,
he's got a long way to go, but he--

158
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,472
-Yeah.
-0h, hey.

159
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,992
-Hey. HI, Walt. It's good to see you.
-Hey. You too.

160
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,397
Hey, your cashler here
Is quite the salesperson.

161
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:09,114
She just talked me into something
called the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

162
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,312
Oh, yeah, it's very important
to maintain your clear coat.

163
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,918
Boy, once that's goes--

164
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,439
Oh, yeah.

165
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,392


166
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,558


167
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,149
Bogdan was averaging 19 cars
during rush hour...

168
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:30,908
...and we are already up to 22.
Twenty-two actual cars.

169
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:35,954
Last night, I deposited $3800.

170
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,949
Jesus.

171
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,548
How much is that?

172
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,753
Two hundred seventy-four
thousand dollars, give or take.

173
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,871
-G|ve or take?
-Yeah.

174
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,271
I haven't counted it.

175
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,037
Walt.

176
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,713
Two hundred and seventy-four--

177
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,671
And this is how often?

178
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,518
Every two weeks.

179
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:02,394
Thursday's good for a drop-off?

180
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,158
But, Walt...

181
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:10,509
...are you telling me
you make $7,125,000 a year?

182
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,873
Seven and a half even,
before expenses.

183
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,833
But I can't--

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,872
-Thls Is too much.
-So It's more...

185
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,150
...than you thought...

186
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,953
...and this is somehow bad news?

187
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,354
No, that's not the point.

188
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,915
I mean, there's no car wash
In the world...

189
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,076
...that could do
this kind of business.

190
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,273
I mean, this Is nine months work here,
mlnlmum.

191
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,948
Seven million?
That could take years.

192
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,992
So set some aslde.
Save It for a rainy day.

193
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,794
Save it? Where? Save it where?

194
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,198
I can't go to the bank with it.
I sure can't leave it here.

195
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,831
Walt a minute.

196
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,439
Is this all 50s?

197
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,633
-Who pays for a car wash with a 50?
-Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.

198
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,876
l was under the impression
that you had this under control.

199
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,913
I just didn't expect
this amount of money.

200
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,111
-The 50s are gonna be a problem.
-That's what this is, problem solving.

201
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,431
This is a simple division of labour.

202
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,632
I bring money. You launder money.
This is what you wanted.

203
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,069
I never wanted any of this.

204
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,038
I've gotta go.

205
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,833
If you want out,
just say that you want out.

206
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,438
Okay, then.

207
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,031
You're telling me
you made this In the lab?

208
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,993
Why not?

209
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,273
Making It In his own lab
seemed appropriate.

210
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,993
There's not much of it.

211
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,071
We had more for Tuco.

212
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,838
It's enough.

213
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,757
This is still the best way.

214
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,157
You go after him with a gun,
you'll never get out of it alive.

215
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,839
But with this?

216
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,155
You slip it into his food or drink.

217
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,510
There shouldn't be
any taste or smell.

218
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,234
Thlrty-slx hours later....

219
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,476
A man his age,
working as hard as he does...

220
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,035
...no one will be surprised.

221
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,751
What about Mike?

222
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,237
Mike can have his suspicions,
but that's all they'll be.

223
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,835
Please, one homlcldal manlac
at a time.

224
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,073
I don't know
when I'm gonna see Gus agaln.

225
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,195
I mean, If ever.

226
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,996
Keep It with you.

227
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,949
When you have the opportunity...

228
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,833
...be ready.

229
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,275
What if they search me?

230
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,509
Will they do that?

231
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,552
It's the wrong way around.

232
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,389
It's my lucky cigarette.

233
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,632
Well...

234
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,719
...whatever you do, don't smoke it.

235
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:17,475
You know they have a drlve-thru,
rlght?

236
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,317
No, this Is good.

237
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,909
Could use the exercise,
get the blood pumping.

238
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,713
Don't worry,
you're not gonna have to pick me up.

239
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,673
Mlght take me a while,
but I'll get there.

240
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,799
Jesus, aln't we a pair.

241
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,832
Hey, you must really like chicken.

242
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:44,187
V-8, 470 horses, 20-inch rims,
satellite radio, Bluetooth.

243
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,597
Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

244
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,995
Whoa, whoa, what do you mean,
on a lark?

245
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,433
Spur of the moment, your dad ups
and buys you a brand-new Challenger?

246
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:57,517
Yeah, I barely got It
around the block...

247
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,998
...and Mom said we couldn't afford it
so they took it back.

248
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:05,555
Do you know how long I had it?
Fifteen hours.

249
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,512
Well, hey, buddy,
let me tell you something.

250
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:10,992
When I was your age...

251
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,432
...l'd have given my left nut
to drive a car like that for 15 minutes.

252
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,870
Seriously, how does that happen?

253
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,039
Well, we were looking at used cars
and I kind of--

254
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,469
You gullted hlm Into It. I know.
I hear you.

255
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,195
You pulled the old, "Poor little me
and my troubles," am I right?

256
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,358
-Maybe.
-You flew too close to the sun.

257
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,437
You'd let him buy you a clunker,
you'd be driving now...

258
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,948
...lnstead
of borrowing mom's hooptle.

259
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,115
Agent Schrader.

260
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,072
-How are you doing?
We”, thank you. Good to see you.

261
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,032
Do you remember Mr. Fring?

262
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:45,707
-How are you?
-Well. Nice to see you again.

263
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,592
It's a pleasure to see you.
You're looking well.

264
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,748
Yeah, well, you know, chalk it up
to clean living and vitamin pills.

265
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,520
I must apologlse.
If I had seen you come In...

266
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,869
...there'd have been no question
of accepting your money.

267
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,116
In the future, feel free to ask for me.

268
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,154
A DEA hero should never have to pay
for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.

269
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,909
No kidding?
Well, I'll take you up on that, for sure.

270
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,871
And how are your mother
and father?

271
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,511
-The chicken Is great.
-Thank you.

272
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,598
If ever you're interested
in rewarding part-time work...

273
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:20,518
...perhaps something after school?
My door is open.

274
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,153


275
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,435
I don't know about this one.
He might eat up all your profits.

276
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,196
I'll let you finish your meal.
Can I get you anything else?

277
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,233
-A reflll, perhaps?
-No, thank you. I'm good.

278
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:37,148
-Sure. Take a Diet Coke, thank you.
-0f course.

279
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,191
So where are we going?

280
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:15,677
Oh, big doings today.

281
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:21,317
The order of the day Is eyes open,
mouth shut.

282
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,072
What's up?

283
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,078
Test.

284
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,591
Test.

285
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,068
You got me?

286
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,872
Count off.

287
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,713
Let's go.

288
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,990
Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

289
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,316
You know how to make coffee?

290
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,754
Sure.

291
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,678
There you go.

292
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,194
-You want a rundown?
-Please.

293
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,869
Three guys up at the gate,
two visible, one in the blind.

294
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,788
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

295
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:58,118
I got Tyrus down in the tree line
with a Barrett .50.

296
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,312
Planted him there last night,
in case we had any early arrivals.

297
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,032
I don't have an extra holster.

298
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,673
Stlck this In your pocket.
Keep It out of sight.

299
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,351
If you're gonna be here today,
you're gonna have a gun.

300
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,669
It's loaded?

301
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:47,311
I don't wanna see that in your hand
unless you see me with mine.

302
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,749
Emergency only.

303
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,716
Flrst car Is comlng.

304
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,839
All right,
what's the order of the day?

305
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,275
Eyes open, mouth shut.

306
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,830
A lot of guns.

307
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,837
Nobody's asking you
to gIve up yours.

308
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,911
You wanna sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

309
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,430
I am the guy.

310
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,595
All right, then.

311
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,997
Welcome.

312
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,157
Where is the rest of your party?

313
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,319
lam the only one coming.

314
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,272
And why Is that?

315
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,151
My employers feel I can adequately
represent their interests.

316
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,478
Please, sIt.

317
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,433
This Is my offer.

318
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,311
In consideration
of our previous relationship...

319
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,512
...I will make a one-time payment...

320
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,872
...of 50 million US. dollars.

321
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,115
In return our business is concluded.

322
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,515
No further payments.
No further contact.

323
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,432
An absolute severance.

324
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,109
You have no response?

325
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,788
This Is my response:

326
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,793
Yes or no?

327
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,268
You know what the Cartel wants.

328
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,149
Anything else would be a waste of time.

329
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,437
Is It to be yes...or no?

330
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,999
A hard way to begin a negotiation.

331
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:11,714
This is not a negotiation.

332
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,992
You got something of mine?

333
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,235
Glove box.

334
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,394
Figure I better teach you
how to shoot.

335
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,510
Could be things are gonna get hairy.

336
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,197
What Is this?

337
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,757
I mean, you're giving me a gun...

338
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,555
...and now I'm, like, part of the team
or whatever?

339
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,633
He said he sees something in me.

340
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,914
Like what?

341
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:53,439
If I had to put it in a word...

342
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,874
...l'd guess loyalty.

343
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,832
Loyalty.

344
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,876
Only maybe you got It
for the wrong guy.

345
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,758
Jesse?

346
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,357
-Hey.
-Hey.

347
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,391
Long time, no see.

348
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:34,551
How you doing?

349
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,431
Yeah, you know...

350
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:39,593


351
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,518


352
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,395
Okay, we're gonna get started.
You comlng In?

353
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:53,309
So the truth is, we can't change
the past, what's done is done.

354
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,796
We've gotta own our actions,
but putting ourselves on trial...

355
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,753
...acting as our own judge, jury
and executioner, it's not the answer.

356
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,154
A lot of the time,
all that judglng does...

357
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,558
...ls just ensure
that we're gonna repeat the cycle.

358
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,432
nght?

359
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,717
"I'm such an asshole.

360
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,549
It's totally hopeless,
what's the point?

361
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,511
I think I'll have a hit."

362
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:19,874
Jesse...

363
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:23,187
...what's going on with you
these days?

364
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,272
I went back to the crystal.

365
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,471
You sober now?

366
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,069
Yeah.

367
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,837
Four days.

368
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:37,911
Hey, four days is four days.

369
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,438
You're here.

370
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,917
You stIll...

371
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,833
...working at the laundry?

372
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,108
How are things there?

373
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,555


374
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,118
Anything you wanna talk about?

375
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,070
A couple of weeks back...

376
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,676


377
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:14,711
You hit it with your car?

378
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,072


379
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,196
I put him down.

380
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,990
I watched him go.

381
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:28,232
l was looking him straight in the eye.

382
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,876
He didn't know what was happening.
He didn't know why. He--

383
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,071
He was just scared.

384
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,952
And then he was gone.

385
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,550
He was suffering.

386
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,397
It was a kindness.

387
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,107
No, he wasn't slck.

388
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,670
No. He was just, like--

389
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,916
I don't know, like, a...

390
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:00,835
...problem dog.

391
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,758
What did he do?

392
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:03,914
Bite someone?

393
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:08,910
No, this dog never--

394
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,509
Never bit anybody.

395
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,194
You pick up the rock,
you go right to the dark side.

396
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,428
Anything can happen.

397
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,834
It ain't no rock that made me do it.

398
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,348
What was the problem?
Why did you kill him?

399
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,676
Watch the crosstalk, please.

400
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:29,669
Maybe It's not the details that matter,
rlght?

401
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,474
How do you feel about what you did,
Jesse?

402
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,315
I don't know.

403
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,477
Who cares how you feel?

404
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,310
What kind of person kills a dog
for no reason?

405
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,509
Colleen.

406
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,279
Put an ad In the paper,
drop him off at a shelter.

407
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:52,438
You don't just sit there and talk about
killing a helpless, innocent animal.

408
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,396
We're not here to sit in judgement.

409
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,952
Why not?

410
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,720
Why not? Maybe she's right.

411
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,232
Maybe I should have put it in the paper.
lshould've done something different.

412
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,392
The thing is, if you just do stuff
and nothing happens...

413
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:16,989
...what's it all mean?

414
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,788
What's the point?

415
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:24,877
Oh, right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

416
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,197
Kicking yourself
doesn't give meaning to anything.

417
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,359
So I should stop judging...

418
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,315
-...and accept?
-lt's a start.

419
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,033
So no matter what I do...

420
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,469
...hooray for me
because I'm a great guy?

421
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,635
It's all good?

422
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,109
No matter how many dogs I kill, I just,
what, do an inventory and accept?

423
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,628
I mean, you back your truck over
your own kid and you, like, accept?

424
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,830
-What a load of crap?
-Hey, Jesse.

425
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,154
I know you're in pain.

426
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,315
No, you know what?

427
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,592
Why I'm here in the first place?

428
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:11,958
Is to sell you meth.

429
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:17,430
You're nothing to me but customers!

430
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,157
I made you my bitch.

431
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,635
You okay with that?

432
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,150
You accept?

433
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,148


434
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,631
About time.

435
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,394
Jesse.

436
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,873
Jesse.

437
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,469
Bring a light over here, will you?

438
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,549
Do you see any residue there?

439
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,309
-Where?
-Here. On the bottom, right there.

440
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,437
It's been a week. What's going on?

441
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,229
I haven't seen him.

442
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,628
I didn't think so. But I'll just give it
another shot anyway.

443
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,674
-Hey.
-Hey, buddy. Look at that.

444
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,316
Graduated to doorman.
Finally found your calling.

445
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,316
Oh, little whiskers, Marie.

446
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,475
What dId you do?

447
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:26,718
Show your barber a picture
of a dog's ass and said, "I'll take that"?

448
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,069
Charmlng as usual.

449
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,395
Welcome back.

450
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,715
-Looklng good, Marle.
-Thanks, Steve.

451
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,879
-Good to see you. How you doing?
-He's fine. We can take it from here.

452
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,956
-Yeah.
-lf you wanna hold his elbow.

453
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,039
No, no, no. You keep your mitts off me.
I'm good. I'm good.

454
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,154
Hey.

455
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,032


456
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,150
Let's go, we're running late.
Come on.

457
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,235
Hank, seeing you walk in here, I can't
tell you what that means to all of us.

458
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:08,431
Your progress, it's incredible.

459
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,790
Yeah, well, chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

460
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,434
-Steve tell you his news?
-What?

461
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,596
Finally got your period?

462
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,557
I made GS-14.

463
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:21,351
Wow, that's all right, man.

464
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,279
Next stop: Washington, DC.
Sitting behind a desk...

465
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,788
...papers plled so high,
you can't see over them.

466
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:28,717
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

467
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,831
Seriously, congratulations, buddy.

468
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,359
Thanks.

469
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,754
Steve saId you might have something
for us.

470
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:37,792
Yeah, maybe.
You guys are gonna have to tell me.

471
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,870
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

472
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,274
APD detective?

473
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,595
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case.

474
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,109
The vlctlm's a 34-year-old
male Caucaslan...

475
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,311
...by the name of Gale Boetticher.

476
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,636
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door...

477
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,079
...takes a bullet to the face
from a person or persons unknown.

478
00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:00,988
Now, this Gale Boetticher
is a bona fide chemistry genius.

479
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,077
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, rlght?

480
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:08,352
And, well, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

481
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,279
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

482
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,474
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number-one meth cook.

483
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:21,548
And what caught my eye
is his speciality product is blue.

484
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,718
So, what are you thinking?

485
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,194
This is your Heisenberg?

486
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:30,875
No. What I think we got here
is Heisenberg's former cook...

487
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,470
...and maybe a line
on Helsenberg hlmself.

488
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:40,909
Anyway, lo and behold,
amidst all the hippie-dippy nonsense...

489
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,879
...I find this.

490
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,910
Now, this here,
I do a little Google-fu...

491
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,511
...and I realise it's a parts number
specifically for this baby.

492
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:58,757
That there is a high-volume
HEPA industrial air filtration system.

493
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,718
That's a 300,000-dollar gadget.

494
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,993
Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant
or microchip factory...

495
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,034
...or maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

496
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,471
Okay.

497
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,034
So this little dlngus here
Is manufactured...

498
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,108
...by a big international concern:
Madrigal Electromotive.

499
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,711
I call their Houston office, I get through
to the nicest little 20-year-old temp.

500
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,799
I use the Schrader sweet-talk.
Before you know it, she's pulling files.

501
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:35,153
Six months ago, one of these systems
was shipped to a depot here in ABQ.

502
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,270
Who signed for It?

503
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:38,754
Gale Boetticher.

504
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:44,593
So I asked my new girlfriend, "Who
paid for it?" And she says, "Nobody."

505
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,507
They have no record that anybody
actually paid for this thing.

506
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:52,995
So I go back and push more
and before you know it...

507
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,155
...the temp's gone,
there's no address.

508
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,148
I'm talking to some snot-nose lawyer
who's asking me for my badge number.

509
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,112
Brlck wall.

510
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,879
So I take a peek
Into Madrlgal Electromotive.

511
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,513
Now, Madrlgal
Is based In Hanover, Germany...

512
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,313
...but they're
what they call 'hlghly dIverslerd.‘

513
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,115
Industrial equipment, global shipping,
major construction...

514
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:19,392
...and a tiny little foothold
In American fast food...

515
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,875
...specifically a local chain.

516
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,992
Pollos Hermanos.

517
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,435
Okay. So what, rlght?
Boettlcher's dead.

518
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,473
I got no line
on who's been bankrolllng hlm...

519
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,476
...or where his lab was.

520
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:36,829
The whole thlng's a snlpe hunt,
rlght?

521
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,918
But now I get this crazy idea...

522
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,316
...and I can't shake it.

523
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,632
I mean, I stay up nlghts
staring at the ceiling...

524
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,035
...trylng to make sense of It.
That napkln.

525
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,798
I told you Boettlcher's vegan.

526
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:54,196
We're talking this guy
makes his own fermented lentil bread...

527
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,470
...or whatever the hell that is.

528
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,875
What's a vegan doing
In a fried chicken jolnt?

529
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,872
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

530
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,718
lee who?

531
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,276
Well, like, maybe...

532
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,797
...thls guy.

533
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,877
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring, huh?

534
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,309
This whole
frlend-of-law-enforcement thlng?

535
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,512
Could be a case of, "keep your
friends close but your enemies closer."

536
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,675
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

537
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,429
Maybe he's got the connections too.
Maybe, just maybe...

538
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,195
...he's our guy.

539
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,835
Hank, no offence,
but I think you're really reaching.

540
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,157
If your guy had his meeting at KFC...

541
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,194
...you wouldn't immediately assume
he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.

542
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,992
You know, In

543
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:54,669
I couldn't agree more, guys.

544
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,438
Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know.

545
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:04,270
The whole thing is off-the-map nuts.

546
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,558
I ought to be wearing a tlnfoll hat,
you know?

547
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,712
Except...

548
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,549
...I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing...

549
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:20,469
...and that Is,
what are Gustavo Frlng's flngerprlnts...

550
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:23,947
...dolng
In Gale Boettlcher's apartment?
