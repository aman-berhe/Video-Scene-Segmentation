1
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,716
Okay. That's okay.

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,719
Get that.

3
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,112
Hay.

4
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,156
-0h, God. Plea“.
-0h, Juz.

5
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,712
Plea“.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,148
Plea“.

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,919
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,838
You sure this is the way to go?

9
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:01,193
Yaah.

10
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,673
Yaah.

11
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,314
You no that?

12
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:55,119
-What does he remember?
-Not a whole lot.

13
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,071
He came In dehydrated
and dlaorlented...

14
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,873
...but once we gave him fluids
he stabilised pretty quickly.

15
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,148
But I mean....

16
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,591
-He knows where he la?
-0h, yea, yea. Absolutely.

17
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,997
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

18
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,667
Go on in. He's probably awake.

19
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,033
My God.

20
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,198
Walter.

21
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,877
I'm so sorry.

22
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,429
Come here.

23
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,834
You know who I am, right?

24
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,079
Yes, son. I know who you are.

25
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,999
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

26
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,867
It's so good to see you.

27
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,791
How do you feel?

28
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,274
Better.

29
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,232
Yeah. I....

30
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,590
I feel like myself.

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,711
Really, I mean, In....

32
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,794
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that...

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,989
...I feel fine.

34
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,111
My God, Walt.

35
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,510
What a day this has been.

36
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,711
So, Uncle Hank,
he was In a shootout?

37
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,953
A shootout?

38
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,992
He killed some guy.
Some blg drug dealer.

39
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,154
Uncle Hank wasted him.

40
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,920
-0h, my God. Is he all right?
-Absolutely flne.

41
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,748
-Where did this happen? How could--?
-Walt, everything's okay.

42
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,234
We're all okay.

43
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,035
We'll be all right.

44
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,753
And no idea what caused it?

45
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,109


46
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,152
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so....

47
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:47,147
But what could it be? I mean, did they
give you a worst-case scenario?

48
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,398
I really....

49
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,952
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so....

50
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,592
Well, which supermarket?

51
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,712
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

52
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,513
-Marle.
-l.... Don't get me wrong.

53
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,510
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

54
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,438
IJust, I mean....

55
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,109
He.... Naked?

56
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,992
He was naked.

57
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,871


58
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,593
In a supermarket.

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,119
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,509
In any case, I'm gonna get over there
as soon as I can.

61
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,632
No, no. Don't worry about It
rIght now, Marle.

62
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,193
How's Hank?

63
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,833
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of...

64
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,190
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

65
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,119
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

66
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,311
...they'd let him go home on time.

67
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,590
But how is he? Really?

68
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,148
Hank?

69
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,313
He's indestructible, you know that.

70
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,671
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

71
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,439
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

72
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,790
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,436
-He was shot previous to your arrIval?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,110
Again I Instructed him
to show hIs hands.

75
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,389
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehIcle...

76
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,989
...and fired on me with whatl
ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.

77
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:22,271
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

78
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,994
When he paused to reload...

79
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,470
...l was able to take
an effective shot.

80
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,913
Agent Schrader...

81
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,396
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

82
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,193
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

83
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,867
-l was tending to another matter.
-What other matter?

84
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,758
An unrelated family matter.

85
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,873
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

86
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,437
-Your brother-In-law?
-Yes, sir. He's sInce been found.

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,279
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

88
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,310
At the tIme, he'd been missing
for hours...

89
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,875
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

90
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,910
l was talking to his acquaintances...

91
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,269
...trylng to get a fix
on hIs whereabouts.

92
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,916
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

93
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,112
...a Jesse Pinkman.

94
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,710
l was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

95
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,036
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

96
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,789
-Have you run him down yet?
-Not yet, but we're working on it.

97
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,508
Man, they're like
Jehovah's WItnesses.

98
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,072
They don't gIve up.

99
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,395
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

100
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,750
-They need probable cause.
-Probable cause?

101
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,677
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

102
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,111
I told you, this is serious shit.

103
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,276
I'm like an outlaw.

104
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,594
Okay.

105
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,117
Let's do thIs.

106
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,993
Holy Chrlstl

107
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,555
You're Willy Wonka.

108
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,399
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

109
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,553
Put me on your magical boat, man.

110
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,752
Sall me down
your chocolaty rIver of meth.

111
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,233
So where you keep the pseudo?

112
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,035
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

113
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:39,754
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

114
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,631
No pseudo?

115
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,868
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

116
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,633
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

117
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:53,388
But I can't Just let you
break this down.

118
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,114
-That'd be sacrilege.
-I told you, that's why we're here.

119
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,878
-You saw the cops. nght?
-Sure.

120
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,310
But couldn't we Just
cook one quick batch?

121
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,158
-You know, for the road?
-No, forget It, all rIght?

122
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,035
-Thls stuff has to go, like, now.
-Dude, you owe me.

123
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,716
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

124
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,433
God, Badgerl

125
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,075
Don't mess with me.

126
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,596
Got It?

127
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,999
Yeah, I got It.

128
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,512
Oh, my God.

129
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,874
Okay, that's all of It.

130
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,638
This was a bad choice.

131
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,517
You sure about this guy?

132
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,789
He's totally, totally cool.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,672
He's my cousin.

134
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,995
-Yo, what'd we say, 500?
-We didn't say, and it's 1000.

135
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,519
Thousand bucks?

136
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,279
Come on, where you towIng It,
man, Seattle?

137
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,198
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

138
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,877
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

139
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,707


140
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,913
-You know what?
-Hey-- No--

141
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,873
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

142
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,436
He's totally good for It.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

143
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,633
-That rIght? You a stand-up dude?
-Yeah, I am.

144
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,956
I will get you the other 500.

145
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,274
Five hundred more.

146
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,590
Your word's your bond, right?

147
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,559
nght.

148
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,391
I saved your skInny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,514
What are you doing now, exactly?

150
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,518
I'm giving you, like, two hours...

151
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,030
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

152
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,718
You're not using your own name.

153
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,516
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

154
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,675
Why do you gotta go and do this?

155
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,429
They need probable cause.

156
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,914
I'm giving it to them.

157
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,555
What's the last thing
you remember?

158
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,110
Well, I was driving home.

159
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,868
I thlnk.

160
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,394
And....

161
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,758
Do you remember coming home?

162
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,955
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

163
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,429
You don't remember talking to me
when l was in the bathtub?

164
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,952
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

165
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:04,279
-Nothlng else? No fleetlng Images?
-Well, no. I....

166
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,709


167
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,234
l was walking down some road
or hlghway...

168
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,475
...with a lot of headlights...

169
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,638
...and I remember feeling fear.

170
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,712
-That's It.
-All right. Thank you.

171
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,797
Well, there's defInItely
some good news here.

172
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,389
The MRI shows no metastases.

173
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,353
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

174
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,312
Yeah, we're looking really good.

175
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,191
Oh, thank God.

176
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,955
So, what was it, then?

177
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,390
-There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
-And considering your condition...

178
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,192
...the blood panel looks good.

179
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,392
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

180
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,718
As of right now, we really...

181
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,238
...can't say.

182
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,714
Forgive me.
Granted, this Is not my field...

183
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,433
...but Isn't It possible
that this had something to do...

184
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,676
...wIth all the prescrIptIons
I've been taking?

185
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,359
There's the antiemetic...

186
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,312
...the antltusslve...

187
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,875
...the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

188
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,158
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say...

189
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,157
...l'm feeling much better.

190
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,827
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications...

191
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,428
...the Information sheets
are as long as your arm.

192
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,474
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

193
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,751
RIght, exactly.
Could It be that simple?

194
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,508
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

195
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,473
Wait, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

196
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,593
Stressed out? In

197
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,711
-No, I don't think I'm--
-Walt, please.

198
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,115
Stressed out is putting it...

199
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,514
...mlldly.

200
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,998
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said...

201
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,792
...l'm feeling much better.

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,560
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

203
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,558
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

204
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,199
A ways down the road?

205
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,392
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

206
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,596
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

207
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,030
Nobody lIkes beIng In the hospital.
I get that.

208
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,396
But until we know
what caused this incident...

209
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,875
...we can't be certain it won't recur.

210
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,911
-That your last hit?
-Yeah.

211
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,315
Flnlsh It qulck.

212
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,711
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

213
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,754
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

214
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,476
I'm going, I'm going.

215
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,393
What's goIng on?

216
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,510
What did I do?

217
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,238
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

218
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,640
-What, man?
-Tell me again.

219
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,834
AgaIn?

220
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,759
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and l were partying, that's it.

221
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,793
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

222
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:35,196
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

223
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,718
Taco? I don't know any Taco...

224
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,388
...and l damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

225
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,158
Three days,
you must have got hungry.

226
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,554
Yeah, I guess.

227
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,954
-You order take-out?
-Yeah.

228
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,071
Yeah, where from?

229
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,794
You get yourself a lIttle
of that moo goo gaI pan...

230
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,035
...from that chInk place
around the corner?

231
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,788
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

232
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:57,557
You know, Funyuns.

233
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,158
I had a Hot Pocket.

234
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,749
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

235
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,518
You didn't notice your car
was gone?

236
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,154
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

237
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,351
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

238
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,516
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

239
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:13,552
-You weren't answering your phone.
-It was in my car.

240
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,432
-That rIght?
-Yeah.

241
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,314
We found your car...

242
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,555
...but your phone wasn't in it.

243
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,192
You found my car?

244
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,352
You found my car?

245
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,757
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

246
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,307
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

247
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,033
DId you leave anything else
In the car?

248
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,308
LIke what?

249
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,797
LIke what? LIke....

250
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,229
I don't know. Like this?

251
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,033
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

252
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:59,797
That's not mIne.

253
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,717
That's not yours?

254
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,594
He says it's not his, Gomie.

255
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,029
Gee, I really thought
this mIght be yours.

256
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:10,675
-I wish.
-Unclalmed drug money, huh? NIce.

257
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:12,870
You know what we got here,
Gomle, don't you?

258
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,833
That's a new lnterdlctlon van
rIght there, yeah.

259
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,428
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

260
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:20,231
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

261
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,749
I lost this kInd of money,
I'd wanna kIll myself.

262
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,155
So who's your chief, little lnjun?

263
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,793
What?

264
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,877
-What does that even mean?
-I think your story's bullshit.

265
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,435
lthlnk you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

266
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,470
Your car was there
because you were there.

267
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:39,787
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

268
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,755
So, what are you saying?

269
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,791
I shot someone?

270
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,309
-W|th, like, a gun?
-You?

271
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,313


272
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,477
Only shootlng you do
Is Into a Kleenex.

273
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,676
But I think you know
the badass who did.

274
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:02,111
Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

275
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,433
Funyuns and boom-boom.

276
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,592


277
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,552
I don't think so.

278
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,750
Tell you what. We're gonna...

279
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,794
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

280
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,591
And you know what?

281
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,389
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

282
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,676
Don't go nowhere.

283
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,754
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

284
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,871
-I got medIcal Issues.
-Medlcal Issues?

285
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,956
Like, what kind of medical issues?

286
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,752
You got penis withdrawal?

287
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,190
You got schlongus interruptus?

288
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,314
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...

289
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,271
...and you get a root beer
and a tInkle.

290
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,357
-Tell me the last three days.
-I told you...

291
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,994
...we were shacked up
sInce Saturday.

292
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,271
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

293
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,837
Not even for a second?

294
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,994
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

295
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,872
Maybe?

296
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,752
Did Jesse leave the room?

297
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:23,551
He dld, dldn't he?

298
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,992
Wendy, you can do It.
You can do It, Wendy.

299
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,319
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

300
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,996
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

301
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,994
It's you. I know you.

302
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,397
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

303
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,272
-What?
-The kid with the crutches.

304
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,675
-The football player.
-How about we stay on topic?

305
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,792
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

306
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,672
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

307
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,517
And that's all I'm saying about that.

308
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,229


309
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,510
Where's my root beer?

310
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,909
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

311
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,552
It's a long story, Gomie.

312
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,115
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

313
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,357
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

314
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,270
And how are you sleeping?

315
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:26,914
Flne. Most nIghts.

316
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:28,354


317
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,835
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images...

318
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,075
...thIngs you can't
get out of your head?

319
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,428
How about feelings of guilt
or persecutlon?

320
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:44,268
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

321
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,312
...but where is this going, exactly?

322
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,750
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

323
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,509
-Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
-Ongoing for how long?

324
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:55,947
I just met you. Hard to say.

325
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,037
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

326
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:04,109
Look, doctor, lfeel fine, really.

327
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,548


328
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,833
...if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

329
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,555
Walt...

330
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,149
...a fugue state
Is a very serious event.

331
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,396
What If you were to dlsassoclate
while driving?

332
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,635
Get into a situation...

333
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,671
...where you could be shot
by the police?

334
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:24,471
We can't allow you to leave...

335
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,637
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

336
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,479
SayIng you feel fine
doesn't solve thIs.

337
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,952
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

338
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,275
It's very straightforward.

339
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,711
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

340
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,147
What about my family?

341
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,557
Not your family, not to the polIce.
Not to anyone.

342
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,273
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

343
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,995
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

344
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,670
And you, as a medical practitioner...

345
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,949
...you abIde
by these strlctures absolutely.

346
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,433
Yes.

347
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,595
All right.

348
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,150
There was no fugue state.

349
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:17,910
I remember everything.

350
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,316
The truth ls...

351
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,989
...I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

352
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,476
I just had to get out...

353
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,274
...and so I left.

354
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,550
I didn't think about It.
ljust dId It.

355
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,868
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

356
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:45,392
I got as far as Gallup...

357
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,678
...and then It was just time
to come home.

358
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:53,392


359
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,319
...belng found naked
In a supermarket...

360
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,909
...that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

361
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,191
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

362
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,197
Why run away?

363
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,312
What dId you feel
you had to run from?

364
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,111
Doctor, my wife
Is seven months pregnant...

365
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,231
...with a baby we didn't intend.

366
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:29,709
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

367
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,072
lam an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

368
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,875
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

369
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,036
l have watched
all of my colleagues...

370
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,514
...and friends surpass me
In every way lmagInable...

371
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,429
...and within 18 months,
lwIll be dead.

372
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,869
And you ask why I ran?

373
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,072
Gomie, you wanna do the honours?

374
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,877
-What's that mean?
-That means yes.

375
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,914
-Yes Is a bell, no Is no bell.
-Come on, this Is bullshlt.

376
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,589
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

377
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,198
Sehor...

378
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,437
...are we on the planet Mars?

379
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,872
Are we on the planet Saturn?

380
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,758
Are we on the planet Earth?

381
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,312
Seﬁor, is today Friday?

382
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,078

383
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:07,712
ls today Tuesday?

384
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,907
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for It.

385
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,114
Sehor...

386
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:18,358
...was this man
at your house yesterday?

387
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,950
Sehor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

388
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,278
ThIs guy rIght here,
he was at your house, rIght?

389
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,630
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

390
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:48,273
Seﬁor, are you scared of this man?

391
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,114
No, he's not scared.

392
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,829
Come on, Granddad.

393
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,189
Don't you wanna help us out?

394
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,835
Oh, man.

395
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,478
I guess that's a no.

396
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,273
-I told you, numbnuts. ThIs guy's 06.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

397
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,516
Kept hIs mouth shut for 17 years
In San Quentin.

398
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,632
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

399
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,719
-All right. It was worth a try at least.
-We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

400
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,750
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

401
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,951
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

402
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,310
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do...

403
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,510
...with shooting Tuco, man.

404
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,793
Dad? Hey, Dad.

405
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,717
Hey, can you hear me?

406
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,432
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm...

407
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:03,834
What's--?

408
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,872
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

409
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,752
You know, I actually...

410
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,599
...lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

411
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,949
I've been busy as....

412
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:14,956
As totally productive.

413
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,311
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

414
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,671
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

415
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:24,234
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

416
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,669
Hey, could you give me a ride?

417
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:31,111
I'm actually--
I'm downtown and my car's In the....

418
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:35,710
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I wIll--

419
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,469

when you have some....

420
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,110
Okay. Yeah. No. l--

421
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,834
I get It. I get It.

422
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,314
Okay, bye.

423
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,151
Thanks.

424
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,999
So, what are you doing now?

425
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,076
Waffle House?

426
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,347
Waffle House is good.

427
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:40,594
Pay phone?

428
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,360
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

429
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,514
So how dId It go?

430
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,798
Okay. You?

431
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:52,117
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

432
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,556
-So you gettIng out of there?
-Tomorrow.

433
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,670
So who came for you?

434
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,551
The DEA? What did they ask you?

435
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:02,069
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law...

436
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,759
...took my rainy-day fund.

437
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,678
Your what? What is that?

438
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:08,996
My ralny-day fund.
Slxty-elght thousand, okay?

439
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:11,030
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed In my face.

440
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,070
Now I got like 80 bucks
to my name.

441
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,598
Wait, wait. What does he know?

442
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,312
Does he know it's your money?

443
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,908
No, man.
He doesn't know shIt, okay?

444
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,598
The plan worked.

445
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,948
They bought It.

446
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,514
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

447
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,679
-Dld he mentIon my name?
-No. Thanks for carlng.

448
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,554
-What about the basement?
-lt's clean.

449
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,636
And the RV?

450
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,514
Badger's cousln took It to hIs garage.
It's safe.

451
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,950
Can he get it running again?

452
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,627
-Why?
-So we can cook.

453
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,471
So you still wanna cook?

454
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,079
Serlously?

455
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,870
What's changed, Jesse?

456
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,394
Seven-hundred
thlrty-seven thousand.

457
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,477
Twenty-one pounds...

458
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,909
...minus cash on hand....

459
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:11,788
Cash on hand.

460
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,398
-Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
-No, l was awake.

461
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,512
-Want some cornflakes?
-Yeah, sure.

462
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,595
-You okay?
-Yeah.

463
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,110
Southwest Aniline again?

464
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,474
What's this?

465
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,909
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

466
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,430
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

467
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,870
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

468
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,310
P2P, huh?

469
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,999
So, what are you thinking?

470
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,996
The two stooges over here
cooked It?

471
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,997
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

472
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,632
At least since this.

473
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,350
-Krazy-8.
-Yeah.

474
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,398
Krazy-a, Tuco....

475
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,156
Somehow, some way,
It's all connected.

476
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,070
A simple explanation...

477
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:35,713
...only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

478
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,354
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

479
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,755
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

480
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:42,792
It's 11 In the morning.

481
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:43,954
I'm buying.

482
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,354
You're buying? Holy crap.

483
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:48,278
-What, Is It Clnco de Mayo already?
-Oh, yeah.

484
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,875
Surprlse.

485
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,631
You little sneaky bastard, you.

486
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,393

00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,316

00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,077
-Hey, thanks, man.
-Thank you.

492
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,828
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

493
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,917
You shouldn't have.

494
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,076
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

495
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,917
I love It.

496
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,711
You goIng to finish
your apple juice?

497
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,597
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

498
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,032
You're supposed to drink it.

499
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,516
The nurse saId
you have to stay hydrated.

500
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,678
But I'm not thIrsty.

501
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,997

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,470
Oh, yeah.
MarIe stopped by this morning.

508
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:15,432
They really cheer the place up.

509
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:19,473
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

510
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:22,989
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

511
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:26,152
So tell us about the shootout.

00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:32,114
Whole thing was over
In about five seconds.

514
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,151
Say, Walt, you know...

515
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:36,953
...how are you?

516
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,834
I'm okay.

517
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,507
Really, I'm feeling fine.

518
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,910
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Yeah.

519
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:46,838
The doctor is calling it a....

520
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,919
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

521
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,599


522
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:54,357
Which means non-recurring.

523
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,630
Non-recurrlng.
That sounds good, yeah.

524
00:39:56,839 --> 00:39:58,192
Sounds real good.

525
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,870
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

526
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,798
LIsten, Hank.

527
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,233
I don't know what to say. I mean...

528
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:13,116
...you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so....

529
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,835
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut It. Not nearly.

530
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,507
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

531
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,996
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

532
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,350
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake...

533
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,470
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?

534
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,716
You ought to disappear more often.

535
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,195
Just kidding. Don't do that.

536
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,956
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

537
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,673
Look what they gave me.

538
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,074
What Is It?

539
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:44,557
That, gentlemen,
Is the grill of the guy I shot.

540
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,879
-H|s grlll?
-Yeah.

541
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,548
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

542
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:51,954
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

543
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,674
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

544
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,598
Wow, cool.

545
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,755
Yeah.

546
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,358
I can't tell you how good It feels
to be home.

547
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,117
I'll get these in the wash.

548
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,593
Okay.

549
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,789
Say, honey, I....

550
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,755
l was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

551
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,069
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

552
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,669
Skyler, lIsten to me.

553
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,032
This will not happen again, okay?

554
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,309
I won't let It.

555
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,868
I'm still here. I'm me...

556
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:54,314
...and we're gonna be okay.

557
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,592
Walt...

558
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:06,236
...do you have a second cell phone?

559
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,872
A second cell phone?

560
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,119
The night you disappeared, you came
in when l was taking a bath...

561
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:17,310
...and you were very upset.

562
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,918
It was like something
terrible had happened.

563
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,839
And then your cell phone rang.

564
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:27,156
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

565
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,715
...and just disappeared.

566
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,799
Yeah.

567
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:35,194
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

568
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:38,277
...there was no call.

569
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,029
No call on the phone I know about.

570
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,278
That Is...

571
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:50,117


572
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,148
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

573
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:58,115
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

574
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:02,238
Okay.
