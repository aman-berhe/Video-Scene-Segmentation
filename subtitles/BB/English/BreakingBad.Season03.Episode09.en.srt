00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:07,353

"The Chlcken Brothers. "

8
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:30,558

and one belng no teellng at all.

170
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,153
Oh, I don't know.

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,630
-Four?
-Okay, tour. Okay.

172
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:52,111

173
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,112
Yeah. A slx.

174

Okay, good. And here.

Thank you very much, Hank.

00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,872
Oh, yeah, detlnltely.

181
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,359


182
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,909
It looks llke some nerve tunctlon
ls returnlng.

183
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:22,910
Oh, thank God.

184
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,595
All rlght, so when do we get hlm
walklng agaln?

185
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,792
Marle, It's Important
that we manage our expectatlons.

186
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,395
We're talklng about months
of very hard work.

187
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,517
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

188
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,635
But you can't know for sure.

189
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,393
-No.
-When does he start physlcal therapy?

190
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,629
We've sent the paperwork
to your Insurance.

191
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,633
It's hlgh-prlorlty. We should have
pre-authorlsatlon In the next few days.

192
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,392
Certalnly by early next week.

193
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,912
Next week?

194
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,429
No, that's not gonna do It.

195
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,033
I've looked Into thls.

196
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,794
And the sooner physlcal therapy
beglns, the better hls chances are.

197
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,156
He needs dally sesslons.
Isn't that rlght?

198
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,308
-Well--
-Actually...

199
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,517
...your plan's treatment programme
covers tour sesslons a week.

200
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:16,467
Actually, she asked the doctor.

201
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,758
Plan-wlse, four treatments a week
Is talrly typlcal.

202
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,878
And the theraplsts In your network
are mostly tlne.

203
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,713
Mostly tlne. Okay, well,
there's a rlnglng endorsement.

204
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:35,271
Look, It Hank had more physlcal
therapy wlth better theraplsts...

205
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,033
...wouldn't It be more llkely
he would walk?

206
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,912
It's very hard to say, Marle.

207
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,197
Is the health plan's way
medlcally Justltlable? Sure.

208
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,554
Is It absolutely optlmal?

209
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,553
You know, screw It.

210
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:56,072
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can relmburse me.

211
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:59,311
Mrs. Schrader, I get your trustratlon.
Really, I do.

212
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,553
But my best advlce Is stay
In the network. Don't go out of pocket.

213
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,631
Physlcal therapy Is Just
the beglnnlng.

214
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,314
We're talklng nurslng care,
modltlcatlons to your home...

215
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,869
...occupatlonal therapy,
medlcal equlpment.

216
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,236
It could run Into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

217
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,912
So what?

218
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,309
We're Just supposed to compromlse
on hls care?

219
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,631
Well, It you don't follow
the Insurance company's procedures...

220
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,312
...they may never pay you back.

221
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,519
I've seen patlents and thelr tamllles
go bankrupt waltlng to be relmbursed.

222
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,673
Who Is the best physlcal theraplst
that you know?

223
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,911
I can glve you some names.

224
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,150
But they're not llkely to be
on your plan.

225
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:37,547
To hell wlth the plan.

226
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,630
There he ls. Flnally.
I went ahead and started wlthout you.

227
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,711

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,268
-ExI'ol|ate.
-Maybe later.

230
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,509
Where's the maestro,

231
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,032
Do I look llke hls shadow?

232
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,793

Well, I was gonna have you two

00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,357
-For free?
-Free?

240
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,798
Oh, ladles, cover your ears.
No, not free.

241
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,996
Look, hey, thls Is a squeaky-clean,
hlghly proﬁtable--

242
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,434
At least potentlally.

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,990
--local lnstltutlon looked upon wlth
favour by the Chamber of Commerce...

244
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,153
...Better Buslness Bureau.
At $312,000, It's a steal.

245
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:53,594
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

246
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:02,672
On the lnslde, It's the best money
laundry a growlng boy could ask for.

247
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,989
Walt, walt, walt. Hey.

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,994
Humour me here for a second.

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,630
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, rlght?

252
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,509
Do you understand the baslcs of It,

253
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,513

254
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,272
Don't you want to stay out of Jall?

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,795
I mean, you wanna keep your money

00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,427
Because I got three llttle letters
for you: IRS.

257
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,033
If they can get Capone,

258
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,273
Hey, look. Here's you, rlght?

Okay, here's your cash.

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,113
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partylng hearty.

261
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,909
You're knocklng boots
wlth the chlcky babes. Oh, who's thls?

262
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,639
It's the tax man.
And he's looklng at you.

263
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,153
Now, what does he see?

264
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,880
He sees a young fellow
wlth a blg fancy house...

265
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,600
...unllmlted cash supply and no Job.

266
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,876
Now, what Is the concluslon
the tax man makes?

267
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,079
-l'm a drug dealer.
-Wrong.

268
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:08,515
Mllllon tlmes worse.
You're a tax cheat.

269
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,910
What do they do?
They take every penny...

270
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,151
...and you go In the can
for felony tax evaslon.

271
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:16,833
What was your mlstake?

272
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,309
You dldn't launder your money.

273
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:22,949
Now, you glve me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

274
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,873
Hand me that llttle thlng-- Bln.

275
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,071

276
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:34,950
I take your dlrty money and l sllp It
Into the salon's nlce clean cash flow.

277
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,792
That's called layerlng.

278
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,597
Flnal step, lntegratlon.

279
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,115
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

280
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,191
Your fllthy drug money
has been transformed...

281
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,919
...Into nlce, clean, taxable Income...

282
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,992
...brought to you by a savvy Investment
In a thrlvlng buslness.

283
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:57,312
So you want me to buy thls place
so I can pay taxes.

284
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:58,832
I'm a crlmlnal, yo.

285
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,314
Yeah, and If you wanna stay a crlmlnal
and not become, say, a convlct...

286
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,993
...maybe you should grow up
and llsten to your lawyer.

287
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,151
nght, so you can get your 5 percent.

288
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,276
No, that's 17 percent.

289
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,512
I heard you say 5.
You sald It rlght In front of me.

290
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,877
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's prlvlleges of senlorlty and all.

291
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,589
But for you, It's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargaln.

292
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,432
Hey, what? You-- Hey, l|sten--

293
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,398
Come on, I'm talklng to you about
your future here. Llsten to reason.

294
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,752
How Is your brother-In-law?

295
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,711
He'll llve.

296
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,995


297
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,077
Walter, you seem troubled.

298
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:26,116
How can I help you?

299
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,272
I asked to see you In order
to clear the alr.

300
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:42,676
There are some Issues that could cause
a mlsunderstandlng between us...

301
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:49,790
...and l thlnk It's In our best Interests
to Just lay the cards on the table.

302
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,154
That's the best way to do buslness.

303
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:00,314
My brother-ln-law,
moments before he was attacked...

304
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,913
...someone called to warn hlm.

305
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,353
l belleve that same person
was protectlng me.

306
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:13,278
Those two men, the assasslns...

307
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,552
...l belleve l was thelr prlme target.

308
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,079
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-ln-law.

309
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,110
Because of thls lnterventlon...

310
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,675
...I am allve.

311
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,675
And yet I thlnk that thls person...

312
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:40,071
...was playlng a much deeper game.

313
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:45,595
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout...

314
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,593
...not a sllent assasslnatlon.

315
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:53,430
In one stroke,
he bloodled both sldes...

316
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,788
...set the Amerlcan and Mexlcan
governments agalnst the cartel...

317
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:03,157
...and cut off the supply
of methamphetamlne to the Southwest.

318
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,229
If thls man had hls own source
of product on thls slde of the border...

319
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,512
...he would have the market
to hlmself.

320
00:22:18,399 --> 00:22:23,427
The rewards would be enormous.

321
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,433
We're both adults.

322
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,630
I can't pretend I don't know
that person Is you.

323
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,119
I want there to be no confuslon.

324
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,318
I know I owe you my llfe.

325
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:55,035
And more than that...

326
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,639
...I respect the strategy.

327
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,675
In your posltlon...

328
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,153
...I would have done the same.

329
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,916
One Issue whlch troubles me...

330
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,154
...I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

331
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,914
What would you llke to happen?

332
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,794
You know why I do thls.

333
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,552
I want securlty for my famlly.

334
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,994
Then you have It.

335
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,676
Three mllllon for three months.
That was our agreement.

336
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,832
Extended annually, 12 mllllon a year.

337
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,236
Call It 15.

338
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,197
Open-ended.

339
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,276
Would that be agreeable?

340
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,439
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us rlled up In our dally llves...

341
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:41,229
...Is to help each other put a flnger
on what our relapse trlggers mlght be...

342
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,111
...head off our dlsease before
It comes back.

343
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,111
So, anyone?

344
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,349
Free IIcence to bltch and moan.
How often do you get that?

345
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,877
Jesse, last tlme, you seemed down
about your Job at the Laundromat.

346
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,919
Let me ask somethlng. If you had the
chance to do anythlng you wanted...

347
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,592
...what would you do?

348
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,474
Make more green, man. A lot more.

349
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,598
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

350
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,636
I don't know.

351
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:23,391
I guess I would make somethlng.

352
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,358
lee what?

353
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,708
I don't know If It even matters...

354
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,673
...but work wlth my hands, I guess.

355
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:40,311
Bulldlng thlngs, llke carpentry
or brlcklaylng or somethlng?

356
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:45,758
I took thls vo-tech class In hlgh school,
woodworklng.

357
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,471
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because It was Just a blg Jerk-off.

358
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:55,155
But thls one tlme, I had thls teacher
by the name of...

359
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,039
...Mr. Plke.

360
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,037
I guess he was llke a Marlne
or somethlng before he got old.

361
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,269
He was hard of hearlng.

362
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,627
My project for hls class...

363
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:13,553
...was to make thls wooden box.

364
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:17,394
You know, llke a small--

365
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,998
Just llke a--
lee a box, you know, to put stuff In.

366
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,788
So I wanted to get the thlng done
as fast as posslble.

367
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:28,911
l flgured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester...

368
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:34,392
...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thlng.

369
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,313
So I flnlshed It In a couple days.

370
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,553
And It looked pretty lame,
but It worked...

371
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:44,791
...you know,
for puttlng stuff In or whatnot.

372
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,717
So when I showed It to Mr. Plke...

373
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,070
...for my grade...

374
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:56,790
...he looked at It and sald:

375
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,311
'Is that the best you can do?‘

376
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,309
At flrst I thought to myself,
'Hell yeah, bltch.

377
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:08,997
Now glve me a D and shut up
so I can go blaze one wlth my boys.‘

378
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,558
I don't know.
Maybe It was the way he sald II, but...

379
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,949
It was llke he wasn't exactly
saylng It sucked.

380
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,274
He was Just asklng me honestly,
'Is that all you got?‘

381
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,789
And for some reason,
I thought to myself:

382
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:34,909
'Yeah, man, I can do better,‘
so I started from scratch.

383
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:37,957
I made another, then another.

384
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,828
And by the end of the semester,
by llke box number flve...

385
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,714
...I had bullt thls thlng.

386
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,630
You should have seen It.
It was Insane.

387
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:55,508
I mean, I bullt It out of Peruvlan walnut
wlth Inlald zebrawood.

388
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,318
It was fltted wlth pegs, no screws.

389
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:01,358
l sanded It for days
untll It was smooth as glass.

390
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,158
Then I rubbed all the wood wlth tung oll
so It was rlch and dark.

391
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,872
It even smelled good.

392
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,158
You know, you put nose In It
and breathed In, It was--

393
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,157
It was perfect.

394
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,471
What happened to the box?

395
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:27,032
I gave It to my mom.

396
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,797


397
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,110
You know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

398
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,271
It's never too late.

399
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,518
They have art co-ops
that offer classes...

400
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,109
...adult extenslon programme
at the unlverslty.

401
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,989
You know,
I dldn't glve the box to my mom.

402
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,432
I traded It for an ounce of weed.

403
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,390
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

404
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,437
They'll say they're not denylng
coverage.

405
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,998
No, no, I'm agreelng wlth you.

406
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,720
But I went through all thls wlth Walt.

407
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,799
You'll burn through your savlngs,
and then what?

408
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,915
Well, you two managed, rlght?

409
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,194
You sald yourself...

410
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,635
...that Elllot and Gretchen's money
dldn't cover everythlng.

411
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,908
-Jesus, I gotta get back.
-What? No.

412
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,398
No, no, no, you should rest.

413
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,438
Look, why don't you go In
and take a long bath?

414
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,114
-I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
-I wanna be there In case he wakes up.

415
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,192
Wlth all they're glvlng hlm,
he'll sleep tlll mornlng.

416
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,989
-Hey, Sky.
-Hey.

417
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,749
-What are you dolng here?
-Thought I'd stop by...

418
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,308
...to see how you're holdlng up.
Is thls a bad tlme?

419
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,913


420
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,276

440
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,355
Can we Just talk for a mlnute?

441

455
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,633
-Is there some reason for secrecy?
-Later. Not now.

00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,917
-Skyler, Just tell me--
-You really wanna do thls now?

457
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:47,434
Are you gonna make me do thls

458
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,269
Yeah, you're rlght.

459
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,828
Bad Idea to come here.

460
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,352
Ted, I'm--

461
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,111
I'll see you In a day or two.

462
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,438
Back at the offlce.

463
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,869
Take as much tlme as you want.

464
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:21,272
I can't belleve
you had to crush the RV.

465
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,319
Must've been, llke, depresslng.

466
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:27,118
For real. That's a stone loss.

467
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,997
No one mlsses It more than me.

468
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,754
Free to cook anytlme, anywhere.

469
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,559
No quotas, no one to answer to.

470
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,989
What's the polnt of belng an outlaw
when you got responslbllltles?

471
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,074
Darth Vader had responslbllltles.
He was responslble for the Death Star.

472
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:47,037
True that. Two of them bltches.

473
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,032
Just saylng. Devll's advocate.

474
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,273
I gotta pay taxes? What's up wlth that?
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

475
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,590
-Church.
-nght.

476
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,073
Let's klck It back Into gear.
All rlght? Let's start sllnglng agaln.

477
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,317
-Let's do It. LIfe's too short, I say.
-Hel|s yeah, bltches.

478
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,632
We don't need no RV. All we need Is
a blcycle, some Drano, soda bottles.

479
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,076
No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

480
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,390
AIn't top-shelf,
but we could at least move It.

481
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,120
Stlll klnd of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

482
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,271
And who says we sell on the street?

483
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:29,669
Maybe I know a whole new market.

484
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,798
Maybe all we need Is the meth.

485
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,913
What's the yleld?

486
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,992
Hey.

487
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,996
The yleld. Come on.

488
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:17,353
Two-oh-one-polnt-elght.

489
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,830
I see a couple new faces.

490
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,753
Anybody wanna Introduce
themselves?

491
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:43,115
Don't all speak at once.

492
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,429
Yeah.

493
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,877
So my name's Brandon.

494
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,158
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
somethlng about yourself?

495
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:03,436
Well, why I'm here...

496
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,831
...lt's Just one thlng.

497
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,277
It's meth.

498
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,998
It's bad.

499
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,879
Thought I had It klcked a couple tlmes,
you know.

500
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,952
But then, Jesus...

501
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:24,071
...thls new verslon of It
hlt the streets...

502
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,071
-...and, wow.
-Not that blue stuff.

503
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,034
Oh, sorry. I dldn't ralse my hand.

504
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,111
No, go ahead. Thls Is what we do.

505
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,840
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

506
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,153
-You had It too?
-Yeah, bro.

507
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,595
l wlsh I never even heard of It.

508
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:44,432
It was llke llghtlng my whole head
on flre.

509
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,159
Yeah. That stuff wlll burn you down.

510
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:52,109
Only reason I have a hope In hell
Is because It's long gone.

511
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,958
That's the shame of It.

512
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,793
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

513
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,870
I hear It's back In town.

514
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,189
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

515
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,956
It's gonna be okay.

516
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,435
lswear to God, I'll do It.
I wlll go to the press.

517
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,434
I'll go to 40 Hours. I'll go to nghtllne.
Don't know If there's nghtllne anymore.

518
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,751
Doesn't matter. They wlll all take It
and they wlll run wlth It...

519
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:37,710
...because he Is a hero and he Is not
golng to be In a wheelchalr at 43.

520
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,630
Jesus.

521
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,556
Llsten, Marle.

522
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,278
I know Skyler's
already told you thls...

523
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:53,398
...but If there's ever anythlng
that you need, anythlng at all....

524
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,315
It's good to have you here.

525
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,597
Both of you.

526
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,951
IJust wlsh there was somethlng more
that we could do.

527
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,278
Walt.

528
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,357
We can always pay thelr bllls.

529
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,875
Please,
It's tens of thousands of dollars.

530
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,748
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned It.

531
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:27,911
-Skyler.
-l thlnk MarIe should know the truth.

532
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,867
Skyler, I really don't thlnk
thls Is a good Idea.

533
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,713
-l thlnk that--
-He earned It gambllng.

534
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,310
...we've had our problems lately.
You know that.

535
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,793
And what It all came down to really...

536
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,837
...WII money.

537
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,230
Pure and slmple.

538
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,914
When Walt was dlagnosed...

539
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,516
...It changed hlm.

540
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,832
And looklng back, I don't thlnk
I ever really understood...

541
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:10,433
...what It was
that he was golng through.

542
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,068
It was more than faclng death.

543
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,356
It was knowlng
that he was gonna leave behlnd...

544
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,992
...nothlng.

545
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:25,227
And so that's how thls all started.
For better or worse...

546
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,836
...he wanted to provlde.

547
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,951
And so he pald hls medlcal bllls
the only way he knew how.

548
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,875
I thought that Elllot and Gretchen
pald for your treatment.

549
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,995
Yeah, I thought so too.

550
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,356
The truth Is he never took thelr money.
Not a dlme.

551
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,758
He was too proud to take
what he consldered to be charlty.

552
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:51,828
Isn't that rlght?

553
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,918
So he put hls mlnd to It and....

554
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,919
Well, you know how Walt ls.

555
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,990
He's a problem-solver.

556
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,914
And he read books and he dld
a whole bunch of research...

557
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,709
...and he came up wlth thls system.

558
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,677
A system?

559
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,790
A system for countlng cards
In blackjack.

560
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:27,110
What do you mean, llke Raln Man?

561
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,672
Well, I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the detalls...

562
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,834
...but he was convlnced that If he put
enough money Into It, he'd have a--

563
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,797
God, what Is It?

564
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,633
A statlstlcal edge?

565
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,829
Yes, statlstlcal--

566
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:47,671
.80..
-Yeah.

567
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,277
So he, every spare mlnute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

568
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:56,512
And at flrst he went to the caslnos,
but then he reallsed that--

569
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:04,234
But then he reallsed that the caslnos
report your wlnnlngs to the IRS.

570
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:06,867
And If It gets reported,
your famlly mlght flnd out.

571
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,033
If you do not want your famlly to flnd
out, you flnd another place to gamble.

572
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,432
lee an Illegal backroom game.

573
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,632
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take...

574
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,918
...all that tlme he used to spend
away from home?

575
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:29,833
I guess for a couple months there...

576
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:33,071
...you were sort of
leadlng a double llfe, weren't you?

577
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:38,516
Oh, my God.

578
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:42,670
Oh, my God, your fugue state.

579
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,792
-Was that some sort of cover?
-No, no.

580
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,030
He dld not take that, Marle.

581
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,667
The nlght that Walt dlsappeared...

582
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,431
...he lost $14,000.

583
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:02,715
It was hls penslon fund,
our savlngs...

584
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,034
...baslcally every last dlme
we had to our name, gone.

585
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:11,233
He couldn't llve wlth It.

586
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:13,230


587
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:18,075
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospltal...

588
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,758
...he went rlght back to gambllng.
I mean, that's how deep thls went.

589
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,750
How could you do that to her, Walt?

590
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,749
Anyway, thls system of hls?

591
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:36,913
He flnally got It to work.

592
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,233
So all thls Is to say
we have the money.

593
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:45,277
No more gambllng.

594
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:48,955
But we have the money.

595
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,997
How much money?

596
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,952
Walt?

597
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,237
Well...

598
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:10,037
...lt's Into seven flgures.

599
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,231
Holy Mary, mother of God.

600
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,872
What can I say?

601
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:19,955
ldld very well.

602
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:22,751
Marle...

603
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:26,995
...you wlll take our money.

604
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,190
Use It to take care of Hank.

605
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,668
Please. Marle, let us help.

606
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,790
-Does Walt, Jr. know about thls?
-Absolutely not.

607
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,950
And I need to keep It that way.

608
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,793
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on hls mlnd rlght now.

609
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,350
-Can we please keep thls between us?
-Yeah. Yeah, l--

610
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,353
Yeah, l]ust-- I need to--

611
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,512
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about It later.

612
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,120
How dld you come up wlth that?

613
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,833
I mean, where dld you possIny--?

614
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,750
I learned from the best.

615
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,150


616
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,316
...somethlng tells me that Hank
Is here because of you.

617
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,948
And I'm not forgettlng that.
