00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,392
All it would take is one friend...

ripping and running again.

80
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,396

...| just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

180
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:30,988
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

181
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,113
And I think having her mother around

00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,028


185
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,151
Mom'a even talking

186
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,796
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

187
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,108
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

188
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,037

My little girl, huh?

193
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,150
Hey, do you wanna see something?

194

That's right. Daddy did that.

203

Daddy did that for you.

204
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,757
This place looks exactly the same.

205
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,156
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

206
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,792
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,911
-Get out.
-No. You took the ataah.

208
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,997
I heard all thoae meaaagea,
flgured It out.

209
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,033
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

210
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:03,834
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something...

211
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,429
-...and you were the one who took ltl
-Shut up.

212
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,149
You lower your voice.

213
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,715
"Like you dropped the ball"?

214
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:20,514
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

215
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,108
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

216
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,391
What was that, heroin?

217
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,314
Jeaua.

218
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,074
l was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off--

219
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,474
'Day off'?
We were on call, you junkle.

220
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,671
On call for the blggeat deal
of our llvea.

221
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,110
| just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

222
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,232
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

223
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,793
Son of a bitch.

224
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:51,828
How much?

225
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,595
-How much what?
-How much did you get for the deal?

226
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,956
One-point-two million.

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,478
Six hundred thousand each.

228
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,398
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

229
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,035
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

230
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,756
All right.
So where'a my money?

231
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,353
What?

232
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,270
You are joking, right?

233
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,189
If I gave you that money...

234
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,469
...you would be dead
lnalde of a week.

235
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,072
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

236
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,510
I didn't even like It anyway.
It made me alck.

237
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,550
And the.... And the meth.

238
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:38,957
You know, I could take it or leave it.

239
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,627

No, huh?

246
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:11,913
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend...

00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,952
...on the klndneaa of atrangera
to get high.

248

00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,838
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

251
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,553

Wait a minute. You're not asking

267
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,517
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

268

00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,990
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

283
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,919
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

Haven't you ever seen White Heat?

290
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,432
Yeah, I've seen White Heat...

00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:30,437

00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:33,199

There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money...

299
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,391
...down by the railroad tracks."

300
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,034

307
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,068
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

308
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,714
No, I earned that money, me.

Who do you wanna be?

514
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,591
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

515
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,951
-Is New Zealand part of Australia?
-New Zealand is New Zealand.

516
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,195
Right on.

517
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,393
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

518
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,239
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

519
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:19,430
And I can be a bush pilot.

520
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,108
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

521
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,233
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

522
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,791
But first, we gotta get clean.

523
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,877
And not becauae

524
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,789
-We do thla for ua, right?
-Yeah. Abaolutely. For ua.

525
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,833
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

526
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,028
We're not.

527
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,628
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

528
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,354
We're way better than that. I say....

529
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,234
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

530
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,431
Yeah, we can do that.

531
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,638
Deflnltely.

532
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:08,397


533
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,317
What can I get you?

534
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,351
Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.

535
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,793
Damn It.

536
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:34,151
Hey, honey.

537
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,909
No. I don't know what to tell you.

538
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,238
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

539
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,990
Well, do they have
to be dlapera for newborna?

540
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,952
What If we went up a alze
and juat kind of....

541
00:37:48,759 --> 00:37:50,670
All right, all right. No, I understand.

542
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,758
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

543
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:57,474
l'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so....

544
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,314
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

545
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,078
Thank you.

546
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,232


547
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,312
Well played.

548
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,710
They found water on Mars.

549
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:21,034
They have Indeed.

550
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,591
Don't know what to do
with that Information...

551
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:26,154
...but, hey, God bleaa them,
they found It.

552
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,435
Oh, well, actually...

553
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,155
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

554
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,398
...and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

555
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,751
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

556
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,678
So lt'a a....

557
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,314
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

558
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,230
-To water on Mara.
-To water on Mara.

559
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,152

564
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,433
How old?

565
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,039
Old enough to know better.

566
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:15,750
Twenty-seven next month.

567
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,310

-Juat the one.

568
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,758
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he'a almoat 16.

569
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,915
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

570
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,392
But he helps out, though.

571
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,353
He'a even changlng aome dlapera
now, ao....

572
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,631
It's more than I managed to do
when l was his age.

573
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,273
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

574
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,597
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

575
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,031
So, any advice?

576
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,718
Having a daughter. Any advice?

577
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,352
No, not really. Just love them.

578
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,117
Juat-- Yeah.

579
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,710
I mean, they are who they are.

580
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,833
Yeah.

581
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,919
I've got this nephew.

582
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,955
Thla nephew who la--
I mean, he'a an adult.

583
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,234
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

584
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:27,149
But atlll, I mean,
there la that fruatratlon.

585
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,792
You know, that....

586
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:32,230
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

587
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:36,318
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

588
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,430
But of course, they don't.

589
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,028
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

590
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,032
Famlly?

591
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,156
Yeah. Famlly.

592
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,229
You can't give up on them. Never.

593
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:59,351
I mean, what else is there?

594
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,193
Jeaae, lt'a me.

595
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,076
