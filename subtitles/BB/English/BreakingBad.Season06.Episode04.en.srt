...I should sue someone.
That's what happened.

53
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,316
So I'm on my way to the drugstore,
and l have to stop to get some gas...

54
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,352

You know what?
She shouldn't be In thls room.

56
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,394
I mean, thls ls supposedly green,
but you know how It Is.

57
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,831
You can close the wlndows
In the nursery...

58
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,553
...because It's really
only out here.

59
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,747
Thls Is as good as It gets.

60
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,751


61
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,795
...pump mall'unctlon?

You know, the pump's nozzle.

64
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,436
The metal thlng.
The thlng you squeeze?

65
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,679
I hear a chunk.
So, I suppose, In my nalvete

66
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,235
...I took to understand that gas Is
no longer comlng out of the nozzle...

67
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,318
...so I pull out the hose to put It back

I checked wlth my gal at A.P.D.

I'm wonderlng what you wanna do

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,039
-No Idea.
-No?

170
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,115
You were Just out talklng to hlm
In the parklng lot.

171
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,037
I'm sorry. Were you spylng on me?

172
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,433
Yes.

173
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,234
And I feel Just awl'ul about It too.

174
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,038
You know, I played along...

175
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,071
...wlth your pump mall'unctlon
bullshlt...

176
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,315
...because Junlor
was standlng rlght there...

177
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,398
...but now I would llke to know
what's golng on.

178
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,267
Flrst of all, It's no blg deal.

179
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:17,437
Comlng here Is Just me
belng overly cautlous.

180
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,149
Jesse Plnkman, you know?

181
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,314
He came over to our house
that tlme l'or dlnner, remember?

182
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,115
Well, he.... He got upset over thls....

183
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,594
Somethlng he thlnks l dld.

184
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,715
I dld do It.

185
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,674
But I dld It for very good reasons.
And It's Just-- It's compllcated.

186
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,836
Walt, are you...?

187
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,479
Are you telllng me that he trled to...

188
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:52,513
...burn our house down?

189
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,670
That was...

190
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,033
...probably, for a brlel' moment,
hls Intentlon...

191
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,833
...but, obvlously, he changed hls mlnd.

192
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,237
And how does that work?

193
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,874
Hlm--? Hlm changlng hls mlnd?

194
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,118


195
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,958
Look....

196
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,110
You've got to understand
that wlth Jesse...

197
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,713
...there are emotlonal Issues,
personal Issues, some drug abuse.

198
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,754
But he has always been more
of a danger to hlmsell' than anyone else.

199
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:34,555
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle, that's all.

200
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:38,593
So he has never hurt anybody?

201
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,114


202
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,596
I can't belleve
you got her down so fast.

203
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,358


204
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,229
...what's your course of actlon here?

205
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,192
Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks hlm down,
whlch shouldn't take long...

206
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,833


207
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,192
I'm gonna talk to hlm.

208
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,791
Make hlm see reason.

209
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,878
Talk to hlm?

210
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,791
Make hlm see reason?

211
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,397
So I'm clear...

212
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,394
...these are Just euphemlsms...

213
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,591
...you're uslng here, rlght?

214
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,349


215
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,667
What?

216
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,311
Wh--? What does that mean?

217
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,637
My God.
I knew thls was golng to happen.

218
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,400
I knew It. I told you that someday...

219
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:48,392
...someone was golng to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

220
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,828
And now here we are.

221
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,028


222
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,429
Jesse dldn't go there to hurt anyone.

223
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:56,711
He poured gasollne
all over our house, Walt.

224
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,149
He trled to set our house on I'lre.

225
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,351
He changed hls mlnd.
He dldn't do It, dld he?

226
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,437
What II' he changes It back?

227
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,157
Walt, you need...

228
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,839
...to deal wlth thls.

229
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:13,469
How much have you had to drlnk?

230
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,148
Not nearly enough.

231
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,078
I don't know how we got off...

232
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,430
...on whatever It Is
we're talklng about here...

233
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,432
...but, clearly, I haven't explalned
the sltuatlon well enough...

234
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:26,470
...because thls Is a blg overreactlon.

235
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,195
We all need to Just take a deep breath
and calm down...

236
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,153
...because Jesse Isn't Just some....

237
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,318
Some-- Some rabld dog.

238
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,990
-Thls Is a person.
-A person that Is a threat to us.

239
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,399
I mean, my God, where we are now
wlth Hank and Marle...

240
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,636
...and that awful tape we made.

241
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,115
After everythlng we've done...

242
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,628
...you can't Just talk to thls person.

243
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,354
You're saylng...

244
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,755

245
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:05,075
What--? What exactly are you saylng?

248
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,237
What's one more?

249
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,595

250
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,189
Stop what you're dolng

251
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:14,509
You wanna--?
You wanna know what he dld?

You wanna hear about It?

253
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,554
Jesse, put out the llghter.

254
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,432
He polsoned a llttle kld.

255
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,354
An 8-year-old boy.

256
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,470
Just because, you know--

257
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,113
Just as a move!

258
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,628
Walt's a bastard. Secret's out.

259
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:30,868
We'll talk about It.

260
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,832
But I need you to put out

261
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,588

So put It out.

You really wanna burn hlm down?

269
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,271

00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,274
...and now you're sad and hurt

291
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,799
To be thls wrong about someone.

00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:15,796
Thls oft.

293
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,911
We all lead double llves

-We all have our secrets.
-Yeah. Not llke thls.

l sald I can't do that.

299
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,795
It'd be bad for Hank.

The detalls don't really matter, do they?
There's nothlng to be done, okay?

314
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,871
He screwed us and he won.

315
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,358

How's work?

319
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,591
Last week, you were upset
about the new parklng rules.

320
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,153
Marle?

321
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,870
Saxltoxln.

322
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,469
Derlved I'rom shelll'lsh.

323
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,831
Produces a I'laccld paralysls

324
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,678
...through a progresslon of symptoms.

325
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,357
Death occurs from resplratory I'allure.

326
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,471
Marle...

327
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,671
...you're not ready to I'lll me In here...

328
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,478

But I want you to llsten.

00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,077
...or palnl'ul or seemlngly unsolvable...

332
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,111
...that vlolence won't make worse.

333
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,038


334
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,672
Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody.

335
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,358
l]ust....

336
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,956
It Just feels good to thlnk about It.

337
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,955
-Hey, babe.
-What's the story here?

338
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,990
Oh, well, somethlng's come up.

339
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,112
I thought you mlght wanna
get out of the house for a day or two.

340
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,674
You thought I'd pack up
and move out of my own house.

341
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,107
Why? What's golng on?
