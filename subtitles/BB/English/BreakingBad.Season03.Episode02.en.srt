Pepper-spray the man who's expresslng

40
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,516
Lastly a llttle somethlng from
down El Paso way.

41
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:30,753
Border Patrol came across multlple
homlcldes Just thls slde ol' the border.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,834
Truck turns out to be a chlcken run
out of Juarez Into Laredo.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,070
Border Patrol's been playlng
hlde-and-seek...

44
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,958
...wlth these polleros for two years.

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,237
But thls tlme, soon as they made It
across, someone hlt them.

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,753
Hlt them hard.

47
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,276
We're talklng a drlver and nlne Illegals.
No slgn ol' the shooters.

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,670
So thls truck was carrylng more
than Just people.

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,796
What are we looklng at,
weed, coke or meth?

50
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,679
No, doesn't look llke
they were transportlng narcotlcs.

51
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,637
Why'd the Border Patrol
klck thls to us?

52
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,676

You ask me, thls ls hlgh-end
cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe.

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,792
Questlon ls, why do we have

55
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,790
...on our slde ol' the DMZ?

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,235
They sendlng a message?
Clearlng a path?

57
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,077
Or was thls about stopplng
one partlcular border-hopper?

58
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:17,948
Maybe one of those extra-crlsples
knew somethlng he shouldn't.

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,311
All rlght, that's lt. Slow news day.

Flnally the blg money shows up

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,074
We're here to dlscuss the sale of
the property at 9809 Margo.

322
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,511
I get It. Flat-fee cllents, am I rlght?

323
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,319
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

324
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:01,949
I represent a cllent
who shall remaln nameless.

325
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,598
However, for our purposes...

326
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,990
...you mlght Just as well vlsuallse
a large bag of money.

327
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:11,277
Thls Indlvldual wants
to buy your house today for cash.

328
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,113
-Cash?
-Cash. I know, In thls economy.

329
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,999
The money Is already burnlng a hole
In my cllent's account.

330
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,357
You can ask Mr. Gardlner. I've shown
hlm all the pertlnent flnanclals.

331
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,954
It's the only reason
we're slttlng here.

332
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,075
Falr enough. We get a few papers
slgned and notarlsed...

333
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,991
...we can take care of thls rlght now.

334
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,913
In fact, I could wlre you your money
thls very afternoon.

335
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:35,556
There's Just one llttle halr
In the soup.

336
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,671
The prlce.

337
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,148
We feel 875 Is very falr.

338
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,471
But I suppose there's always
a llttle wlggle room.

339
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,471
Well, why don't you wlggle us on down
to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?

340
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,276
Four hundred thousand?
What Is that, a Joke?

341
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,396
No, that's my offer.

342
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,710
That's less than half-prlce.

343
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,871
We put that much
Into the renovatlons alone.

344
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,758
Why don't we Just cut
the clown act...

345
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,878
...and you tell us what you're wllllng
to come up to?

346
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,600
Four hundred thousand.
That's my flnal offer.

347
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,034
-Waste of tlme.
-Rldlculous.

348
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,555
How could you posslbly lmaglne
we'd entertaln thls?

349
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,038
-Come on, hon.
-I don't know.

350
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,397
I thought some allowance was In order
once I heard about the meth lab.

351
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,039
That used to be In the basement.

352
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,158
I looked over your slgned dlsclosure
statements...

353
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,675
...and I don't see any mentlon
of a meth lab. Nope.

354
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,990
Oh, you got your termlte Inspectlon.
That's good.

355
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,513
But no meth lab.

356
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,992
Now, some would call that fraud
In servlce of conceallng a felony.

357
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,314
I, myself, am more open-mlnded.
But It Is trlcky.

358
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,674
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your coJones.

359
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,477
I mean, good try...

360
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,837
...at sneaklng a meth-contamlnated
property past a buyer.

361
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:54,469
I mean, could've been a good deal
for you. Too bad.

362
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,873
Now, I could flle a sult and encumber
thls property lndeflnltely.

363
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,190
Or I could start some crlmlnal
proceedlngs.

364
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:05,351
But I don't thlnk any of us want that,
now, do we?

365
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,875
How about It, counsellor?
Do you concur?

366
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,828
There you go, son.

367
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,437
Come on. It's not Devll's Island.

368
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,711
Okay.

369
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:54,753
-Oh, hey.

370
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,194
-Brought plzza.
-Yeah. Well, I'm maklng dlnner.

371
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,708
Okay, I'll Just put It In the frldge.
It's even better the next day.

372
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:12,948
HI, honey.

373
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,352
Sorry.

374
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,713
Skyler.

375
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,548
I mean, what klnd of example do
we want to set here, rlght?

376
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:33,792
I mean, can't we at least Just slt down
and eat a plece of plzza together?

377
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:36,712
Just hash thlngs out llke adults?

378
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,313
We have dlscussed everythlng
we need to dlscuss.

379
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,277
I thought I made myself very clear.

380
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,954

381
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,671

383
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,588

to get the newspaper...

384
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,671
...I saw a plzza on our roof.

385
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,400
Would you know anythlng about that?

386
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,711
Llsten to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.

387
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,476
Calm down, accept the sltuatlon
and keep your dlstance.

388
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:38,155

Breaklng even Is not so bad.

392
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,157
In thls economy, a lot of people
would klll to break even.

393
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:17,951
Poor Jake. He had hls heart set
