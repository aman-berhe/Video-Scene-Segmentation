1
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,829
Son of a....

2
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,955
I'm not laavlng.

3
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,272
Walt, I'm not leaving.

4
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,713
Oh, my God.

5
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,468
I can hear your cell phone ringing.

6
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,832
This is ridiculous. I can't....

7
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,197
What is going on with you?
I've left you, like, 23 messages.

8
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,358
-And?
-And?

9
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,307
We need to talk about the car wash.

10
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,954
Skylar,
now I: not a good time for ma, okay?

11
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,754
-Can we talk about this later?
-No, okay? We can't.

12
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,118
Why are you doing--?

13
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,472
Oh, Jesus.

14
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,513
-What happened?
-Nothing. ljust bumped it. That's all.

15
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,233
Okay, l'm-- I'm coming in.

16
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,189
Okay.

17
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,119
Exactly what happened?

18
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,590
It's complicated
and I don't wish to discuss It.

19
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,677
-lt's none of your concern.
-Are you In danger?

20
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,193
Walt.

21
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:31,708
Wait, I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me right now.

22
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,149
-Are you In danger?
-You know what?

23
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,837
Let's just say that l have a hell
of a lot more on my mind right now...

24
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,838
...than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,075
Okay?

26
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,156
So if you could you just--

27
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,156
Please.

28
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,952
Okay.

29
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,033
Okay. Then we go to the police.

30
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,754
-What?
-We tell them everything.

31
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,031
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety...

32
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,277
...and the safety of your family
and you need help.

33
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,716
-What cholce Is there?
-What cholce?

34
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,114
If you're in danger then it would be--

35
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,470
Wait, wait, stop, stop. Stop.

36
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,148
You keep saying that word.
'Danger.' 'Danger.'

37
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,873
-But you said--
-No, l have never used that word.

38
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,877
I said "complicated"
and then you flew off the handle.

39
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,991
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when I saw that.

40
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,838
Okay? Where'd that come from?

41
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,674
A fall in the shower?

42
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,554
This Is Just so passlve-aggresslve,
you know.

43
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,794
Passive-aggressive?

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,436
I go two days without returning
your phone calls, two days...

45
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,757
...and l have one minor little incident,
and now you're telling me...

46
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,473
...that I should turn myself
In to the police!

47
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,829
-A minor Incldent?
-Yes.

48
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,792
What minor little incident?

49
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,709
I had an argument with a coworker,
okay?

50
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,348
And?

51
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,188
I had an argument.

52
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,197
We were in this bar...

53
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,392
...and we were discussing
a particular business strategy.

54
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:13,356
And it got heated and out of control,
and he hit me. Once.

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,552
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

56
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,829
And that's It.

57
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,635
You were in a bar fight?

58
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,153
Yes, Skyler. l was in a bar fight.

59
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,629
So you're okay?

60
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,038
Really?

61
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:42,998
Yes.

62
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,872
I'm okay.

63
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,637
And I think, in the end,
that it may have been a good thing...

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,832
...because we were able to clear the air
and, you know....

65
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,951
Mutual respect, and....

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,358


67
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,271
Frozen peas.

68
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,994
-What?
-lt's the best thing for the swelling.

69
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,555
Oh, it's not really swollen, it's just--

70
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,511


71
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,593
You don't even have ice.

72
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,759
I will get peas, I will get ice.
Peas and ice, I'm writing it down.

73
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,793


74
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,110
I need you to promise me...

75
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,709
...that if things do get dangerous--

76
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,353
-Skyler--
-Promlse me.

77
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,671
Absolutely.

78
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,432


79
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,676
Car wash.

80
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,113
Honey. Charles.

81
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,712
Take a look at this kitchen.

82
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,798
HI there.
Can I answer any questions?

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,355
Yes. Any chance of a top off?

84
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,109
Oh, lthlnk we can
help you out there.

85
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,835
So, what do you think?

86
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,997
Oh, very nice. Very open.

87
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,350
Oh, I agree. It flows.

88
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,675
Whole lot of natural light.

89
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,073
Michael Kilbourne.

90
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,748
-Tor| Costner.
-lt's nice to meet you.

91
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,588
Well, three bedrooms, one and a half
baths on just under half an acre.

92
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,438
There's a non-attached caslta
out In back.

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,996
Permlt useable as office
or guest sulte.

94
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,552
Plank wood floors.

95
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,112
Central heat and air.

96
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,317
I see you're marrled.

97
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,077
No, dlvorced.

98
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,508
Very recent.

99
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,551
-Old hablts.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,035
-But any children?
-Yes, as a matter of fact. A little boy.

101
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,639
Oh, how old?

102
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,877
He turned 4 in May. He's a Gemini.
Would love this yard.

103
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,990
Oh, plenty of space for a jungle gym.

104
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,838
And the neighbourhood preschool
is fantastic.

105
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,274
lthlnk Ell |s going to be
homeschooled.

106
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,549
-Well, great.
-Not for religious reasons.

107
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,035
I wanna make sure
he's getting attention.

108
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:18,992
He'll still go to summer camp
and whatnot, playdates.

109
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,316
-Don't want him to be socially awkward.
-Makes sense.

110
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,358
He tests very highly, 96 percentile.

111
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,473
But that whole right brain, left brain.
You want those in balance.

112
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,714
Oh, yeah.

113
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,389
You said the casita has plumbing?

114
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,387
I work a lot with clay,
sol need access to running water.

115
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,432
Well, It's plpe fitted
for a quarter bath so....

116
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,915
Make a perfect studio.

117
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,995
This could work.

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,117
Hell, that's the doctor's plan
to get her patients at ease.

119
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,352
If you know what I mean.

120
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,787
But, nurse--

121
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,830
Hello? I'm back.

122
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,472
That's okay.

123
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,068
-Hank?
-Yeah.

124
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,915
I had to go to three places
to get the moisturizer that you like.

125
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,314
But I got that.

126
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,398
And I got your Shlner Bock
and your chips.

127
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,591
And I couldn't resist.

128
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,591
The complete encyclopaedia
to fantasy football.

129
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,430
-Look, it has all the latest rankings.
-Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos.

130
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,629
Wait, I....

131
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,990
I said Cheetos, like, 10 times.
You need me to write it down?

132
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,919
No, and I don't need you to be mean
about it either.

133
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,908
Well, I'm just saying, you know,
I said Cheetos...sound.

134
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,112
Virtually impossible to confuse
Cheetos with Fritos, seems to me.

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,233
-Where are you going?
-l-- Back to the store, I guess.

136
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:56,792
Here.

137
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,832
And the draft's not for two months,
so this is useless.

138
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,991
Can you believe It?

139
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,437
What?

140
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,915
What? This.

141
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:28,072
Well, you always said this place
could be bugged.

142
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,190
-Now we know.
-Yeah, well.

143
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,358
I don't like It.

144
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,948
It's a violation of the work space.

145
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,553
Yeah, I guess.

146
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,949
You wanna do something?

147
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:43,672
Do something?

148
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,472
Like what?

149
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,836
Go-karts?

150
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,672
Go-karts. What--?

151
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,829
Yeah, there's a track
down by the Coliseum.

152
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,950
It's pretty fun.

153
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,237
No, actually I have
some kind of a meeting, so....

154
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,588
All right, whatever.

155
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,154
Raln check?

156
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,669
Yeah. Sure.

157
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,958
How you doing?

158
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,959
-Good.
-Yeah?

159
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,116
You okay?

160
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:39,956
Is there anything
we should talk about?

161
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,311
How's your eye?

162
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,949
Yeah, It's fine.

163
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,152
Anything we should talk about?

164
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,995
For what it's worth...

165
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,034
...getting the shit kicked out of you...

166
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,434
...not to say you get used to it...

167
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,279
...but you do kind of get used to it.

168
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,035
Two words: nail salon.

169
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,273
Perfect for money laundering.

170
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:35,391
It's a high-volume business
with a discreet work force.

171
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
I mean, nobody does,
'Mlster, me know nothlng'...

172
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,714
...better than Mrs. Mookjalaporn
and her gals.

173
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,319
Mr. Goodman--

174
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,508


175
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,789
Now, for the lady of the house.

176
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,149
Drum roll.
How about a lifetime supply...

177
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:50,509
...of French manlcures
and enzyme peels?

178
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,756
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Pinch yourself.

179
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,031
We're not buying a nail salon,
Mr. Goodman.

180
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,276
-We're getting the car wash.
-l'm sorry.

181
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,597
Am I missing something here?
Didn't you already try that?

182
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,078
Yeah. I mean, Walt told me that you
took a run at this Bogdan character...

183
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,192
...and he wrestled you into submission
with his eyebrows.

184
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,197
Ten million,
that was the asking price, rlght?

185
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,153
Apparently, he upped it to 20.

186
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,154
Nice negotiating. Yeah, I mean,
hey, you bombed. It happens.

187
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,513
You were smart to call me. Now--

188
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,951
You just sit back, relax
and let a professional take over.

189
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,037
That's for me. Excuse me.

190
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,955
What do you want? I'm in a meeting.

191
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,993
Why didn't you think of that before?
It's not my....

192
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,191
I'm In a meeting.

193
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,315
Can Huell use your bathroom?

194
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,032
Huell?

195
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,511
Sure. The top of the stairs.

196
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,550


197
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,997
It's a stomach thing. lt's....

198
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,030
So where were we?

199
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,910
-Profess|onallsm.
-Yeah.

200
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,475
So if the guy won't sell, he won't sell.

201
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,513
I don't accept that.
I don't accept that he won't sell.

202
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,712
I think he just lacks the proper...

203
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,034
...motlvatlon.

204
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,071
Motlvatlon.

205
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,916
As in, "motivation" motivation? I mean,
just so we're on the same page here...

206
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,953
...are you saying we make him an offer
he can't refuse?

207
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,468
Nothing so dramatic as that, no.

208
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,431
Motlvatlon.

209
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,558
Attitude adjustment.

210
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,158
This one, she's a keeper.

211
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,476
Well,
an audit can be highly motlvatlng.

212
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,432
I know a gal at Tax and Revenue.

213
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,871
You give her 10 minutes,
she'll have his sky raining frogs.

214
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,675
No, we don't want to draw
any unwanted tax attention.

215
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,952
We don't want them looking at us
after Bogdan sells.

216
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,753
All right, how about an ICE raid?

217
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,473
He's got illegals working over there.
He has to.

218
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,228
We are not getting a bunch
of poor innocent people in trouble, no.

219
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,876
Yeah, and also you're gonna need them
after you take over.

220
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,309
Hey, how about terrorism?

221
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,396
"Oh, Agent Hoover, I gotta tell you...

222
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:17,592
...l've seen some real Islamic comings
and goings over there at the car wash.

223
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,475
Yeah, I mean, guys in turbans
pulling up in vans and stuff like that."

224
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,036
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

225
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,314
Okay, well,
we're just spltballlng here, so....

226
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,268
Okay, there's always:

227
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,635
"You got a real nice place here.

228
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,273
Be a shame if something
happened to it." That angle.

229
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,313
What are you talking about?

230
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,791
Vlolence?

231
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,707
Attitude adjustment.

232
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,955
Oh, no. That, no.

233
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,276
That is not at all what I meant.
l-- We do not do that.

234
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,868
That's not who we are, right?

235
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,629
Yeah, no, no, no. She's right.

236
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,797
Look, do I need to state the obvious?

237
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:05,958
I mean, there's gotta be dozens
of car washes in this area.

238
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,593
Who says it has to be this one?

239
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,599


240
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,599
I say It has to.

241
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,278
Why?

242
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,397
I just do.

243
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,238


244
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,352
Well, that clears things up.

245
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,790
I don't like him. Bogdan.

246
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:30,277
He was condescending to me,
rude about you, and I do not like him.

247
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,198
Simple as that.

248
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,669
Hey, nobody appreciates
a passionate woman more than I do.

249
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,598
But in this business--

250
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,836
And Walt can back me up on this.

251
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,111
--the number one rule
is don't take things personally.

252
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,630
What do you mean, rude about me?

253
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,430
Something along the lines
of you weren't man enough...

254
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,551
...to face hlm yourself.

255
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,196
-What?
-That you had to send your woman...

256
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,867
...to do your business for you.

257
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,948
Speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna
go on record and say this is a bad idea.

258
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:13,992
-Now, I advise against--
-lt's this one. It's this one.

259
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,955
Okay, so....

260
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:29,108
All we have to do is think
of a non-violent, unsuspicious way...

261
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,595
...to purchase the car wash,
that protects the innocents...

262
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,109
...and doesn't cost $20 million.

263
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,319
Don't everybody speak at once.

264
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,433
I Ilke It.

265
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:48,992
Yeah.

266
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:57,718


267
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,672
Can I answer any questions?

268
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,590
-Spoons.
-Yes, the owner |s quite the collector.

269
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,552
Aren't they something?
One for each of the 50 states.

270
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,635
Puerto Rico is technically a territory.

271
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,837
You know, maybe they were thinking,
'Someday.‘

272
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,513
So no basement?

273
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,187
-No basement. Sorry.
-That's a problem.

274
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,789
My brother's in the Peace Corps
and won't be back for 18 months...

275
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:28,194
...and I said I'd hang on
to his furnlture.

276
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,915
Well, if you're looking
for storage space, there's an attic area.

277
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,038
Well, an attic might be even better,
as long as it's dry.

278
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:37,718
-Let's take a tour.
-Okay.

279
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,798
Actually, I have a handout for you.

280
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,472
It has all the information.

281
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,591
-l'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way.
-Charlotte Blattner.

282
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,313
-So nice to meet you, Charlotte.
-You too.

283
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,918
So I told him point-blank.

284
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,351
You're my husband and I love you,
but you're 53 years old.

285
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,192
This job has just gotten too stressful
and difficult, and it's time to quit.

286
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:08,471
And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

287
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,592
What a fascinating career
that must have been for him.

288
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,948
It was.

289
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,595
I mean,
NASA was like a second family to us...

290
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,475
...but, you know,
It was time for a new adventure.

291
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,514
So between his pension and the income
I bring in from hand modelling...

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,872
...we're, you know, comfortable.
When were these floors redone?

293
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,196
Two years ago.
The counters are brand-new.

294
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,310
I can tell. Travertine.

295
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,033


296
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,034
-Any children?
-No.

297
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,958
I don't really want kids.

298
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,674
-Is that horrible for me to say?
-Not at all.

299
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,268
Not everyone has to have children.

300
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,113
You should talk to my husband.

301
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,231
Garbage disposal?

302
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,677
Check It out. Score, yo.

303
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,634
-Come on. Come on. What you got?
-You're going down!

304
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,355
I really love your home.

305
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,437
Oh, well, thank you, Mimi.

306
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,949
It has a very European feel.

307
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,549
-You think?
-Oh, I lived In London for years...

308
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,398
...so, yeah, this feels familiar.

309
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,718
Where in London?
I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s.

310
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,989
Downtown,
but we were almost never there.

311
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,954
My husband is an illustrator. We
travelled a lot. Paris, ltaly, Denmark.

312
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,276
It was before the kids were in school,
so it was easy to pick up and go.

313
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,314
That was before my youngest, Lucy,
was diagnosed with endocarditis.

314
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,669
-Oh, my.
-Gosh, Is that--?

315
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:49,155
It's a bacterial Infection
of the heart valves. lt's....

316
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,873
Yeah, It can be....

317
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,637
That's terrlble.

318
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,068
Is she all right?

319
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,233
Your daughter?

320
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,759
Is she okay?

321
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,792
Yes. Thank you.

322
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:05,548
The doctors put in a prosthetic valve
so she's-- Lucy's fine.

323
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,227
Running and walking, riding horses.

324
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,198
-Thank goodness.
-Yeah.

325
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:13,516
We're very lucky.

326
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:22,518
-Excuse me, miss.
-Very nice, thank you.

327
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,075
-I just called the police.
-Okay, then.

328
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,156
I know you stole that spoon.

329
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,998
What are you talking about?

330
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,951
You're a thief.

331
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,671
-Excuse me?
-And a liar.

332
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,074
Making stories up.
What's wrong with you?

333
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,951
No, what's the matter with you?

334
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,514
You better just back off, okay?

335
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,872
-My husband is a DEA agent.
-Oh, I thought he was an astronaut.

336
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,514
Or an Illustrator.
Get your crazy lles stralght.

337
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,756
You know what, fatty?
You are so lucky...

338
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:54,349
-...that I am late for an appointment.
-You're not going anywhere.

339
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,437
-Let go of my purse!
-Not until the police get here.

340
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:58,913
Let It gol

341
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,474
Let It go! Let It gol

342
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,350
You are in big trouble.

343
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,638
Yeah.

344
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,158
Just slow-- Hey, just--
Slow down. Start from the-- You're--

345
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,752
You're where?

346
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,352
Why the f--?

347
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,232
Why are you--?

348
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,717
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?

349
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,395
Jesus, just--

350
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,916
Would you stop crying?

351
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,557
I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight.

352
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,276
Where they got you?

353
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:29,677
So good news.
The officer spoke to the homeowners.

354
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:31,517
They're not gonna press charges.

355
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,597
Good. I won't either.

356
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,670
Okay, then. So we're good to go.

357
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,718
You ready?

358
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,071
Marie, you wanna go home?

359
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,429
Marie?

360
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,269
Yes, it's Skyler White
calling for Saul Goodman, please.

361
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,517
Yes, It Is Important.

362
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,278
Thank you.

363
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,469
Sorry. Same as before.

364
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,998
But this is not right.

365
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:22,918
You cannot shut me down.
You cannot do this.

366
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,349
I've checked your wastewater
Inside and out.

367
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,553
I've checked your runoff gutters,
and now out here, more contaminants.

368
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,831
Ammonla, acetone, benzene,
nltrobenzene.

369
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,030
No, no, no, this is a mistake.

370
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,629
Where is Gary? He'll tell you
my soap is very good, very green.

371
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:41,717
Your soap Is not the Issue,
It's your filtration system.

372
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,114
The very least,
you'll need to retrofit.

373
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,675
But If you're leechlng
Into the groundwater...

374
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:48,870
...which is a real possibility here...

375
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,434
...you're gonna need
to replace your system.

376
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:52,628
Replace?

377
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,911
Do you know what cost that is?
Two hundred thousand dollars.

378
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,393
It's a hardship.

379
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,637
If you like, we can give you
a list of approved vendors.

380
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,514
If you get going, your downtime
shouldn't be any more than five weeks.

381
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,280
Okay. So sorry, you are right.

382
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,031
From now on,
we will be extra careful and clean.

383
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:15,595
-No more pollutlon, okay? Yes?
-No, I'm sorry.

384
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,314
The state requires you to suspend
all activity...

385
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,079
...until these levels
reach the mandated minimums.

386
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,549
-Where is usual man? Where is Gary?
-Got transferred to Las Cruces.

387
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,468
-If you'd like to file an appeal--
-I have done nothing wrong.

388
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,432
Tell me why you shut me down.

389
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,392
-What laws did I break?
-What laws? Several.

390
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,239
Tell me exact speclflc laws or I refuse.
Right now.

391
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,880
-Tell me what laws I broke.
-The specific laws....

392
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,718
Hold on, okay, hold on, hold on.

393
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,750
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

394
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,316
Okay. The New Mexico
Hazardous Waste Act of 1978...

395
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,273
...sectlon 74, chapter four,
part 13 states:

396
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,756
"Whenever the disposal
of solid or hazardous waste presents--"

397
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,076
--an lmmlnent
or substantial endangerment...

398
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,871
...the offender may be fined...

399
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,390
...not more than $5000 each day
in which the violation occurs.

400
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,714
All right, okay.

401
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,593
Now the....

402
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,112
Okay, baby.

403
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,078
All right. The EPA can cite him
under the Toxic Substances--

404
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,031
--Control Act of 1976.

405
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,276
U.S. code, title 15, chapter 53--

406
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,469
'--subchapter 1--'

407
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,874
--sectlon 2606.

408
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,952
Satlsfled?

409
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,672
Was that specific--

410
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:33,471
--specific enough for you?

411
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,716
Threw one In the channel
In the 10th.

412
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,194
-I guess they're even now.
-Yep.

413
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,514
And they're even In thIs match.
Both have--

414
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,471
All done with lunch?

415
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,954
You hardly touched this.

416
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,512
I'm not hungry.

417
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:02,312
Well....

418
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,588
I'm leaving the rice pudding.

419
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,478
I'm not hungry, Marie.

420
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,397
So don't eat It.

421
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:15,278
Speaking of babies, he has a new one,
Joseph, and a son, Anthony.

422
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,911
Hey, Marie. How you doing?

423
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:37,518
-l'm okay. Is there a problem?
-No, no.

424
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,318
Everythlng's flne.

425
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,953
I'm here for Hank, actually.

426
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,675
Oh, you're so sweet.
Hank'll be thrilled.

427
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,953
Hard and straIght.

428
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,196
-And makes It the wrong way.
-Sweetle.

429
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,355
You have a visitor.

430
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,996
Oh, Jesus.

431
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,349
What now? She rob a bank?

432
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,039
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

433
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,830
Oh, well....

434
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,952
Can't complaln.
You know, every day a little better.

435
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,754
-That's good. You're looking good.
-Yeah, well...

436
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,870
...handsome was never the hard part.

437
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:20,274
Come on in, grab a seat.

438
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,909
Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.

439
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,472
Llsten...

440
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,871
...thanks again for the other day.
You know, this whole thing, it's....

441
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,838
It's been hard on her.

442
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,758
Forget it. Glad to help.

443
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,799
So rock collectlng?

444
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,948
They're minerals, but, yeah.

445
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,431
It's catalogulng.
You know, sort them, label them.

446
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,710
-lt's actually a lot of work.
-Yeah.

447
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,433
No, It looks like It.

448
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,434
-So, what's up?
-Well....

449
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,153
Actually,
I could use your help on something.

450
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,590
Homicide. Possibly drug-related.

451
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,995
You want my help on a case?

452
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,788
What am I, Ironside?

453
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:11,559
No, you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent.

454
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,229
And a pal ljust did a favour for,
so let me pick your brain a sec.

455
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,989
You ever come across a guy
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

456
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:20,708


457
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,672
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

458
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,119
-Okay.
-No signs of forced entry...

459
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,718
...no signs of robbery.

460
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,117
Okay, so it's a crime of passion.
Where's the drug angle?

461
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,354
We found a notebook at his place.

462
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,233
I made a copy for you,
In case you're Interested.

463
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:44,237
Looks like it pertains to some kind
of methamphetamine superlab.

464
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,429
Yeah.

465
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,917
It's filled with scientific formulas
and chemical purchase lists...

466
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:53,031
...drawlngs,
pages and pages of this stuff.

467
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:57,949
It looks big-time, but I'm no authority,
so I wonder if you might take a look?

468
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:02,028
Come on, Tim, seriously?

469
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,319
What Is this,
some sort of a charity thlng?

470
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,430
Your expertise could be useful here.

471
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,473
I'm lying here like third base...

472
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,114
...living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

473
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,674
I'm not even useful to myself.

474
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,798
Want my advice?

475
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,194
You take this to Steve Gomez.

476
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,357
-He'll help you out.
-I give this to Steve Gomez...

477
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,314
...and all of a sudden it becomes a
DEA case, what good does that do me?

478
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,230
If you could just take a look,
tell me what I got here.

479
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,470
I'd really appreciate it.

480
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,868
Yeah.

481
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,433
Whatever.

482
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,271
Thanks, man.

483
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:51,198
Take It easy.

484
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,631
That's what I do.

485
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,317
-No, no.
-The three, seven, nIne. He says, "No."

486
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,917
Well, it was a good try.

487
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,955
Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah.

488
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,438
Okay.

489
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,077


490
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,908
Nail salon sounded promising.
What do you think?

491
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,712
lthlnk we wait.

492
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,319
Walt?

493
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,996
Skyler, it has been five hours.

494
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,632


495
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,989
-Just wait.
-Just wait.

496
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,473
Look....

497
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,472
It was a good idea.
It was a great idea, but it didn't work.

498
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:18,115
So why don't we simply chalk It up
as a learning--

499
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:27,590
White residence.

500
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:30,111
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

501
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,832
Am I still interested?

502
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,553
Well, I think that depends.

503
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:40,469
Yes, 879 was the original offer,
but that seems high to me now.

504
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,829
-Now I'm offering 800.
-No, no, no.

505
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,392
-No, don't do that.
-Why?

506
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,875
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz.

507
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,639
You were rude,
disrespectful towards my husband.

508
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,798
Furthermore, I've met
with quite a number of sellers...

509
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:58,311
...and the market seems much softer
than I thought, so 800.

510
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,998
Well, I understand that you're
disappointed, but that is my final offer.

511
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:11,188
I'm sorry we couldn't make It work.
Goodbye.

512
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,468
What are you doing?

513
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,476
I'm negotlatlng.

514
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,158
Why?

515
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,759
Because I want to pay less.

516
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,392
Oh, no.

517
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,908
Seventy-nine thousand dollars less?

518
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,156
Who cares?
Do you know how much I make?

519
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,272
Yeah, but that's the very reason
we need to negotiate.

520
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,835
We don't wanna arouse suspicion
by not trying to get a good deal.

521
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,352
Look, I get the logic, I do,
but you just went too far with it.

522
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,834
You're calling him names?

523
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,350
I didn't call him names.
I said he was unpleasant.

524
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,194
Well, he's not calling you back.

525
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,359
I mean,
you didn't honestly think that worked?

526
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,990
Yeah, I do.

527
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,912
No way. Sorry. No.

528
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,271
So look, it's time to move on.

529
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:05,118
Okay? I'm gonna call Saul.

530
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,430
Where's my phone?

531
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:27,707
-No.
-What?

532
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,239
-No, just--
-What for?

533
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:31,953
Wait. Wait.

534
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:36,117
Oh, my God.

535
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,271


536
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,112
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

537
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,118
No one's paying attention
to where these things are.

538
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:50,631
There's gotta be thousands of them
all over the world coming right for us.

539
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,628
And put one inside an ice cream truck,
drive it into San Francisco.

540
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,718
I'm not even that scared
of burning up and cannibalism.

541
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,957
To me, the thing that worries me
is getting trampled...

542
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,469
...or shoved up
against a chaln-llnk fence.

543
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,876
If you think about it,
if you're against a chain-link fence...

544
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,311
...and you've got a lot, I mean,
a lot of people trying to escape...

545
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,829
...pushing hard enough forward...

546
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,509
...you are gonna get squeezed
right through the chain-links.

547
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,076
lee Play-Doh
or some kind of soft meat.

548
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,031
And this is inevitable, okay?

549
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,391
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

550
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,228
And if the fence posts are stuck deep,
really deep with the cement...

551
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:32,077
...way down inside the ground...

552
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:34,190
...it's definitely happening to you.

553
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,079
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, bltch.

554
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:41,351
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

555
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,636
Like soft meat, man.

556
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,197
Right through.
Squeezed through there like soft meat.

557
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,668
lee soft meat.

558
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,151
Right through the chain-links,
right through the chain-links.

559
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:01,953
Hey. Hey.

560
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,589
Moneyl

561
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,597
That one was mine.

562
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,359
-Take It easyl
-Hey, you took m|ne, manl

563
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,073
Yeahl

564
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,110
-Nlce.
-Yeah.

565
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:55,911
To clean cars and clean money.

566
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,638
Hear, hear.

567
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,635
You see?

568
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,557
I told you we'd get it.

569
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:09,317
Did you?

570
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:14,911
Seriously.

571
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,713
It was really great work.

572
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,592
It's lmpresslve.

573
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,109
Thank you.

574
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,840
And Saul finally came through.

575
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:29,350
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, rlght?

576
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,237
Well, yes, he found the guy, but
I told him what to do and what to say.

577
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:37,112
You're right. That's the hard part.

578
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,354
But, yes, Saul was finally useful.

579
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,436
Throw him a bone.

580
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,552
Oh, my God.

581
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:52,637
-Thls |s truly amazing.
-Yes, well, It better be.

582
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,910
Three hundred twenty dollars
a bottle.

583
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,234
What?

584
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:59,351
'Cuvee Pol Roger
Sir Winston Churchlll.‘

585
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,834
Apparently,
It was his favourite champagne...

586
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,155
...so they just named it after him.

587
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:07,510
-How did you pay for It?
-What do you mean?

588
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,268
No. Cash, I paid cash.

589
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:13,915
No, I'm asking how did you,
Walter Whlte...

590
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,349
...an unemployed school teacher,
pay for It?

591
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,390
-How do you explain It?
-Skyler.

592
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,073
No one saw me.

593
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,712
Whoever sold it to you did.

594
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,595
And that's not the point.
The point is we're broke, remember?

595
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:30,553
I'm waiting for your unemployment
cheque so I can pay the phone bill.

596
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:33,478
I asked for an extension
from the power company. Why?

597
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,911
-Because on paper, we have no money.
-You are completely overreacting.

598
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,032
I'm not apologising for wanting
to celebrate in some small way.

599
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,355
I'm not asking you to apologise,
Walt.

600
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,277
I'm asking you to be smart.

601
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:49,118
I bought one bottle of champagne.

602
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,312
One single bottle, Skyler.

603
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:54,589
I paid cash. That's It.

604
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,519
That's all it takes, okay?
I mean, look at Watergate.

605
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,516
One piece of duct tape on a door...

606
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,392
...brought down
the president of the United States.

607
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,271
-What? I'm leon now?
-No.

608
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:07,152
What I'm saying Is
the devil Is In the details.

609
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,591
One little mlstake,
one sllpup In our story...

610
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:12,835
...that could ruin us.

611
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,319
Flne.

612
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,189
Gotta destroy the evidence.

613
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:39,510
And when I look at this image
that is part of the record...

614
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,429
...I am very concerned about
what sort of distraction that could be...

615
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,835
...whether It's from
any sort of sIgnage...

616
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,350
...but especially signage that's
changing every five seconds.

617
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,039
Thank you.

618
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,836
Any other questions?

619
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,675
We have a motion and a second
on the floor to grant the appeal.

620
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,350
All those In favour, ralse your hand
and say yes. Yes.

621
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:04,232
There's four In the afl'lrmatlve.
Those opposed?

622
00:43:04,439 --> 00:43:08,637
There's flve no's and the--
That motlon falls.

623
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,876
I would like to make a motion
to uphold the decision...

624
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,189
And the motion, then, is seconded
by Councillor Cook. Any questions?

625
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,554
Isee none. All those in favour, signify
by saying ”yes" to deny the appeal.

626
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,635
All those In favour,
slgnlfy by saylng "yes. "

627
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,912
There's five in the affirmative
All those opposed, say ”no."

628
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,709
There's four In the negatlve.
Now, that passes.
