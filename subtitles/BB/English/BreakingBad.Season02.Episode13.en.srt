00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,269
Sit tight. I know who to call.

19
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,634
Saul Goodman sent me.

20
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,513
Come on. Inlldo.

21
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,357
Watch the door.

00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,991
Where I: the?

23
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,155
Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,755
Thlnk hard.
Your freedom depend: on It.

25
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,631
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,553
Here's your story.

27
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,149
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,158
Say It.

29
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,518
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,273
Say It. 'I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.‘

31
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,276
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:45,754
Agaln.

33
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,476
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,193
Agaln. Agaln.

35
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,233
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,671
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,678
Once you call,
the people who show up...

38
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:06,347
...will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,835
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,235
Police officer: may arrive,
they may not.

41
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,431
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,028
Typically, 0D: are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,397
There's nothing to incriminate you...

44
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,830
...ao I'd be amazed
If you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:26,230
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,476
You tell them
you Just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,796
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,274
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,228
l was not here.

50
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,593
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

51
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,630
...and cover
those track mark: on your arm.

52
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,670
Count down from 20,
and then you dlal.

53
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,836
Hang tough.
You're In the home stretch.

54
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,394
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:45,308
-Two.
-Two. All right.

56
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,518
Thank you.

57
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,758
Junlor.

58
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,672
Junlor.

59
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,549
-Flynn.
-What?

60
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,079
Flynn.

61
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,878
Flynn.

62
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,475
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,038
You all right?

64
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,077
Flynn, get your butt in here.

65
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,951
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,070
Seriously.

67
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,156
-What?
-Look right there. Look at that.

68
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,635
Are those donations?

69
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,431
-Yes.
-Actual donations for your dad?

70
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,911
Total strangers gave us $490.

71
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,750
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

72
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,269
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

73
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,712
And it's all real, actual money.

74
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,875
It's actually right there
In the PayPal account.

75
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,792
And look what they're saying.

76
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,118
'Hang In there, Walt.‘ 'Good luck.'
'Hang In there.‘

77
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,116
Isn't this awesome?

78
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:27,351
That's-- Wow, that is something.

79
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,839
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you Is In order?

80
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,957
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,231
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

82
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,513
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

83
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:50,509
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

84
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,677
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

85
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,835
"Do-not-call llst. "

86
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,712
However, If you're cool,
leave It at the beep.

87
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,434
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

88
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,596
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

89
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,157
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

90
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,550
Slr, you may not wanna
be here for this.

91
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,476
| just woke up and I found her.

92
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,432
That's all I know.

93
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,837
What's her date of birth?

94
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,270
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

95
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,599

98
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,598
-My mother?
-Your daughter's mother.

99
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,312


100
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:00,116
-And place of birth?
-Phoenlx.

101
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,953
Phoenix, Arizona?

102
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,634
This is our address.

103
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,997
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

104
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,553
I can drive.

105
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,637
Well, then If you'd like
to meet us there...

106
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,148
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

107
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,554
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

108
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,034
Okay?

109
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,630
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

110
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,070
I don't believe It.
Walt, you have to see this.

111
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,190
-Forty from Te--
-Terre Haute.

112
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,354
Walt.

113
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,395
It's me.

114
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,635
Are you there? Hello.

115
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,916
I'm Just checking In.

116
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,268
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

117
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,709
That's-- That's good.

118
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,912
So listen. Just call me, all right?

119
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,875
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

120
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,553
All right. I'm coming.

121
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,798
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

122
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,833
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

123
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,112
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

124
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,312
Biggest donation...

125
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,238
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

126
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,836
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

127
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,792
Smallest donatlon
gets two slx-packs.

128
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,992
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

129
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,189
...here's what we know.

130
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,674
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

131
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,347
Shot dead
by an unknown assallant last month.

132
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,118
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,110
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,833
No. He was a dlpshlt
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,473
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

136
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,148
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,148
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

138
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,117
So why am I talking about him?

139
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,599
Anyone? Anyone?

140
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,754
Bueller?

141
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,077
-He was dealing Blue Sky.
-That's right.

142
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,952
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

143
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,596
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

144
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,198
But wait. It gets better.

145
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,391
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

146
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,555
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

147
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,558
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:53,911
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

149
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,075
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

150
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,588
I know you don't buy It,
but maybe It's true.

151
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,271
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

152
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,391
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

153
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,114
-He copped to it, didn't he?
-For an extra pudding cup...

154
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,593
...every night at Los Lunas?

155
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,790
Maybe If you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

156
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,116
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

157
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,548
I've been thinking.

158
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:23,071
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

159
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,111
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

160
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,879
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

161
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,310
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

162
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,548
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

163
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,193
But outslde,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

164
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,277
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

165
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,439
In fact, everywhere but here.

166
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,351
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

167
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,799


168
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,074
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

169
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,109
I say he's gone regional.

170
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,435
Only he's still right here in town.

171
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,193
Come on, 2800.

172
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,550
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

173
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,273
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

174
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,953
Fo-- Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

175
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,558
-Yesl
-Yesl

176
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,154
Who's gonna be next?

177
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,078
Your guy found him?

178
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,231
Where Is he?

179
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,395
Okay, llsten.

180
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,033
No, no, I don't care.

181
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,797
You have your guy pick--

182
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:30,910
Saul. Just shut-- Saul.

183
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,270
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

184
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,873
I don't recommend it.

185
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,077
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

186
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,839
..keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

187
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,838
Are they here now?

188
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,749
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

189
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:53,915
Police could be the least of it.

190
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,996
You could just get mugged or shot.

191
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,158
How about you go on home, Walter?

192
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,271
Let me handle this.

193
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,232
Yo.

194
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,677
Jesse.

195
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,508
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

196
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:40,517
-Wake up. Wake up.
-Hey.

197
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,235
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

198
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:46,350
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just--

199
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,677
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

200
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:50,948
Jesse.

201
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,720
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,390


203
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,917
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

204
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,156
Llsten, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

205
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,430
You are not good at all. You hear?

206
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,157
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

207
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,679
You're gonna stand up...

208
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:16,234
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

209
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,395
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

210
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,717
That's It. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

211
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,431
I killed her.

212
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:53,551
-What?
-I killed her. It was me.

213
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,317
-I killed her, man. I killed her.
-No.

214
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,511
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

215
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,073
You didn't kill anybody.

216
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:03,594
I loved her.

217
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,674
I loved her more than anything.

218
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:23,236


219
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,270
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

220
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,596
I guess they should be....

221
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:19,155
I don't know.
Just use your best judgement.

222
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,635
There's no yellow dress here.

223
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,309
It's all-- It's all black and grey.

224
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,799
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

225
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,475
What about blue?

226
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,830
Blue's better than black, right?

227
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,512
No, no. Not dark blue. More like....

228
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,554
Not super-bright, either.

229
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,351
I mean, blue is blue.

230
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,995
No. No cleavage.

231
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,151
Long sleeves.

232
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,433
Yeah. It's nice.

233
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,552
It's nice.

234
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:08,751
Blg yawn, Holly.

235
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,838
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

236
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,712
-Okay, sweetle.
-Yes.

237
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,479
Yesl

238
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,035
Here we go.

239
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:26,709
Here we go. Yes.

240
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,750
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

241
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,510
Junlor. Hey.

242
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,272
The dlnglng.
Just turn down the volume.

243
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,917
-Dad, It's money.
-Just please do It.

244
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,508
Okay, the noise
ls disturbing the baby.

245
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,111
Marie, slow down. I can't--

246
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,078
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

247
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,632
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

248
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,468
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna-- Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

249
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:07,998
Okay.

250
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,197
-Guess what.
-What?

251
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,789
-You are gonna be In the newspaper.
-No way.

252
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:15,910
One of Marie's patlents
works at the Journal.

253
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,314
She told him about the website
and the donations...

254
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,749
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

255
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:21,914
-For real?
-Yep.

256
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,997
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

257
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:26,712
Awesome.

258
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,311
-lt'll mean more hits.
-And more contrlbutlons.

259
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,750
East of Scottsdale?

260
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,269
Let me guess. Not talking.

261
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,837
Nope. Not a one.

262
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,838
Someone somewhere
ls running one tlght shlp.

263
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,389
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

264
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,272
Yeah. You too.

265
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:57,717
Agent Schrader,

266
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,989
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

267
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,592
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

268
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,708

270
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,791
Paul Canterna

-Please, just Gus.
-Hl, Gus.

273
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,438
You guys make some killer chicken.

274
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,155
Thank you very much.

275
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,749
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

276
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,711
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

277
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,388
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

278
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,591
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

279
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,232
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

280
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,954
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

281
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,799
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

282
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,636
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

283
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,717
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

284
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,149
-Terrlble.
-Yeah. It Is lndeed.

285
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,873
We've had
some successes locally...

286
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,071
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

287
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,715
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

288
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,989
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

289
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,348
Anything we can do.

290
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,913
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Hank.

291
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,188
-Gentlemen.
-Thanks.

292
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,991
Sure. Thank you.

293
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,558
Is this one of your agents?

294
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,548
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-ln-law.

295
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,636
He's got a health lssue.
We're trying to--

296
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,116
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health Issue?

297
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,748
-Lung cancer.
-Oh, that's a rough one.

298
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,474
-Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
-PIease. Please. I'm happy to do it.

299
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,118
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

300
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:54,515
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

301
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,153
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

302
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,948
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

303
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,752
But If not,
Saul will take care of things.

304
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,032
He's got your money.
He's keeplng It for you.

305
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:26,033
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

306
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:30,278
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

307
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,195
I deserve this.

308
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,558
What?

309
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,232
What you said in the desert.

310
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:43,988
I get it, what you meant.

311
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,314
I deserve whatever happens.

312
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:11,790
0h, shlt.

313
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:28,271
There he Isl

314
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:31,991
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

315
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,475
We called you about 50 times.

316
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,911
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

317
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:41,395
I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...

318
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,990
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

319
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,548
-Thls ls hlm?
-Yes.

320
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,078
This is Dad. Great.

321
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,396
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

322
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,431
...Mom and Dad on either side.

323
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:55,992
Mom and Dad?

324
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,633
How much money
have you raised so far?

325
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,709
Slx thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

326
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,875
But there's more coming In
all the time.

327
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,799
-Wow, that's amazing.
-We don't even know what to say.

328
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:13,309
It's just-- It's been incredible.

329
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,635
Judging from things you have
written about him...

330
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,312
-...your dad must be quite a guy.
-Yeah. He is. He's the best.

331
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,874
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

332
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,073
None of us do. We love him.

333
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,831
-He's a good man, Isn't he?
-Absolutely. Ask anyone.

334
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,751
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

335
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,428
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

336
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,753
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

337
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:48,237
He's just decent.

338
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,750
And he always does the right thing.

339
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,270
And that's how he teaches me to be.

340
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,076
-Would you say he's your hero?
-Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

341
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:02,793
My dad is my hero.

342
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:12,437
Does that put him to sleep?

343
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,992
This one just relaxes him a little.

344
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,839
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

345
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,597
Okay. Thank you.

346
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,554
Well....

347
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,476
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

348
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,677
Relaxed yet?

349
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:52,915
As a matter of fact....

350
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,310
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

351
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,638
Yeah, It looks like It.

352
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,351
We'll be here when you wake up.

353
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,840
Well, I'll be looking for you.

354
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,599
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

355
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,437
Yeah, you better.

356
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,788
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

357
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,197
Where's your phone?

358
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,516
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

359
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,358
Which one?

360
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,714
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring It, Mom.

361
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,519
Okay.

362
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,999
Well, first things first.

363
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:59,429
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

364
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:02,472
Iwas actually thinking
of bringing her today, but....

365
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:04,795
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

366
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,955
-Seven, right?
-Yeah.

367
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,471
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

368
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,431
...here somewhere.

369
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,115
-She's beautlful.
-Thanks.

370
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:18,913
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean It.

371
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,716
-How's your pain level, Walter?
-lt's....

372
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,831
Very low, baslcally.

373
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,837
Shortness of breath?

374
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,678
-A bit, but much better.
-Good.

375
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,472
Well, your margins look good.

376
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,112
I can't foresee the future...

377
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:37,037
...but even
conservatively speaklng...

378
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,753
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

379
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,189
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

380
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,117
That's great.

381
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,757
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

382
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,355
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

383
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,789
-He can ease Into It now.
-Okay.

384
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,199
-And can he go back to work or...?
-I'd give it a few more weeks.

385
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:05,394
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

386
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,068
But he can be on his own?

387
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:11,396
I mean, just more,
you know, Independent.

388
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,274
Yes. Use your best judgement.

389
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,308
Well....

390
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,987
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

391
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,394
One Iess baby in the house.

392
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,390
-Don, hey.
-Hey, Stew.

393
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,955
Hey, welcome back.

394
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,037
Thanks. It's good to be back.

395
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,358
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

396
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,190
Yes. Thanks.

397
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,510
Terrlble thlng. Just....

398
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,276
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and....

399
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:57,039
-You been doing okay?
-l'm doing okay.

400
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:00,795
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

401
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:04,389
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

402
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,708
-Focus on work.
-Sure. Absolutely.

403
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,594
Yeah.

404
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,469
Well, see you lnslde.

405
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:18,269
Continue to descend through 1500.

406
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,357
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

407
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,154
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

408
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,955
Truth or Consequences altimeter,

409
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,836

410
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:37,395
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

411
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,033
Jullet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Wlnslow.

412
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,707
I think I mayjust keep this.

413
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:45,948
Sky?

414
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,992
What do you think?

415
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,716
Doesn't look so bad, right?

416
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,069
What are you doing?

417
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,714
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

418
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,636
-S|nce when?
-l'm taking the baby with me.

419
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,670
Marle will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

420
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,153
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

421
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,194
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

422
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,313
Why would I do that?

423
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,557
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

424
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,115
-Skyler.
-I want you gone by Monday morning.

425
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:20,672
I want--

426
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,229
I want you gone.

427
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:35,393
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

428
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,590
Because you're a liar, Walt.

429
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:42,271
Two cell phones, after all.

430
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,634
What?

431
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,672
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

432
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,589
...and you said, "Which one?"

433
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,949
When?

434
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,594
Skyler, I was medicated.

435
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:58,869
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

436
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,035
You know what I think?

437
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,917
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

438
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,874
Honey, we have been over this.

439
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,957
Asked and answered, right?

440
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,958
Then it got me thinking again...

441
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,596
...about all the strange behaviour.

442
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,155
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

443
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,715
Out of my mind with worry,
calllng hospltals...

444
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,751
...checking the morgue.

445
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,630
Your fugue state?

446
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,588
I had to believe that, didn't I?

447
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,434
I had to find a way.

448
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,069
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

449
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,988
You tell me, Skyler.

450
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,157
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

451
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,393
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

452
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,716
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

453
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,480
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

454
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,954
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

455
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,314
Something was going on between you.
ljust knew.

456
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:03,909
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

457
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,838
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

458
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,952
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

459
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,795
It really took me forever
to get In touch with her.

460
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,830
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

461
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:19,112
So I finally left a message:

462
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,995
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

463
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,508
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

464
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,156
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

465
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,875
The money for your treatment...

466
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,874
...Gretchen and Elllott
didn't give you a dime.

467
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,151
They paid for nothing.

468
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,669
You refused every offer
they made you.

469
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,108
But that didn't make sense...

470
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,675
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

471
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,031
...and not including your surgery...

472
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,151
...we're nearly paid up.

473
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:56,073
Over $100,000.

474
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:01,677
Out of where? Out of thin air?

475
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,472
But then...

476
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,996
...I called your mother.

477
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:18,478
Yeah.

478
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:21,231
Thanks for that too.

479
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,110
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

480
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,232
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

481
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,357
It's possible.

482
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:37,717
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

483
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,755
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

484
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,075
You never went to see her.

485
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,670
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

486
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,233
You were gone for four days...

487
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:57,068
...and yet she swears...

488
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,794
...that you were never there.

489
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,512
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

490
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,315
Skyler.

491
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,078
Could you...

492
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:16,876
...just once...

493
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,189
...do me the courtesy
of not denylng It?

494
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,513
Skyler.

495
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,712
Skyler, don't do this, please.

496
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,070


497
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,074
Skyler, please don't go.

498
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,076
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

499
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,799
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

500
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,832
Whatever It Is...

501
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,797
