lwlll own hlm when thls ls over.

75
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,600
Every cent he earns...

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,116
...every cent hls wll'e earns...

77
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,554


78
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,876
Anyplace he goes...

79
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,996
...anywhere he turns...

80
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,116
...l'm gonna be there...

81
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,793
...grabblng my share.

82
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,716
He'll be scrubblng tollets ln TIJuana
l'or pennles...

83
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,074
...and I'll be standlng over hlm...

84
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,389
...to get my cut.

85
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:15,830


86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,710
...and when he crawls to sleep
In whatever rat hole ls left for hlm...

87
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,269
...after I shred hls house down.

88
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:28,987
lwlll haunt hls crusty ass...

89
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,832

...untll the day...

91
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,431
...he stlcks a gun up hls mouth...

92
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,636
...and pulls the trlgger...

93
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,836
...Just to get me out of hls head.

94
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:48,477
That's what happens next.

95
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,870
My advlce:

96
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,192
That's probably
not a good strategy.

97
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:05,147
They're scared of you rlght now.
They want nothlng to do wlth you.

98
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:07,071
But It you hlt them...

99
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,878
...they're forced to hlt back hard.

100
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,794
I mean, they wlll turn over every rock
hlther, thlther and yon...

101
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,554
...untll someone spllls the beans on you

...present company Included.

103
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,311
Yes, lthlnk what Saul ls saylng
makes a lot of sense.

104
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,793
Jesse, move on wlth your llI'e.

105
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,392
Leave It behlnd, all of It.

106
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,709
Nothlng changes...

107
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,235
...once I walk out of here.

108
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,117
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooklng agaln.

109
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:42,516

110
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,955
...you're golng to get away wlth that?
They wlll catch you.

111
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,916
-So what?
-What?

113
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,870
Hey, I may have overstated
the power of your face.

114
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,429
Not thls.

115
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,716
II' the cops catch me...

116
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,798
...l glve them

117
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,553

118
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,316
They nab me...

119
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,635

00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,270
...to glve up the great Helsenberg...

121
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,513
...and hls mllllon-dollar drug rlng.

122
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,719
You're my free pass...

123
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,510
...bltch.

124
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,388
You're so sure.

125
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,154
Look, II' he dldn't glve up my name
whlle Hank was beatlng hlm...

126
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,832
...he's never golng to talk.

127
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,235
What do you thlnk that was, a bluff?

128
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,756
He wants your brother-ln-law.
And there's gonna be lawyers...

129
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,115
...creamlng thelr Underoos
for a case llke that.

130
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,670
I'd take It myself If It wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

131
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,319
And hlm cooklng agaln?

132
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,473
Hey, when, not If, he gets caught,
and he's faclng 20 years...

133
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,917
...what'll he do then? Belleve me,
there's no honour among thleves.

134
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,037
Except for us, of course.

135
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,432


136
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,556
He'll come around.

137
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,068
And If he doesn't...

138
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,628
...there may come a tlme
to talk optlons.

139
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,314
Optlons?

140
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,037
I'm convlnced
Mr. Plnkman was Involved...

141
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,397
...In the manufacture and dlstrlbutlon
of phenyl-2 methamphetamlne...

142
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,629
...speclflcally what we call
the blue meth.

143
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,631
l tracked hlm to a scrap yard...

144
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,188
...where he stored
an early-'80s camper...

145
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,828
Whlle waltlng for a warrant
to search thls vehlcle...

146
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,753
...whlch l belleve to be
a rolllng meth lab...

147
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,275
...l recelved a telephone call...

148
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,350
...telllng me my wlfe Marle
had been Injured In an accldent.

149
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,753
Upon hearlng the news...

150
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,993
...I left Mr. Plnkman
and hls vehlcle to tend to my wlfe.

151
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,155
Arrlvlng at the hospltal, I learned
the emergency call was a hoax.

152
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:20,595
My wlfe, fortunately, was unharmed.

153
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:27,312
So I lmmedlately went back to
the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.

154
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,675
Most llkely destroyed on slte.

155
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,957
And It was at thls polnt you drove
to the home of Jesse Plnkman?

156
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,748
Agent Schrader needs to get home...

157
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,909
...get some rest.

158
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,709
That's flne. But Just to conflrm,
you're taklng the Flfth here?

159
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,312
Yeah, that's correct.

160
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,232
Okay. Well...

161
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,789
...we Just wanna glve you all
a heads up.

162
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:04,515
Mr. Plnkman ls presslng charges
In thls matter.

163
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,718
He's glven a detalled verslon
of events as he sees them.

164
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,154
The word of a meth head.

165
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:11,911
We know all about hls hlstory.

166
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,436
We're well aware,
but toxlcology on Plnkman....

167
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,835
Hls blood ls clean, he's not uslng.

168
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,991
The kld ls even refuslng hls
doctor-ordered paln meds...

169
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,832
...far as we can tell.

170
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,038


171
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,512
...where do we go from here?

172
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,194
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR wlll come down...

173
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,156
...probably tomorrow mornlng.

It's all gonna work out.

184
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,068
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

185
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,394
I hope It goes wlthout saylng we're not

186

00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,234
I guess crlme does pay.

193
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,590
I don't suppose you Just came by

194
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,272

You know what's gonna happen to hlm
If thls Plnkman presses charges?

207
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,228
Hank could lose everythlng.

208
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,070
I thought maybe...

209
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,234
...there's a way you could help hlm.

210
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,237

But there must be somethlng

00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,434
Isn't It even worth a try?

219
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,509

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,749

00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,796

IJust thought....

231
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,867
A blt more professlonal.

232
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,358
Well, everythlng Is on track.

233
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,835
We got our dlstlllate.
Just waltlng to--

234
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,877
Let's get our trays ready.

235

236

237
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:03,798

238
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,951
I thought you mlght ask that.

239
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,108


240
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,118
That's good.

241
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,509
That's good.

242
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,797
Hand In glove,
that's what we strlve for.

243
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,831
You know, thls mlght be the beglnnlng

244
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,437
So you the gentlemen?

245
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:01,474
Lucky you boys caught me,
I got a load to plck up In Memphls.

246
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:05,791
I can hammer It out In about 15,
but there's thls glrl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.

247
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,189
She's got thls fetlsh,
she llkes to get peed on.

248
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,556

but she wants to sleep before 10...

249
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:16,031
...so I wanna wrap It up here ASAP
because trafflc can be a wlld card.

250
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:20,997
Thlng ls, women who llke to get peed on
tend to be from the warmer cllmates.

251
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,037
You'd thlnk the ones In colder zones
would be more lncllned.

252
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,509
Maybe It's a shock
If the body's not accllmated...

253
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,877
...but, you know, I leave that
for smarter mlnds than me.

254
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,112
Sclence Is a mystery.

255
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,119
Well, take a gander.
Prlces are negotlable.

256
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,193

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,147


286
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:03,437
It's always been 85.

287
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,836

00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:58,834
...and you had to dlsarm hlm.

311
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,672
Muscle memory.

312
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,754
Happens all the tlme. Years of tralnlng,
your body acted faster than your braln.

313
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,592
You had no cholce but to hlt hlm.

00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,751
-You had to flght back.
-Marle, Marle, Marle.

00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,272


316
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,271
I'm not gonna go In there and lle.

317
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,718
It's some lowllfe degenerate

318
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,154
...dolng the Job you're supposed to.

319
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,870

...for dolng the rlght thlng?

321
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:32,553
Oh, baby, It wasn't the rlght thlng.

322
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,754
It's not what the Job Is.

323
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,994
I'm supposed to be better than that.

324
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:43,076
And you made one mlstake.

325
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,272
No, It wasn't one mlstake. I've been--

326
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,476

327
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:56,994
...unravelllng, you know?

328
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,033

00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:13,349
My chest gets all tlght.
I can't breathe.

332
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:15,994

333
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,671

I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

336
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,348
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
between the eyes....

337
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,035
It changed me.

338
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,919
And I can't seem to control It.

339
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,391
l trled to flght It.

340
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,431
But then...

341
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,311
...El Paso.

342
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,949
And It's Just gotten worse.

343
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,396
What I dld to Plnkman...

344
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,309
...that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

345
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,117
