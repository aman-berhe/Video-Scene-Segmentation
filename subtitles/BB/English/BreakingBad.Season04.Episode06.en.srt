1
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,152


2
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,478
Hay.

3
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,477
It's me.

4
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,752
I wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids.

5
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,798
I love you.

6
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,116
It's me.

7
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,234
[just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and--

8
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,990
-Morn|ng.
-Mtarnoon.

9
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,350
Oh, really? Jesus.

10
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,347
You shouldn't have let me sleep.

11
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,436
You needed It.

12
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,437
Skyler, I don't entirely remember
what happened last night.

13
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,517
I mean, I mlght have nld
some thlnge that--

14
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,393
Dld you know
thls Gale Boettlcher person?

15
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,794
-8kyler, I can't even focus on--
-Gale Boettlcher.

16
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,272
Did you know him?

17
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,712
My God. What--?

18
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,753
What exactly did I say last night?

19
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,790
Just enough.

20
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,909
Did you work together?

21
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,712
Who killed him?

22
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,114
Was it the people you work for?

23
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,195
Deflnltely not.

24
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,719
Was it somebody who...

25
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,910
...at some polnt,
mlght wanna do the same to you?

26
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,999
I seriously doubt it. No.

27
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,272


28
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,355
Oh, God.

29
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,709
I think I know what happened
last night, Walt.

30
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,594
I know exactly what happened
last night. I drank too much wine.

31
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,996
You told Hank...

32
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,636
...that the man he was looking for
might still be out there.

33
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,277
That It mlght not be thls Boettlcher
after all.

34
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,031
And I was up all night, wondering
why you would say that to him.

35
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,673
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

36
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,872
No, but then I was remembering
your black eye.

37
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,755
Your business disagreement
that you don't wanna talk about.

38
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,872
Look, I don't want to talk
about any of thls. Ever.

39
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,354
The firewall, all right?

40
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,391
Church and state.

41
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,238
That's how we need to approach
thls thlng.

42
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,516
And then I remembered the message
you left me the other day...

43
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,908
...when you said you loved me.

44
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,712
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe you--

45
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,117
I don't know, that you were regretting
what's happened between us.

46
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,513
And I get that.

47
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,195
After last nlght, l....

48
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,313
Walt, I think you're scared.

49
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,069
I think that message
was some kind of goodbye.

50
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,918
No, Skyler.

51
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,157
-l thlnk last nlght was a cry for help.
-0h, Jesus.

52
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:20,678
A cry for help?

53
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,552
lthlnk some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

54
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,075
That Is Just....

55
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:33,148
That Is It exactly. Yes.

56
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,396
You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

57
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,588


58
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,471
At least this would all be over.

59
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,912
Yeah, yeah, oh, there's a tremendous
weight just lifted off of me.

60
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,156
Now I understand myself.

61
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,873
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,640
Walt, I've said it before.

63
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,991
If you are In danger,
we go to the pollce.

64
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,353
-I don't wanna hear about the police.
-I do not say that lightly.

65
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,551
I know what It could do
to thls famlly.

66
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,833
But if it's the only real choice we have,
if it's either that or you getting shot--

67
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,916
I don't wanna hear about the police.

68
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,159
You're not some hardened criminal,
Walt. You are in over your head.

69
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,509
That's what we'll tell them, the truth.

70
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,188
-That Is not the truth.
-Of course It Is.

71
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,551
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money....

72
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,796
-We're done here.
-Roped into working-- Unable to quit.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,956
You told me that yourself, Walt.

74
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,869
Jesus, what was I thlnklng?
Walt, please.

75
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,674
Let's both of us stop trying
to justify this whole thing...

76
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,472
...and admit you're in danger.

77
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,348
Who are you talking to right now?

78
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,072
Who is it you think you see?

79
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,353
Do you know
how much I make a year?

80
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,233
I mean, even If I told you,
you wouldn't belleve It.

81
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,796
You know what would happen
if I decided to stop going in to work?

82
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,118
A business big enough that it could be
listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.

83
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,835
Dlsappears. It ceases to exlst
wlthout me. No.

84
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,918
You clearly don't know who you're
talking to, so let me clue you in.

85
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:11,907
I am not In danger, Skyler.
I am the danger.

86
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:16,032
A guy opens his door and gets shot,
and you think that of me? No.

87
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,118
I am the one who knocks.

88
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,910
Look, lwas....

89
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,917
Skyler?

90
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,836
Here we are. Just like you left it.

91
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,355
And where is your pretty wife?

92
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,951
She has other business to attend to.

93
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:54,394
Well, llke I say to her,
place sells as Is. Understand?

94
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,030
Yes, I understand.

95
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,151


96
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,793
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

97
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,434
She gave me hard time
when we settled on price.

98
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,757
We're all on the same page, Bogdan.

99
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,840
So here is everything you need.

100
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,759
-I keep very good f|les.
-Thank you.

101
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,279
So you are the boss now, huh?

102
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,636
You think you're ready?

103
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,879
Yes, lthlnk so.

104
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,871
Being boss is tough.

105
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,231
I know you think I was hard on you,
but you'll learn.

106
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,159
Being in charge is not easy.

107
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,159
It takes hard work.

108
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:46,556
-You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
-Yeah?

109
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,716
I don't know.

110
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,750
Not so much, maybe.

111
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,348
But maybe when you are the boss...

112
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,348
...you wlll Just keep your feet up
and relax.

113
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,512
The real important thing--

114
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,198
And not everyone knows this.

115
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,993
--Is to be tough.

116
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,148
Boss has to be tough.

117
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,194
Has to say no to people.

118
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:21,469
Has to make cashlers
wlpe down cars...

119
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,229
...even if they don't want to.

120
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,156
Can you be tough, Walter?

121
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,918
I am sure you can handle.

122
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:40,954
And If not,
you can always call your wlfe, no?

123
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,912
-Always stlcky.
-Yeah.

124
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,632
No problem.

125
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,637
As Is.

126
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,834
Who'd have thought that someday
I would be handing these keys to you?

127
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,036
Many years. Almost forgot.

128
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,712


129
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,473
As Is.

130
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,672
Thank you.

131
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,995
You okay there?

132
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,877
I'm flne.

133
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,793
Just not uslng |s....

134
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,637
Eat somethlng.

135
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,838
Yeah?

136
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,309
That's right, both of them.

137
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,639
All rlght.

138
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,590
I'm on my way.

139
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,311
You need any help?

140
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,313


141
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,395
You want me to call her back?

142
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,480


143
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,319
What exactly dld she say?
I mean, exactly.

144
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,229
Just, you know, she asked if I was okay
and not to worry.

145
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,998
lee that.

146
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,793
Any rough timetable on this thing,
as to when she's coming home?

147
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,033
It's about the gambling, right?

148
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,473
Well, it's kind of hard to--

149
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,635
Dad, she can't understand.

150
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,196
It's not like you're doing this
on purpose. You can't help it.

151
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,110
It's not that slmple.

152
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,313
Look, you have a disease.
It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

153
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,909
-No, It's not. Not at all.
-Yes, It ls. I read onllne.

154
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,713
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you.

155
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,513
She can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

156
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,029
Son, these are two
very dlfferent thlngs.

157
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:08,436
Not really.
Gambllng addlctlon Is a slckness.

158
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,153
-You can't--
-L|sten, what |s golng on wlth me...

159
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,874
...Is not about some dlsease.
It's about cholces.

160
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,512
Choices that I have made.

161
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,271
Cholces I stand by.

162
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,713
You're not moving back in, are you?

163
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,639


164
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,110
Hey, you know what?
School can walt.

165
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,597
Why don't we take a little detour?

166
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,754
What kind of detour?

167
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,511
You'll see.

168
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,797
CharIIe, pick up fine three.
LIne three, CharIIe.

169
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,674
I think it's time we got you
your own car. What do you think?

170
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,352
What?

171
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,592
I think if you're gonna buy me off...

172
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:25,314
...buy me off.

173
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,351
Get an attendant over to the lot.

174
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,189
-Amazlng. It's amazlng.
-Yeah. It's good-looklng.

175
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:56,072
That's good. I'm glad you like it.

176
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,750
-I do. Thank you, Dad.
-All rlght. You're welcome.

177
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,954
So you're here.

178
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,517
Yeah.

179
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,629
You're actually here? To work?

180
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,632
Yeah, man. Jesus.

181
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,158
Jesse.

182
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,793
Come here.

183
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,832
-All rlght, I need an update.
-Update on what?

184
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,237
An update on these little field trips
that you've been taking with Mike.

185
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:44,990
I told you already. We pick up money.
Check on things. Stuff like that.

186
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,709
And you're his bodyguard, right?
What? That's what you said.

187
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,716
I said I guarded him.

188
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,470
Like backup, like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?

189
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,629
And this has to be you?

190
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,198
It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any
of the couple dozen muscle-heads...

191
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:09,233
...that Gus has working for him?
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

192
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,319
Why? What, is there something
about you that I don't know?

193
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,714
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

194
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,149
Your hands reglstered
as lethal weapons?

195
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,349
Reglster thls.

196
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,870
All I'm saying is that
do you not even question this?

197
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,231
Do you really believe that you mean
anything to these people?

198
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,352
Not trying to insult. Just trying to
make you see things.

199
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,235
I see they can't outright kill me,
but they don't want me getting high.

200
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,592
I see this thing probably started
as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.

201
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,638
But you know what?

202
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,470
I saved Mike from getting robbed,
even killed, maybe.

203
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,274
So maybe I'm not such a loser
after all.

204
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,836
I mean, what if it--? Oh, God.

205
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,515
-All rlght. What If It's all Just a setup?
-What?

206
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:09,758
What if this robbery that you stopped
wasn't even real?

207
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,032
I mean, think about it.
Your first day out guarding Mike.

208
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:15,514
He steps out for one second
and what happens?

209
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,632
-You immediately get robbed.
-You are such an asshole.

210
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,149
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer. Like you said...

211
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,830
...Gus can't kill you because of me,
he knows I won't stand for it.

212
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,951
He hates the fact that he needs me.

213
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,674
What does he do? He goes to work
driving a wedge between you and me.

214
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:34,439
If you'd been there,
you'd know It wasn't a setup.

215
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,996
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you, huh?

216
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:41,874
Because the way you describe it,
they gave up pretty damn easy.

217
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,399
No, no, this whole thing, all of this...

218
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,190
...lt's all about me.

219
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,793
Hello?

220
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,108
Look, Just hang on.

221
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:47,913
Yeah?

222
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,199
I'll be rlght up.

223
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,278
-What?
-I gotta go.

224
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,995
What? Am I supposed to clean all this
on my own?

225
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,112
Hey.

226
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,312


227
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,112
Buenos dias, ladies, buenos dias.

228
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,799
Do you speak English?

229
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:34,388
-No.
-No, okay.

230
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,116


231
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,509
I need help to clean. Yes.

232
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,072
-Yes, muy bueno. It's Just thls--
-No.

233
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,636


234
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,873
Let me see, let me see. I tell you what.
I tell you what. Look, look.

235
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,718
Universal language.

00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,596
This one for you. Yeah, si.

237
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,156
SI, Presidente Grant.
Very Important man.

238
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,837

239
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,755
Are we good?

240
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,033
I think we're good. I think we listened
to you. Please, por favor, por favor.

241
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,948
Please, por favor, por favor.

242
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,671
Yes.

243
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:42,794
What's the deal?

244
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,110
Well, the deal ls,
we're watchlng that house.

245
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,274
Couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

246
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,232
Yeah? What for?

247
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,714
A llttle blrdle told me
there's some guys...

248
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,992
...that have 3 pounds of our product
which they're selling.

249
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,316
And whlch they sure as hell
dldn't get from us.

250
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,191
So, what's the plan?

251
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,718
IJust told you.

252
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,514
We sit here and watch that house...

253
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,393
...untll one of our entrepreneurs
pops hls head out.

254
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,115
Then we ask a few questions
and get our property back.

255
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,040
Why don't you Just go
break the door down...

256
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:27,037
...pistol-whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

257
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:31,551
Because a little birdie also told me
these guys are into the product...

258
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,750
...and most likely armed.

259
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,316
Now, what you may not know
about meth-heads--

260
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,597
Or maybe you do.

261
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,074
They're kind of unpredictable.

262
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:46,113
I don't care for unpredlctable.
So we walt.

263
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,758
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90 percent of the job.

264
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,714
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.

265
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,112
Yes, slr.

266
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:07,870
Pimento cheese. How's that sound?

267
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,388
Where you going?

268
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:20,393
You said they're selling right?
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

269
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,108

00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,228
...but I know meth-heads.

l mlssed that one.
I'm sure It was good.

327
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,876
Wait, where you taking them?

328
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,039
-Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?
-I'm putting them on a bus.

329
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:56,072
-Why? What bus?
-One that takes them back to Honduras.

330
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,669
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

331
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,311
Walt, walt. Thls was my Idea.
Don't punlsh them.

332
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,238
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.

333
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,638


334
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,439
Give us a minute, will you?

335
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,351
We won't be too long.

336
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,879
The crew that hlt our truck
gave away the cargo...

337
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,956
...to a couple local nobodies.

338
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,550
Very disciplined of them,
not keeping anything for themselves.

339
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,399
It was all about sending a message.

340
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:09,227
Which they did, literally.

341
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:11,828
It was written on the bucket lid.

342
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,157
' Ready to talk?'

343
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,472
That, I belleve,
Is the Engllsh translatlon.

344
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:23,715
I know you're not really asklng
for advlce.

345
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,358
But let me hlre 1o, 15 more
good operators.

346
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:32,153
Then we hit them hard.
Hit them where they live.

347
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,714
No. This war stays cold for now.

348
00:38:40,959 --> 00:38:43,314
What about their message?
What's the answer?

349
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,839
Set up a meetlng.
Let's see what they have to say.

350
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,757
How did he do today?

351
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,310
I hear you can handle yourself.

352
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,118


353
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,598
Good nlght.

354
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,996
Hey, excuse me?

355
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,431
Why me?

356
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,877
I like to think I see things in people.

357
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:02,637
Slow down.
The car Is not golng anywhere.

358
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,796
-Mom.
-Hey, sweetheart.

359
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:11,672
-Hl.
-Hey.

360
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,870
-So did you see what's in the driveway?
-There you go.

361
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:20,670
Yeah, I saw.

362
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,638
Hey.

363
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,711
So that's yours, huh?

364
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,229
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

365
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,634
Well, that was very nice of him.

366
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,839
Yeah.

367
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,031
I know it looks like...

368
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,835
...well, awesome, but it's super safe.

369
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,393
Dad made sure.

370
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,750
And I promise
to always go the speed limit. Or below.

371
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,029
Way below.

372
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,596
And it gets great gas mileage.

373
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:57,475
So Dad said I can take it around
the block a few times. That okay?

374
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,995
Just around the block.

375
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,077
Yeah. Just around the block.

376
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,949
-And be careful, okay?
-I wlll.

377
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,153
Bye.

378
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,309
It's really-- It's really great
to have you home, Mom.

379
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,914

383
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,275

384
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,388
Did you get the car wash keys?

385
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,995
Yes. Yes. Here.

386
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:13,195
Skyler, I may have
overstated thlngs earller...

387
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,359
...and I'm sorry to be so forward.

388
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,675
But I just--
I want you to know somethlng.

389
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,438
I want you to--

390
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,200
I need you to understand...

391
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,475
...that you are safe.

392
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,799
You, Junlor, Holly.
You are completely safe.

393
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,635
Everything that I do, everything...

394
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,912
...I do it to protect this family.

395
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,512
So buying that car,
that was protecting your family?

396
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:52,638
Okay. I....

397
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,358
All right, maybe it's a little flashy,
but he needed a car...

398
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:02,438
...and I'm his father, and I should
be able to get what he wants.

399
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,510
It goes back.

400
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:09,188
Tomorrow.

401
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:17,588
That car dlrectly contradlcts
our story.

402
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,151
And If you're so Invested
In protectlng thls famlly...

403
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,079
...it means protecting the story.

404
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:27,032
What do you think the neighbours
are gonna say, Walt?

405
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:28,672
What about Hank and Marie?

406
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,589
How about the IRS?
What were you thinking, Walt?

407
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,351
I was thinking that I wanted
to do something nice for my son.

408
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,318
Look.

409
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,597
I just worry that he'll blame you
for thls.

410
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,877
on, he wlll.

411
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,789
Once agaln,
he'll blame hls bltch mother...

412
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:04,753
...for taking away
what his loving father has given him...

413
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,315
...so thanks for that.

414
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,789
But you know what, Walt?

415
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,430
Someone has to protect this family...

416
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,757
...from the man
who protects thls famlly.
