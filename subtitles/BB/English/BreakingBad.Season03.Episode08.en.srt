34
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,669

They won't really tell us anythlng.

103
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,548
They shot hlm l'our tlmes.

104
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,390
0h, Chrlst.

00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,995

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,871
Can you tell us anythlng
or any detalls?

116
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,508
nght now, all we know
Is two men ambushed Hank.

117
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,558
They dldn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexlcan natlonals.

118
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,995
Thelr tattoos lndlcated an aI'I'Illatlon
wlth the drug cartel.

119
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,231
Why dld they attack Hank?

120
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,798
We're not sure yet.

121
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,838
It could be In relatlon to a lnvestlgatlon
Hank was worklng...

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,278
...or It could be a message
to the DEA In general.

123
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:40,918
They had an axe.

124
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,195
The cartels tend to be dramatlc.

125
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,108
Jesus.

126
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,796
-Where are they? I mean, dld they--?
-Hank got both of them.

127
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,508
He kllled one outrlght, the other one's
upstalrs In crltlcal condltlon.

128
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,228
Your brother-ln-law's one tough
son of a bltch to take them both out...

129
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,960
...conslderlng
he dldn't even have hls gun.

130
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,675
He dldn't have hls gun?

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,677
Why dldn't Hank have hls gun?

132
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,469
Marle, the assault charge.

133
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,312
I had to suspend Hank
pendlng the lnvestlgatlon.

134
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,313
That means
I had to take away hls weapon.

135
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,959
You had to take It.

136
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,872
-lt's standard procedure. No one--
-Okay. All rlght, llsten.

137
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,431
It you all llstened to hlm from the start
and let hlm arrest that degenerate...

138
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,034
...he wouldn't have taken thlngs
Into hls own hands.

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,794
And he would've had a gun
and could've del'ended hlmsell'.

140
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,155
-Marle, let's Just--
-No. Just--

141
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,911
It's thelr I'ault.

142
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,036
He dldn't have a gun.

143
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,155
Honey, thls Isn't helplng you.

What klnd of partner are you?

146

You were supposed to back hlm up,

147
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,636
Where were you?

148

And you.

150
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,796
You're supposed

00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,950
...lnstead ol' taklng thelr guns...

152
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,838
...not supportlng them,

153
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,432

-The DEA Is not welcome here.
-Okay, honey.

159
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,515

Come on. Let's go slt down.

So I'm thlnklng maybe we should go

212
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:38,108
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

213
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:57,318
You know,
these eggs are really not too bad.

214
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,676
-Look at that.
-Look at what?

215
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,831
At what? Thls. These spots.

216
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,594
Thls lork ls absolutely I'llthy.

217
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,876
Tell me you see thls.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

218
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,237
Marle, those are Just water spots.

219
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,388
That's I'lne.

220
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,989
Those are not 'water spots.'

221
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,071
That's dlrt.

222
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,436
Thls sllverware's
obvlously not been cleaned.

223
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,114
It's covered In germs
from someone else's mouth.

224
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,429
God knows what.

225
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,274
Serlously, Aunt Marle,
It's water spots.

226
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,352
Ours at home aren't any better.

227
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,317
Yours at home are Irrelevant.
We're In a hospltal.

228
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:57,516
They need to be a hlgher standard.
They have a responslblllty.

229
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,158
Well, I'm not actually sure...

230
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,074
...II the caleterla necessarlly qualll'les
as belng part of the hospltal.

231
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,231
It's In the same bulldlng.
It's all under the same roof.

232
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,913
Do you thlnk that slck people...

233
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,639
...aren't eatlng

234
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,837
My God, how are you supposed
to survlve thls death trap?

235
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:18,196
Marle....

236
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,472
l survlved.

237
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,358
I had my lobectomy at thls hospltal.

238
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,112
Remember that?

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,389
Remember how scared we all were?

240
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,990
l dldn't wanna act llke It,
but I was terrllled.

241
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,268
All that week, all I could thlnk ol'...

242
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,877
...was how they were actually
golng to cut me open...

243
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,032
...and take out a part of me...

244
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,237
...that was wlth me my entlre llle.

245
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,550
I couldn't get that Image
out of my head.

246
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:02,038
l thlnk the scarlest part
was when they took me Into pre-op.

247
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:07,155
Lylng there,
waltlng for them to anesthetlse you.

248
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,548
Knowlng that you may never
wake up agaln.

249
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:23,189
Actually what I really remember
about that day...

250
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,748
...ls drlvlng to the hospltal.

251
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,638
Skyler, you remember me
wantlng to drlve that day?

252
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,912
Yeah.

253
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,754
Anyway, there we are.
We're drlvlng up Central...

254
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,957
...and we hlt every green llght.

255
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,035
I mean,
every slngle llght that we hlt...green.

256
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,389
It's Just-- When does that happen?

257
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,754
Just llke, bang, bang,
green the entlre way.

258
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,908
And the whole tlme,
all I could thlnk about was:

259
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,278
'Why today? Why?
Why can't I Just spend...

260
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,398
...a few extra mlnutes In the car
wlth my I'amlly?'

261
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:11,554
I never wanted to be stuck In trafﬁc
so bad In my llle.

262
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,673
At least I was wlth my lamlly.

263
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,351
I had that.

264
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,475
Anyway, I survlved thls place.

265
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,516
And I'm not half the man
your husband ls.

266
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,431
Yes?

267
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,715
What the hell Is golng on up there?

268
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,872
l was gonna ask you
the same questlon.

269
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,474
You know about my men?

270
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:10,154
I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?

271
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,154
What's the matter?
Spanlsh not good enough anymore?

272
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,111
l dldn't order thls, and my men
would never do thls on thelr own.

273
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,918
Someone gave the go-ahead.

274
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,269
Are you accuslng me?

275
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,949
I'm Just saylng
they wouldn't act on thelr own.

276
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,112
I am not In the hablt
of plcklng my own pocket.

277
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,357
I assume that the next shlpment
wlll be delayed.

278
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,875
-Any thoughts on when It mlght arrlve?
-A week, a month.

279
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,953
There's too much locus on the border.
We lay low for the tlme belng.

280
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,189
We lay low,
and then we get the real story...

281
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,792
...lrom my man who survlved.

282
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,678
Your man Is In custody.

283
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,908
God bless Amerlcal

284
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,547
He's Innocent untll proven gullty.

285
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,391
I'll get hlm the best lawyer...

286
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,516
...and then we'll learn the truth.

287
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,229
Well, keep me apprlsed.

288
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,069
Any tlme you got that close proxlmlty
to the splne...

289
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,469
...there's always gonna be cause
for concern...

290
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:10,312
...but as I say,
It's really too soon to tell.

291
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,947
He's out of surgery, at least, whlch Is--

292
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,316
-Out of surgery, on way to recovery.
-All rlght. And where's that?

293
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,435
Unfortunately, you can't see hlm yet.

294
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,669
We're gonna have to walt

295
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,356
How long wlll that take?

296
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,510
I can't really say. It could be hours.

297
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,830
But we'll let you know
Just as soon as you can see hlm.

298

Thank you.

299
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,439
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

300
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,510
Get some rest?

301
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,150
I'm not golng anywhere.

302
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,148

303
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,634
Well, Is anyone else

304
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,392
...or Is It Just me?

305
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,759
What If I ran over to the house
and plcked up a few thlngs?

306
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,388

390

Some of them were DEA, you know?

391
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,909

...that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar ls...

393
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,749
...but nobody knows about the guys
that brought hlm down.

394
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,675
I guess I never thought about It.

395
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:39,398
He sald that good guys never get Ink
llke the bad guys do.

396
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,917
So he gave It to me.

397
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,635
Flgured I'd read It.

398
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,956
