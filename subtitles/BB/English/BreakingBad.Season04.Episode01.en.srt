1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,913
How': It comlng?

2
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,149
Vary, very wall.

3
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,198
It's a flurry of deliveries.

4
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,118
Feels like Christmas morning.

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,878
It's exciting.

6
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,517
It's really coming together.
And I'd like to point out...

7
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,358
...that If you have
any understandable queatlona...

8
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:05,470
...about the price tag....

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,915
That sound? Quality.

10
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,477
At Pfizer, at Merck,
that unit would be right at home.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,113
That goes for all of it.

12
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,518
Good. I want you
to have what you need.

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,188
Well, I do" my proverbial cap
to you, sir.

14
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,515
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

15
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,947
Within a month, I'd say.

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,712
Two weeks.

17
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,712
0r, yeah, two weeks.

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,751
Good. Very good.

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,350
By the way,
that sample you asked me to run?

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,157
-I ran it, and it is quite good.
-Thank you very much, Gale.

21
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,157
-You can give that to Victor to discard.
-Sure.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,751
Is that our competition?

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,520
-l'm sorry?
-The....

24
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,676
It really is quite good.

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,953
The purity, of course, I'm speaking of,
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,239
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue colour...

27
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,668
...but if that is our competition...

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,031
...we have our work cut out for us,
so to speak.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,994
You don't have any competition, Gale,
not as far as I'm concerned.

30
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,589
After all, how pure can pure be?

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,910
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

32
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:31,998
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you
a purity of 96 percent.

33
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,953
I'm proud of that figure.
It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,391
However, this other product is 99.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,713
Maybe even a touch beyond that.

36
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,036
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph...

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,514
...to say for sure...

38
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,756
...but that last 3 percent...

39
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,952
...It may not sound like a lot,
but It la.

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,037
lt's tremendous.

41
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,868
It's a tremendous gulf.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,473
Gale, for our purposes,
96 percent will do Just flne.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,592
Please, don't let this trouble you.

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,076
Yeah. It's Juat....

45
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,712
I'd love to know
who aynthealaed It, la all.

46
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,310
A man who wants to work with me.

47
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,431
A trained chemist, like yourself.

48
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,910
But it won't happen.

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,310
I don't consider him a professional.

50
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,109
If he's not,
I don't know what that make: me.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,155
I'm not trying
to talk myself out of a Job--

52
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,590
With this person,
there are other considerations.

53
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,234
Hla la the beat I've ever seen,
hand: down.

54
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:51,191
And I look at this place
that you've bullt...

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,550
...the money you're investing...

56
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,034
...aparlng no expense.

57
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,396
And I know...

58
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,469
...I know that you want the best.

59
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,110
6353 Juan Tabo. Apartment 6.

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,709
No, no. Eubank's west.

61
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,594
lt's between Eubank and Spain,
but Mazatlan's closest.

62
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,870
I don't know. ljust heard the one...

63
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,674
...llke, you know, a backflre,
a truck backflrlng.

64
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,313
I came out of my apartment.
A couple came out.

65
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,192
No. No, nobody saw.

66
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,750
Did you guys see anybody?

67
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,111
Guys, did you--? I don't know
if they speak English too good.

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,356
I don't think they saw anybody.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,030
It was just this one loud--
This very loud pop and that was all.

70
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,674
No arguing or like that.

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,110
So you guys good in directions there?
You want me to...?

72
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,507
They coming east or west?

73
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,077
lf heading east, tell them there's
an Exxon on their left-hand side.

74
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,035
No. I'll stay on the line.

75
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,719
You know him?

76
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,309
We all heard this shot.
I don't think you ought to go in there.

77
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,829
Mister, this is a crime scene.
You don't wanna touch anything.

78
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,588
Mlater?

79
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,913

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,711

Drlve.

83
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,430
What the hell happened?

84
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,714
He'a gone?

85
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,911
Look at me.

86
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,718
Gone?

87
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,433
You sure?

88
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,712
-Gone. Splattered all over.
-0h, Jeaua.

89
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,674
Jesus. Oh, shit.

90
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,911
All right.

91
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,157


92
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,673
Shlt.

93
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,037
-All right, you do a sweep?
-Couldn't. People there.

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,995
People? He get himself seen
by these people?

95
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,394
What about you?

96
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,627
What about you?

97
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,989
Yeah. So what?

98
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,749
Just another looky-loo.

99
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,390
I guess I'd better get this over with.

100
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,271
Hey.

101
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,272
0h, Jeez, I woke you up.
I woke you up.

102
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,908
Are you coming In?

103
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,428
No. It's kind of my only time

ljuat needed to....

105
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,313


106
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,152
Sorry.

107
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,508
It's okay.

108
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:02,395
And thank you, big time, as always.

109
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,596
They seem to be getting bigger
instead of smaller.

110
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,836
Not really sure what that's all about.

111
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,356
Please, for God's sake...

112
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,278

Absolutely not, okay?
It's absolutely flne.

114
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,791
Okay.

115
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,318
Does this mean
what I think It means?

116
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,314
-What?
-You and Walt?

117
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,555
What?

118
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,558
Hls car Is In the driveway.
It's not a state secret.

119
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,799
In All right. Okay. I'm not presslng.
l]ust....

120
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,036
I think that it's great.

121
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,036
That's all, all right?

122
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,639
-l'm out of here.
-0kay.

123
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,833
Oh, hey. A big howdy-do
to Mr. l'm-Not-Here.

124
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,594
--in Albuquerque today.

125
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,679
But you know what? It always is when
you have 330 days of sunshine a year.

126
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,950
On mornlng commute,
northbound 25...

127
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,912
...we've got a two-car accldent
on the ﬁght shoulder.

128
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,838
You gotta be careful.
Also, from the west sIde...

129
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,634
...we've got another accident,
Paseo del Norte and Second Street.

130
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,751
That one's on the left shoulder,
so be on the lookout.

131
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,951
That's a look at your morning commute
on Coyote 102.5

132
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,031
Oh, hey.

133
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,389
-Breakfast?
-Yeah.

134
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,396
Yeah? Okay.

135
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,995
All right. What you want?

136
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,792
All right, look.

137
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,116
So I make it 10 to 9, which means--

138
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,232
Shut up.

139
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,194
Which means we need to start a cook
in the next 10 minutes...

140
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,832
...to keep to our schedule.

141
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,554


142
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,276
And as angry as he may be,
I don't believe he's willing...

143
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,038
...to forfeit an entire batch.

144
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,878
That just might make him angrier.

145
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,354
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

146
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,233
Isn't that
what this whole thing ls about?

147
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,078
That's right, genius. Watch me.

148
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,875
We ain't missing no cook.

149
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,710
We're closed.

150
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,033
Closed.

151
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,989
Saul Goodman and Associates.

152
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,873
I'll see if he's in. Please hold.

153
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,712
Saul, Skyler White calling.

154
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,918


155
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,868
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

156
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,910
-Saul.
-Hey.

157
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,110
Skyler Whlte.

158
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,955
What the hell does she want?

159
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,313
He's nowhere to be found.

160
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,590
I called his condo,
every number I have.

161
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,198
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

162
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,119
You're sure?

163
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,550
As in, you know where he is?

164
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,116
I'm not the man's keeper,
but Walt's a big boy. He'll turn up.

165
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,071
Mr. Goodman,
somethlng Is golng on.

166
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,794
Why would he leave his car
In my driveway?

167
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:53,150
People carpool to work, right?
It's good for the environment.

168
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,716
He carpools?
He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

169
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,433
Hey, you're breaking up there.

170
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,199
I didn't quite catch that last....

171
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,551
-You're a Chatty Cathy today.
-Okay, do you know anything?

172
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,036
Anything at all?
Please, I'm looking for some help here.

173
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:14,359
Look, Walter is fine, okay?
I guarantee that, hundred percent.

174
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:17,469
One hundred percent.

175
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,111
You got a passport, right?

176
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,517
Yeah. Albuquerque.

177
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,790


178
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:11,672
I need the number for a locksmith.

179
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,955
I don't know. Pick one.

180
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,311
-You sure there's nothing?
-No, it's not even me. It's state law.

181
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,272
Are you sure there isn't some sort of--?
I don't know.

182
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,118
No. Nothing.

183
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,471
Maybe a car registration.
That would have your address.

184
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,912
No, but I can't even get in my car.
My car keys were on the same ring.

185
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,031
My God, my credit cards, my--
It's all right, sweetheart.

186
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,948
My driver's licence, my chequebook.
l have to start cancelling all that.

187
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,198
My whole life was in that purse
and he just cut it right off my shoulder.

188
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,957
We could've been stabbed.

189
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,153
I'm sorry, really.
But without proof of resldency....

190
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,998
I can take you down to my shop.

191
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,475
You're welcome to wait,
file a police report.

192
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,830
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe this day.

193
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,634
I know. It's just, it's the law.

194
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,231
Oh, my God. My medication.
I bet It's gone.

195
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,828
Oh, God, not now, not this.
Gotta call the pharmacy.

196
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,597
Are you okay?

197
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,713
Please, just-- Please, just take her.
Please. Just take her, please.

198
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,998
Oh, God.

199
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,757
Not now.

200
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,348
No. Not now.

201
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:31,631
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Truly.

202
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,798
Here you go, sweetheart.
Oh, there you go.

203
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,598
How do you--?
How do you wanna deal with the bill?

204
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,917
l-- Unfortunately,
all my cash was taken so....

205
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,351
-That's fine. We'll mail it to you.
-Will you? You know where | live, right?

206
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,711
-Slr, again, thank you so much. Really.
-Yeah.

207
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,878
Hey there. I'm back.

208
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,231
How was PT?

209
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,191
I heard it was very good.

210
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,078
I'm really liking this new therapist.

211
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,874
He keeps me in the loop,
always has time for a phone call. lt's....

212
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,672
I Ilke It.

213
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,996
So?

214
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,715
Tell me all about it.

215
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,794
I heard you broke new ground today.

216
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,713
I broke new ground?

217
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,797
That's what he said. Tell me.

218
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,637
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes...

219
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,196
...whlch ls up from
my 15 and a half yesterday.

220
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,277
And this much less shit in my pants.

221
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,758
So, yeah, Marie, if you and him and
everybody in America took a vote...

222
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,474
...changed the meaning
of the English language...

223
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,716
...yeah, I guess
I 'broke new ground.'

224
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:48,637
Well, call it a figure of speech,
but I am seeing progress.

225
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,515
Deflnlte progress.

226
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,230
You're ordering a new rock?

227
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:00,158
l'm bidding on a new mineral.

228
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,558
It's a nice one.

229
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,670
What? It's pretty.

230
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,757
I need the thing.

231
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,473
Okay.

232
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,471
Okay.

233
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,151
It has all those pretty little crystals.
I like that.

234
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,077
Okay.

235
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,919
All right, I just wanna go on record,
we should all be wearing masks.

236
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,755
We should be wearing masks.

237
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,270
Bet he forgets the aluminium.

238
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,671
Guaranteed.

239
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,070
Guarantee he forgets.

240
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,392
Oh, you don't know
what the hell you're doing, do you?

241
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,511
You forgot the aluminium.

242
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,119
One of the first steps in the....

243
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,071
Son of a bitch.

244
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,792
All right,
let's talk about Gale Boettlcher.

245
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,316
He was a good man
and a good chemlst...

246
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,316
...and I cared about him.

247
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:18,393
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

248
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,235
He didn't deserve it at all.

249
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:29,235
But I'd shoot him again tomorrow
and the next day and the day after that.

250
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:33,910
When you make it Gale versus me,
or Gale versus Jesse...

251
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,316
...Gale loses, simple as that.

252
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,752
This Is on you, Gus.
Not me, not Jesse.

253
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,598
Gale's death is on you.

254
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,949
I mean, really,
what did you expect me to do...

255
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,277
...just simply roll over
and allow you to murder us?

256
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,755
That I wouldn't take measures,
extreme measures to defend myself?

257
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,995
Wrong.

258
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:04,708
Think again.

259
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,196
And whatever It Is
you're planning there...

260
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,755
...whatever it is, the point
that you're trying to make here...

261
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:15,235
...let me suggest
that you keep one thing In mlnd.

262
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,588
Wlthout us,
without Jesse and myself...

263
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,595
...you have no one
to make your product.

264
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,636
Certainly not him.

265
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,319
This person doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

266
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,195
Been watching him for weeks.
I know every step of his cook.

267
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:39,274
Do you really? You?

268
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,638
Really? Oh, so please tell me.

269
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:52,589
Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic
or aprotic? Because I forget.

270
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,669
If our reduction isn't stereospecific
how can our product be pure?

271
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:02,111
I mean, is 1-phenyl-1-hydroxy-
2-methylamino-propane...

272
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,515
...contalnlng, of course,
chlral centres...

273
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,473
...at carbons number one and two
on the propane chain?

274
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,715
Then reduction
to methamphetamine...

275
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,230
...ellmlnates which chlral centre
Is It agaln?

276
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,431
Because I forgot.

277
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:18,916
Come on, help me out, professor.

278
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,677


279
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,675
We're here. Come on. Let us work.

280
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:28,349
All his bullshlt aslde,
It's called a cook.

281
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,868
Everything comes down
to following a recipe.

282
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,434
Slmple, complicated,
It doesn't matter.

283
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,948
The steps never change...

284
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,150
...and I know every step.

285
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,920
Oh, is that what you want?

286
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:46,348
This short-order cook?
You're not flipping hamburgers.

287
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,120
What happens
when you get bad barrel of precursor?

288
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,752
How would you even know it?

289
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,873
And what happens in the summer
when the humidity rises...

290
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,594
...and your product goes cloudy?

291
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,237
How would you
guard against that, huh?

292
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,758


293
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,515
You do this, all you'll have left...

294
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:10,836
...is an $8 million hole in the ground.

295
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,758
This lab...

296
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,316
...thls equipment ls useless
without us.

297
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,559
Without Jesse and myself,
you have no new product.

298
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,670
You have no income.

299
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:25,872
Your people out there will not be paid.
Your distribution chain collapses.

300
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,991
Wlthout us...

301
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,357
...you have nothing.

302
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,838
You kill me, you have nothing.

303
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,034
You kill Jesse, you don't have me.

304
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,598
You won't do this.

305
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,756
You're too smart.

306
00:31:57,879 --> 00:31:59,392
You can't afford to do this.

307
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,272
Please.

308
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,555
Let us just go back to work.

309
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,351
We're here.

310
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,589
Let us work.
We're ready to go to work.

311
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,553
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

312
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,833
Well?

313
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,670
Get back to work.

314
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:43,109
Listen, we'll just lay this down.

315
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,393
Put him in feet first. Grab his shoe.

316
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:51,713
Here. Wait, wait, wait.
Just lift him up. There. All right.

317
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,394
Oh, God.

318
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,909
You push that way, I'll hold him in.

319
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,478
Okay, ready? One....

320
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,877
0h, shlt.

321
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,190
Walt, walt. Walt.

322
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,278
Forget that. Okay.

323
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,909
Come on. Up.

324
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,310
Get down.

325
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,351
Okay, okay.

326
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,998
I never use this stuff.
Are you sure It'll do the job?

327
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,313
Trust us.

328
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,314
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

329
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,237
No, I'm good. Thanks.

330
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:52,152
How you doing?

331
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:56,758
No, I mean, you know...

332
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,030
...how are you doing?

333
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,151
You did the only thing
that you could.

334
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:12,236
I hope you understand that.

335
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,197
Thoughts?

336
00:40:20,279 --> 00:40:24,511
Any thoughts
on what our next move might be?

337
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:26,637
What next move?

338
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,434
Our next move.

339
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,632
Our next move, given the fact that at
the first opportunity, Gus will kill us.

340
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:37,751
What, that wasn't an opportunity
just now?

341
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,196
Seemed like a damn good opportunity
to me.

342
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,550
-No, no.
-Golden, I would say.

343
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:46,195
We bought ourselves some time,
yes, but....

344
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,959
The question is how much.
He'll be looking for another chemist.

345
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,828
He's not gonna find another chemist.

346
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,429
Where Is he gonna find
another chemlst?

347
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,473
It's not just about somebody
being able to run a lab that big.

348
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,032
Someone he can trust...

349
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,914
...someone he knows
will keep their mouths shut.

350
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,509
Yeah. Good luck with that.

351
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,510
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

352
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,159
Bet he's sorry now.

353
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:29,230
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Now we all understand each other.

354
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:30,952
nght?

355
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,390
-What do you mean?
-I mean, him and us, we get It.

356
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,713
We're all on the same page.

357
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,189
And what page is that?

358
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:53,557
The one that says:

359
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,910
'II I can't kill you...

360
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,754
...you'll sure as shit wish
you were dead.'

361
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,074
Yo, excuse me.

362
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,432
Thanks.

363
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,637
-Here.
-Thank you, sir. Have a good one.

00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,350


367

lt's parked over on Amsden.

368
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,072
Junior was about to get up
and he would've seen it...

369
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:07,157
...so I wanted
to avoid a lot of questions.

370
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,672
Smart.

371
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,232
Well.

00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,995

Yeah.

379
00:43:39,439 --> 00:43:42,636
