25
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,193

...wlth those

43
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,439
I usually open wlth

44
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:04,635
Where would you llke to begln?

45
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,758
l reallyjust need thls qulck and easy,
you know?

46
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,550
As qulck as somethlng llke thls

47
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,953
Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along wlth that?

48
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,269
Does he know?

49
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,069
Well, I mean, he certalnly knows
we're separated, so....

50
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,638
Has he moved out?

51
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,835
We're In the process
of movlng hlm out.

52
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,148
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

53
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,154
And In the meantlme,
my son and my daughter...

54
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,991
...and l are staylng wlth my slster.

55
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,709
-So you've moved out?
-Well, yes, Just temporarlly.

56
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,074
Only so he could
get hls thlngs and....

57
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:45,027
That was supposed to happen last week,
but then came the crash and....

58
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,997
Oh, God, you weren't one of the--?

59
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,958

60
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:56,228
And we had debrls land In our yard,
and all over our nelghbourhood, so....

61
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,118
-Terr|ble.
-Yeah. Apparently, even...

62
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,112
...you know, parts of bodles.

63
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,750
So I certalnly couldn't

64
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,831
-So awful.
-I know.

65
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:12,196
Anyway, I was certalnly not ready
to move back. But It's tlme.

66
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:17,069
And I'm sure we're drlvlng
my slster and her husband up a wall.

67
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:20,709
Well, you deflnltely wanna malntaln
resldency In your actual home.

68
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,428
It Just puts you In a better posltlon
In regards to custody.

00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,717
-How long have you been marrled?
-8|xteen years.

73
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,474
And It's not an apartment,
It's a house that you llve In?

74
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,755
Do you own outrlght,
do you have a mortgage...?

75
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,675
Yes, there's deflnltely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on It.

76
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,593
What about other debts or assets?

77
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,750
Do you feel
you have a good understandlng...

78
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,150

-Is your husband employed?
-Here's the thlng.

80
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,473
I'm really not looklng
for any sort of loopholes...

81
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,791
-...or I don't know, Just--
-No, no loopholes.

82
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,158
IJust lntend that every one of my cllents

83
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:22,278
...of what It Is they owe
and what It Is they own.

84
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,273
To that end,
I say let's leave no stone unturned.

85
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,268
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hlde from one another.

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,796
IJust keep asklng myself,
'Why dld thls happen?‘

162
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,152
I mean, If there's a God and all...

163
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,756
...why does he allow all those
Innocent people to dle for no reason?

164
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,710
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeplng much.

165
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,071
Does anyone else have that?

166
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,870
IJust keep hearlng that sound.

167
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,757
That boom.

168
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,792
It Just plays over and over In my head
llke It won't ever stop.

169
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,830
Thank you, sweetheart.

170
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,754
-Is there anyone else?
-Over here.

171
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,192
My nelghbour, he heard the crash...

172
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,313
...and he ran outslde,
and he found, llke, thls seat.

173
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,478
lee an alrllne seat.

174
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,311
lee what you have on a alrllner?

175
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:30,950
Well, anyway, the seat was standlng
perfectly uprlght In hls front yard...

176
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,557
...rlght next to hls Sea-Doos,
because, llke, he has Sea-Doos.

177
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,992
But there was stlll a palr of legs
buckled Into them.

178
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,352


179
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,871
Jesus H. Chrlst.

180
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,680
-You okay?
-Yeah, sorry. I'm....

181
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,875
l was Just moved.

182
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:57,870
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

183
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,034
Certalnly thls tragedy
dldn't only affect our students.

184
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,039
Mr. Whlte,
would you llke to say somethlng?

185
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,032
And by the way, welcome back.

186
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,391
It's so good to have you back.

187
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,232
I guess what I would-- Sorry, sorry.

188
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,355
I guess what I would wanna say ls...

189
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,149
...to look on the brlght slde.

190
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,796
Flrst of all,
nobody on the ground was kllled.

191
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,358
And that...

192
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,831
I mean, an lncldent llke thls,
over a populated urban centre?

193
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:09,551
That rlght there, that's Just gotta be
some mlnor mlracle. So....

194
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:12,870
Plus, nelther plane was full.

195
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,229
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe
two-thlrds full, I belleve? nght, yes?

196
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,709
Or maybe even three-quarters full?

197
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,237
Well, at any rate,
what you're left wlth casualty-wlse...

198
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,313
...Is Just the 50th-worst aIr dlsaster.

199
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,312
Actually, tled for 50th.

200
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,198
There are, In truth...

201
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,476
...53 crashes throughout hlstory...

202
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:45,757
...that are Just as bad or worse.
Tenerlfe.

203
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,754
Has anybody...?
Anybody hear of Tenerlfe? No?

204
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,871
In 1977, two fully loaded 747s...

205
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,474
...crashed Into each other on Tenerlfe.

206
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,516
Does anybody know how blg
a 747 Is?

207
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,718
I mean, It's way blgger than a 737,
and we're talklng about two of them.

208
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,032
Nearly 600 people dled on Tenerlfe.

209
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,593
But do any of you even remember It
at all? Any of you? I doubt It.

210
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,629
You know why?
It's because people move on.

211
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:23,913
They Just move on.

212
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,469
And we wlll too. We wlll move on,
and we wlll get past thls.

213
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,159
Because that Is what human belngs do,
we survlve, and....

214
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:39,635
We survlve and we overcome. Yeah.

215
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,835
We survlve. We survlve and--

216
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,310
-Okay?
-Thank you.

217
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,633


218
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,428
Hey, how's your Aunt Marle dolng?

219
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,599
Flne. I guess.

220
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,193
You make sure you say hello to her
for me, wlll you?

221
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:36,193
Why don't you Just come Inslde?
It's your house.

222
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,036


223
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,153


224
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,118
-How's what?
-Tr|cks. It's an expresslon.

225
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,918
How are you?

226
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,151
Why you gotta treat hlm llke thls?

227
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,753
Why you gotta be llke thls?

228
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,276
-Why can't you Just talk even?
-Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

229
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,393
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

230
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,036
You know, try not to hold It
agalnst hlm.

231
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,638
You know, I mean, the poor kld,
he's probably Just dylng of curloslty.

232
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,920
You know, and I guess
It would be natural for hlm to wonder.

233
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,549
He's probably wonderlng, 'What Is If
that could have gone so wrong...

234
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:12,313
-Mar|e. Marle.
-...that my mother would leave--?'

235
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:14,197
I can't help you get through thls...

236
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,318
...you know, If you won't tell me
what It Is that Walt dld?

237
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,870
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asklng you, all rlght?

238
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,349
So If you wanna be supportlve,
you could be supportlve wlthout prylng.

239
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,396
-That would be really great...
-'Pry|ng.'

240
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,472
-...and so helpful.
-Well, prylng's a strong word.

241
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,752
It's that volce lnslde your head.

242
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,553
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard,
24I7 volce.

243
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,198
You know what I'm talklng about.

244
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,032
That volce that tells you
you're not good enough.

245
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,074
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what...

246
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,356
...presldent of the Unlted States?

247
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:01,709
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

248
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,508
But now...

249
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,310
...are you good enough to deserve
your share of baslc human happlness?

250
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,277
Are you good enough to be okay
wlth who and what you are?

251
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,590
I say yes.

252
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,669
But It doesn't matter what I say.

253
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,833
It's your volce, whlch means
you're the one that hears It.

254
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:28,878
Whlch means you're the only one
that can flght It, rlght?

255
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,715
Jesse, we never hear from you.

256
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,469
What's golng on? You can tell me
I'm full of shlt. It's okay, I don't mlnd.

257
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:41,949
Just come on. Let us In on It.

258
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,632
So, llke, what makes you the expert?

259

'forglve yourself,‘ blah, blah, blah.

262
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,274
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

263
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,432
I don't Just mean dlsappolnted

00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:19,276
...but dld you ever really

00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,553
l kllled my daughter.

266
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,559
It was July 18th,

267
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:38,917
July 1am, 1992.

268
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,594
l was hlgh on cocalne
and l was drunk.

269
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,878
Cocalne wasn't an Issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a blrthday present.

270
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,473
I had plenty left.

271
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,153
But I was out of vodka.

272
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,151
And thls Is In Portsmouth, Vlrglnla...

277
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,551
Come on.
They're not gonna sell It to me.‘

278
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,794
And she's saylng 'No, no.'

279
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:25,589
So I'm plssed. And the clock Is tlcklng,

280
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,068
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

281
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:34,231
She's playlng
at the end of the drlveway.

282
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:37,794


283
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,200
How do you not hate yourself?

284
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,276

285
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,199
But It dldn't stop me
from drlnklng and gettlng hlgh.

286
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,954
It Just made If that much worse.

287
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:04,350
Self-hatred, gullt,
It accompllshes nothlng.

288
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,080
It Just stands In the way.

289
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,235
Stands In the way of what?

290
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,711

There's your slde and there's my slde,

306
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,791
You haven't heard any of It at all.

307
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,029
You're a drug dealer.

00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,912

00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,751

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,508

But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

318
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,590

00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,317
...lt really could be looked at
llke a wake-up call for both of us.

342
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:11,234
I mean, you know, Just to get our llves
back together agaln...

343
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:15,392

You been followlng
thls alrplane crash?

345
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,033

346
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,793
You know It was Jane's dad who

at play there.

353
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,879
Yeah?

354
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:55,033

colllslon radar on the Jet...

355
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,872
...that may not have been worklng.

356

Is run on 1960s technology.

00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:09,151
