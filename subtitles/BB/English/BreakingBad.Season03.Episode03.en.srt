229
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,547

We had no reaaon to belleve
the man waa of concern to you.

231
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:58,074


232
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,320
So you're In bualneaa wlth
thla Helaenberg.

233
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:04,074
I don't know hlm by that name, but yea.

234
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,151
I've made no aecret ol' the fact that...

235
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,472
...l have alwaya done bualneaa
wlth certaln local manul'acturera.

236
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:15,156
You and I,
we atlll make money together.

237
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:20,192
lt'a never affected our relatlonahlp.

238
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,511
Don Salamanca had a
nephew named Tuco.

239
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,028
Yea, I knew of hlm.

240
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,154
Then perhapa you know Don Salamanca
mentored hlm In the bualneaa.

241
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,313
Thought of Tuco aa a aon.

242
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:39,508
When Don Salamanca waa no longer
able, Tuco took over for hla uncle.

243
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:42,756
He waa a key man In our
organlaatlon north of the border.

244
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,999
He waa loyal.

245
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,711
Thla Helaenberg, Walter Whlte...

246
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,348
...he waa one of Tuco'a local auppllera.

247
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,556
Untll he betrayed Tuco.

248
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,712
So now you aee,
blood muat be repald by blood.

249
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,518
Tuco'a coualna here...

250
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,318
...they have the rlght
to exact vengeance.

251
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:04,988
The Salamanca famlly, the cartel...

252
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,958

But I am preaently engaged In
bualneaa wlth thla man.

259
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,079
When our bualneaa la done...

260
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,911
...he wlll no longer be
of any concern to me.

261
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,513
Untll then...

262
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,548

263
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,997

I don't tell you how to

265
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,875
You ahould really leave mattera

266
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,310
