00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,997
I'm on the starshlp Enterprlse,
macklng on Yeoman Rand...

171
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:48,397
...thIe the Andorlan wlth the dlsruptor
Is back on Talos IV, or whatever.

172
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,830
What do you thlnk
all those sparkles and shlt are?

173
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,870
Transporters
are breaklng you apart, man.

174
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,151
Down to your molecules and bones.
They're maklng a copy.

175
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,638
That dude who comes out on the other
slde? He's not you. He's a colour Xerox.

176
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,837
So you're telllng me every tlme
Klrk went Into the transporter...

177
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,188
...he was kllllng hlmself?

178
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,591
So over the whole serles,
there's, llke, 147 Klrks?

179
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,352
At least. Dude, why do you thlnk
McCoy never llkes to beam nowhere?

180
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,633
Because he's a doctor, bltch.
Look It up. It's sclence.

181
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,398
I ever tell you about
my Star Trek scrlpt?

182
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,910
-Star Trek scrlpt?
-Yeah. I gotta wrlte It down, Is all.

183
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,313
The Enterprlse
Is flve parsecs out of ngel XII.

184
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,908
Nothlng's golng on.
Neutral zone Is qulet.

185
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,873
The crew Is bored,
so they put on a ple-eatlng contest.

186
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,913
The whole crew's In the galley.
They're eatlng tulaberry ples.

187
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,679
-Tulaberry?
-Tulaberr|es, from Gamma Quadrant, yo.

188
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,387
-That's Voyager, dude.
-Okay, blueberrles, then.

189
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,477
-They're eatlng blueberry ples...
-Better.

190
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,877
...as fast as the repllcator
can churn them out:

191
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,238
Flnally It's down to Just three:
Klrk, Spock and Chekov.

192
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,714
Okay, Spock always wlns these thlngs.

193
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,871
How Is Spock gonna beat Klrk, yo?
Spock's llke a toothbrush.

194
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,752
Look at Klrk. He's got room to spare.

195
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:11,231
Spock has total Vulcan control over hls
dlgestlon. You wanna hear thls or not?

196
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,159
-Yeah. Yeah, go.
-Okay. Flnally, Klrk...

197
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,920
...he can't take It anymore. He yorks.

198
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,713
Now It's Just down
to Chekov and Spock.

199
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,277
But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole
fat stack of quatloos rldlng on thls...

200
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,074
...and he has flgured out a way to wln.

201
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,114
He's got Scotty back In the Transporter
Room locked In on Chekov's stomach.

202
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,277
Every tlme Chekov eats a ple,
Scotty beams It rlght out of hlm.

203
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,828
-Where's he sendlng them? The tollet?
-Space.

204
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,758
There's blueberrles Just floatlng
out there, frozen, because It's In space.

205
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,474
And Chekov Is Just
shovelllng them Into hls mouth...

206
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,996
...and Spock's llke, 'I can't belleve
thls Russlan Is defeatlng me.'

207
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:51,434
Meanwhlle,
Scotty's In the Transporter Room...

208
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,716
...flddllng wlth levers
when Lleutenant Uhura comes In.

209
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,470
She's got, you know, her blg polntles,
and Scotty's flngers are all sweaty.

210
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,398
-No.
-Chekov screams.

211
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,068
He sprays blood out of hls mouth.

212
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,039
Scotty beamed hls guts Into space.

213
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,234
No way.

214
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,232
Hey, man, where you golng?
You're mlsslng the best part.

215

216
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,878
You know you can't

217
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,788

00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:39,878
Woody Harrelson, llve and In person.
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

221
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,117
Hey, I'm klddlng about the bong.
Don't be dolng that.

222
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,437
Sorry to keep you on Ice out there, kld.
If I'd known It was you....

223
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
Well, that Francesca,
I've warned her before.

224
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,472
One more tlme
and It's back to the DMV.

225
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,797
So are we on our own today?

226
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,635
Barn door open.

227
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,671
Barn door?

228
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,679
So how Is the maestro?
Thlngs have been qulet on thls end.

229
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,318

231
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:13,513
That whole thlng In the Jalls.
I mean...

232
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,717
...when they start to whack lawyers,
that's when I draw the llne.

233
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,309

Scratch that. I don't know,

242
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,716
The thlng Is, what those folks want
Is to know what happened to thelr boy.

243
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,707
A sack full of cash on thelr doorstep?

247
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,871

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,793

249

You better belleve

A couple mllllon bucks shows up,

260
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,594
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twlce.

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,950
-What, are you golng for a hat trlck?

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,239
Yeah, there's a problem.

00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:40,078
There's 5 mllllon of them

274
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,917
Calm down.

275
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,718
I'll handle It.

276
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,110
Deja vu, huh?

277
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,633
Jesus.

278
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,952
All rlght, look...

279
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,638
...you wanna talk me through thls?

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,830
What you were thlnklng?

281
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:12,196
What you asked Saul to do.
I mean, come on.

282
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,390
It's Just nonsenslcal.

283
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,038
Do you--?

284
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,677
Do you have any explanatlon at all?

285
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:33,518
-Blood money.
-What?

286
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,912
It's llke you sald.

287
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,675
It's blood money.

288
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,194

289
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,475
Jesus. Okay, yes, all rlght. l sald that.

290
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,319


291
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:55,350
But It was In the heat of the moment.
I was trylng to wln an argument.

292
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,948
All rlght? And I was wrong.

293
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,950
Thls Is your money.

294
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,389
Come on, you've earned It.

295
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,278
Drew Sharp.

296
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,072
That Is a terrlble memory,
no doubt about It.

297
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,758
But, son...

298
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,629
...you need to stop focuslng
on the darkness behlnd you.

299
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,274
The past Is the past.

300
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,557
Look, nothlng can change
what we've done.

301
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,515
But now that's over.

302
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,078
You're out.

303
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,917
And so am I.

304
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,638
That's rlght. I'm done.

305
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,151
I've been out for about a month.

306
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,676
But there Is nothlng left
for us to do except to try...

307
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,512
...to llve...

308
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,479
...ordlnary, decent llves.

309
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:42,799
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

310
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,147
She needs someone looklng after her.

311
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:55,078
Mlke Is perfectly capable
of looklng after hls own granddaughter.

312
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,431
I don't thlnk so.

313
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:02,073
I don't thlnk he Is capable.

314
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:04,709
I don't thlnk he's comlng back.

315
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,910
What--? What are you saylng?

316
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,235
You dolng what you dld...

317
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,153
...offlng Mlke's guys?

318
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,392
If he was out there...

319
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,676
...you'd have to look over your shoulder
for the rest of your llfe.

320
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:25,555
And that's not how you do thlngs.
So I thlnk he's dead...

321
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:28,195
...and l thlnk you know that.

322
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,310
I don't know that.

323
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,271
I don't.

324
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,438
Llsten to me.

325
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:44,192
I dld not klll Mlke.

326
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:50,474
The last tlme that I saw hlm, he had
hls bag, the one that I brought hlm.

327
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:52,670
And he got Into hls car,
and he drove away.

328
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:55,757
And for all I know, he's allve and well.

329
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,629
And If--

330
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,589

00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,673

453
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,909
You don't glve a shlt about famllyl

454
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,960
Hank, my cancer Is back.

455
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,907


456
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,229

I wanna beat thls thlng, I do.

459

I'm back on chemo,
and I am flghtlng llke hell.

460
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,910
But the truth Is, In slx months,
you won't have someone to prosecute.

461
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:06,357
But even--

462
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,680
Even If somehow you were
able to convlnce anyone...

463
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,519
...that l was capable
of dolng these thlngs...

464
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,478
...you and I both know I would
never see the lnslde of a Jall cell.

465
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,711
I'm a dylng man...

466
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,832
...who runs a car wash.

467
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:34,555
My rlght hand to God,
that Is all that I am.

468
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:40,591
What's the polnt?

469
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,875
Have Skyler brlng the klds here.

470
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,596
And then we'll talk.

471
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:57,034
That Is not golng to happen.

472
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,836
I don't know who you are.

473
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,713
I don't even know who I'm talklng to.

474
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,311
If that's true...

475
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,950
...If you don't know who I am...

476
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:26,874
...then maybe your best course...

477
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,872
...would be to tread llghtly.
