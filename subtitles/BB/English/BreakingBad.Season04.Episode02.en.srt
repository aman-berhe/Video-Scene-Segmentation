1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,394
So how': It look?

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,587
Meaning, do | see it?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,879
You.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,479
Do you no It?

5
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,592
Basically, any lawman worth his salt
is gonna spot that, yeah.

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,470
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,273
Yes, it's a deal breaker.

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,707
Wall, ll' stealth
I: what you're aspiring to...

9
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:41,197
...you best go
with something more compact.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,033
Thirty-eight Special.

11
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:44,194


12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,957
Got a concealed hammer...

13
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,673
...so It don't catch on your belt
when you draw.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,838
Tried and true.
No nonsense about It.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,519
-Flve shots.
-Yeah.

16
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,437
Automatic has how many?

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,756
Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.

18
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,110
If you can't get it done with five,
you're into spray and pray...

19
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:07,153
...in which case, I wouldn't count
on another six closing the deal.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,035
You load that
with 158-graln hollow points...

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,994
...instead of standard wadcutters,
it's got plenty of stopping power.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,555
Can't get more dependable
than a wheel gun.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,668
Try It on with this.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,277
That snubbie will conceal up real nice
if you carry it IWB.

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,392
Little harder to draw from,
but there's no substitute...

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,273
...ll' you're Intent
on l'oollng a vlgllant eye.

27
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,912
Comes in polymer too.

28
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,508
I prefer the feel of leather.

29
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,074
Old school, I guess.

30
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,108
Sure it's on the correct side?

31
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,991
If you're right-handed, it is.

32
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,469
I don't know, ma-- Are you sure?

33
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,318
Maybe It'll feel better
on the left side.

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,795
General rule,
you don't wanna cross-draw.

35
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,194
Not unless you're gonna be sitting.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,836
You know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

37
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:18,390
Either way, you're gonna wanna
practise your draw. A lot.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,716
Because if you're all fingers...

39
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,229
...well, it might could be him
keeping the peace instead of you.

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,953
Catch my drift?

41
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,517
What's this?

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,429
That Is why you're gonna pay me
five times...

43
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,233
...what you'd pay
your neighbourhood gun store.

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,753
Serial number's been filed off.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,591
So to state the obvious...

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,553
...I don't wanna be caught with this
on me.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,036
No. To state the obvious, you don't.

48
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,511
You know, mister, I've been providing
my services for the past 30-odd years.

49
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,991
Think l'd learn better
than to ask a man his business...

50
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,474
...especlally not one referred
by the lawyer.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,591
But I do feel the urge to ask you...

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,034
...are we strlctly talklng defence
here?

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,879
Yes, absolutely.

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,035
Defence.

55
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,639
Why?

56
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:18,434
Because
If It's Just personal protection...

57
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,233
...aside from a bucket of money...

58
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,909
...you'd save yourself
a potential felony two-spot...

59
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,193
...for carrying a weapon with a defaced
serial number if you buy it legally.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,997
But if you did have to use it,
wouldn't it still be better to use one...

61
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,598
...that couldn't be traced?

62
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,118
This is the West, boss.

63
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,596
New Mexico's
not a retreat Jurlsdlctlon.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,950
Man steps to you bent
on doing you harm...

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,948
...you got every right to plant your feet
and shoot to kill.

66
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,675
Some call it a moral right, and I do
include myself within that class.

67
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,118
All this to say,
I'm happy to take your money.

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,477
But if you're not a convicted felon...

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,480
...you might best be advised
to bear your arms...

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,240
...within the confines of the law.

71
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,636
It's for defence.

72
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,471
Defence.

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,554
I'll take It.

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,677
Thanks, Bonnle.

75
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,869
Jesse.

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,752
What's up, brother?

77
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,274
Dude, sounds like an earthquake
out there.

78
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,034
New sound system.

79
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,278
-Check It out.
-Bodaclous subwoofers, yo.

80
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,959
Serlous cannons.

81
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,275
Eighteen-inchers, six of them.

82
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,029
Aluminium cones, so they're
really, really, like, sonically neutral.

83
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,513
Tweeters are killer too.

84
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,917
Dig all them lines jumping around.
Psychedelic.

85
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,959
Kind of like Just wanna stare
at them.

86
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,754
Yeah, man, totally makes me wanna
crank old Sabbath and blaze one.

87
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,190
It's got, like, parametric equalisation.

88
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,279
Automatically adjusts the levels to
changes in air pressure and whatnot.

89
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,271
It's totally dlgltal.

90
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,028
Vacuum tube amp, which is by far
the best, anti-distortion-wise.

91
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:53,390
Hits 120 declbels
without breaking a sweat.

92
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,990
Hold onto your hats, bitches.

93
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,637
Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting
yesterday.

94
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,909
She asked about you.

95
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,154
Thanks, man,
but 12 steps and all that.

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,519
Seriously?

97
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,071
Maybe just a little bump.

98
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:16,397
Left 4 Dead. Bitches get all cranial
when you cap them in the head, like:

99
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,671
No, no, no, man. Resident Evil 4
takes it by a long shot.

100
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,553
-Please, brother. You're fronting.
-No, seriously.

101
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,877
That chick, the one you gotta rescue?
She's smoking, bro.

102
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,117
And then you're, like,
the last undead dude on earth.

103
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,197
How can you not be dlpplng
Into that?

104
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
Talk about inspiring a brother
to kick zombie ass.

105
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,868
They're trying to eat your brain.
A dude don't need no more motivation.

106
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,474
Falr point, I guess.

107
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,953
Okay, okay, okay.

108
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,674
Call of Duty: World at War,
zomble mode.

109
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,553
Now, that's the bomb, man.
Thlnk on It, bro.

110
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,433
They're not just zombles,
they're Nazl zombles.

111
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,472


112
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,671
Yeah, man. SS Waffen troopers too...

113
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,714
...which are like the baddest ass Nazis
of the whole Nazi family.

114
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,468
What difference does it make what
their job was when they was living?

115
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,636
Dude,
you are so hlstorlcally retarded.

116
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,071
Nazi zombies don't wanna eat you just
because they're craving the protein.

117
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,793
They do It because--

118
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:16,833
They do It
because they hate Americans, man.

119
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,511
Talibans. They're the Talibans
of the zombie world.

120
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,393
I played the game.
They ain't exactly fleet of foot.

121
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,431
I'm saying, where's the challenge?

122
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,359
The zombies in Left 4 Dead
clock a respectable 40.

123
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,074
-You gotta lead them.
-They're not even zombles.

124
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,553
They're just infected.

125
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,557
They got, like, this rage virus...

126
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,399
...amps them up
like they been smoking the schwag.

127
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,593
Apples and oranges, bro.
Totally unfair to compare the two.

128
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,593
Yo, Jesse,
where do you come out on all this?

129
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,157
Agree. Totally.

130
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,472
Did that just happen?

131
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,798


132
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,151
It's qulet.

133
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,992
You know what this place needs?

134
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,469
You okay?

135
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,193
Flne.

136
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,711
Can't you sleep?

137
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,990
Actually, yes, Marie. This is me
sleeping. What's it look like?

138
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,317
It looks like you're looking at a rock.

139
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,390
At 2:24 in the morning.

140
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,752
This is not a rock, this is a mineral,
for, like, the 10th time.

141
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,038
Okay.

142
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,274
Got It.

143
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,436
Blue corundum, to be precise.

144
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,949
Blue corundum.
Well, It's very pretty.

145
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,993
lt's encrusted with igneous biotite
in a mica schist.

146
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,397
Would you like some more detail?
Because I can give it to you.

147
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,479
You can keep acting
like you give the first shit--

148
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,874


149
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,387
Found In the Central Cordillera
of lrlan Jaya.

150
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,874
Blue corundum.

151
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,028
I'm just saying.

152
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,275
It's 2 In the morning.

153
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:22,676
I'm just asking if maybe--

154
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,792
You know, last I counted, Marie, there
were four bedrooms in this house.

155
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,030
You know, I mean,
if I'm keeping you awake and all.

156
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,438
You've reached Walter White.
Please state your name...

157
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,074
...number and reason for your call.
Thank you.

158
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,758
Wall?

159
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,589
Hello? Walt?

160
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,312
Okay, Walt,
could you call me back, please?

161
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,829
Hank's mm are really startlng
to pIIe up here.

162
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,518
And in the meantime...

163
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:37,836
...I haven't recelved a cheque from you
In qulte a thIe.

164
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,350
Second order of buslness
Is the car wash.

165
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,438
-Godl
-So It's tlme to take the next step here.

166
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,473
We need to look
into buying this car wash while we--

167
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
Skyler, what are you doing?

168
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,759
What do you mean?

169
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,192
-Wait, are you screening all my calls?
-No, no, no, I'm just--

170
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,709
What are you thinking leaving
a message like that on my machine?

171
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,511
What are you--? What did I say?

172
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:07,190
You just left recorded proof
of our intention to buy a car wash.

173
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,993
-Now, you think that was wise?
-Proof of our what?

174
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,599
What are you talking about?

175
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,076
Skyler, we should not even be
mentioning the words "car wash"...

176
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,871
...on the phone at all. Period.

177
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,197
Walt, it is a car wash, not a brothel.

178
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,109
I mean, if we can't even say what it is,
why are we buying it at all?

179
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,276
God, look, Skyler, please, just--

180
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,468
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, hon.

181
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,717
Look, there's some cereal
on the breakfast table.

182
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,151
I'm telling you,
if you're not willing to pull the trigger...

183
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,715
...l'm more than happy
to call Goodman myself.

184
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,356
No, no, no, lwill handle it, okay?

185
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,829
I could so use a brain transplant
right now.

186
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,793
Yeah. I'm going to work.

187
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,389
Wake up, bltch.

188
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,030


189
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,237
You're way too sensitive
about your zone, bro.

190
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:07,552
Come on, man. Cleanup time.

191
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,069
Right on. Least we can do.

192
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,273
Hey, the hell with cleaning up.

193
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,029
Just go out
and get everybody some breakfast.

194
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,993
Stock up on liquor while you're at it.
Keep this party going.

195
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,268
I mean It, yo.

196
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,519
I mean, I want this place kicking harder
than a sensei when | get back.

00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,751
-All right.

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,189


201
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,188
-Yo, you the new guy?
-Yeah.

202
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:19,957
You got something for me?

203
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,153
Two hundred and one point six.

204
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,712
What's the count?

205
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,870

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,954
Give It a second welgh,

209
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,915
-Where's Gus?
-Why?

210
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,589
Because I would like to speak
with him.

211
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:58,068
Because the way we left things,
I would like the chance to clear the air.

212
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:02,038
What?

213
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,953
Walter,
you're never gonna see him again.

214
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:21,032
Oh, look who woke up hungry.

215
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,433
Are you hungry?

216
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,835
Yeah, that's good. Drink that up.

217
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,549
Just a little longer,
okay, my sweetle?

218
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,351
Okay?

219
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,198
There you go.

220
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,550
Okay, now.

221
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,953
The Dodge gets a detail...

222
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,439
...and the Corolla...

223
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,278
...gets a hand wax.

224
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,515
Right? Hand wax.

225
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,278
Okay.

226
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,838
Hello. Hello. Just a few more minutes
and then we're on our way home.

227
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,712
Okay, my sweet girl?

228
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,513
Mama's just doing her work here.

229
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,915
Mama's doing her work.

230
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,396
Way to go, Hank.

231
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:14,915
Come on, way to soldier up.

232
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,352
You're doing it. Come on.

233
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,271
Another few yards.

234
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,992


235
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:28,391
Jesus.

00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,837
Look at you. Way to go, honey.

237
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,395
Come on. Come on, Hank.

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,752
Keep It golng.

239
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,589
Just ten more steps.

240
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:42,914


241
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,112
Elght.

242
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,469
Seven.

243
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:51,675


244
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,392
You're almost there, Hank.

245
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:04,356
All right, buddy.
That's what I call kicking some ass.

246
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,279
Oh, that was awesome, babe.

247
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,233

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,359
Great sesslon.
Lots of positive energy.

256
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,198
Lots.

257
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,553
It's just-- It's so great to see that.

258
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,990
It's just....

259
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,348
Yeah.

260
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,794
One day at a time.

261
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,352
All we can do.

262
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,551
I know. It's just....

263
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,431
You've got a real way with him.

264
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,353
lt's....

265
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,156
You wanna go full time?
We've got a spare bedroom.

266
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,157
I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,674
Wow, you were so strong today.

268
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,234
Did you work up an appetite?
I'm sure you did.

269
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,000
Listen, I was thinking
about cooklng tonight, so--

270
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,393
Marle.

271
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,793
Get out.

272
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,431
Oh, yo, about time. Oh, my God.

273
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:45,073
Yo, what's up with the pie, man?
It ain't cut.

274
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,952
-Yeah, right. That's the glmmlck.
-What glmmlck?

275
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,947
This place, they don't cut their pizza,
they pass the savings on to you.

276
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,151
How much can It be
to cut a damn plzza?

277
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,237
Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro.

278
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:59,590
You know, cut your own
Christmas tree, cut your own pizza.

279
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,198
Yeah, It's democratlc.

280
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,439
-What am I supposed to do with this?
-Don't sweat it.

281
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,835
You got some, like, scissors?

282
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,678
I will cut this bitch up good.

283
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,115
Yo, come In.

284
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,878
Hey, would you...?

285
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,072
Gotta figure, you make, like,
10 million plzzas a year.

286
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,715
Each plzza takes, like,
10 seconds to cut?

287
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,114
In man-hours, that's....

288
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,359
I don't know.

289
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,074
A lot?

290
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,349
Hey, Jesse?

291
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,799
You got....

292
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,039
Yeah.

00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,353
So how you doing?

294
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,278


295
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,192
How's Brock?

296
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,631


297
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,674
Brock, honey, wait in the car, okay?
Let the grown-ups speak.

298
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:19,518
Go on, little man.
We'll catch up later.

299
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:27,035
Guess you know I've been calling.

300
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,753
Yeah.

301
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:31,911
I'm really busy at work and....

302
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,993
Jesse, I'm not here
to make you come up with excuses.

303
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,475
You got other things going on.
I get It.

304
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,472
There's just one thing
you and me gotta talk about.

305
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,237
And that's thls.

306
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,990
After Tomas was murdered,
two dudes...

307
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,555
...bangers he used to hang with,
get run over.

308
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,833
One of them shot in the head.
Same night, | get this in my mailbox.

309
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,752
This was you?

310
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,308
You know what?

311
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,558
Whatever it is you had to do with my
brother's killers, I don't wanna know.

312
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,511
But you gotta tell me one thing...

313
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,593
...ls someone gonna come
looking for this?

314
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,713


315
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,639
What exactly am I supposed to do
with this?

316
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,434
Use it to get you and Brock out
of that shit hole of a neighbourhood.

317
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,034
Or you can go out
and spend It on glass...

318
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,309
...and I'd have no way
of stopping you.

319
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,032
But I gotta believe
you won't do that.

320
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,311
Go home, Walter.

321
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,311
How you doing?

322
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,398


323
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,827
Ton of bricks?

324
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,037


325
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,078
You want me to wheel them inside?

326
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,871
Thank you.

327
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,994
Marie, is that my minerals?

328
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,427
Yes, Hank.

329
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:27,594
How many boxes?

330
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:31,587
I don't know. Three, four hundred.

331
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,677
A million.

332
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:35,034
I don't know.

333
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,070
Did you check them for damage?

334
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,428
Oh, my God.

335
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,669
-They're rocks, Hank.
-No, they're mlnerals.

336
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:45,838
Jesus, Marie. I got some geodes
coming that are very delicate, all right?

337
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,235
I'll not accept any boxes
that have damage.

338
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,194
Those delivery jagoffs, I'm not getting
ass-raped by those bastards.

339
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,798
Just....

340
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,516
Honey, would you check?

341
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,189
Just check, please?

342
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,557
Hey, you, too much wax.

343
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,192
Stop wasting It.

344
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,597
Look, tell your brother
that if he doesn't show up tomorrow...

345
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,359
...l'm gonna have to fire him.
So now, go back.

346
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,311
And no more excuses.

347
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,916
Mr. Wolynetz,

348
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,711
How do you do?

349

-You wanna buy my car wash?
-I do.

350
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,628
And lam prepared to talk numbers
right now, if you'd like.

351
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,114
You think this is an easyjob?

352
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,676
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees...

353
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:50,552
...and scrub like a housemaid...

354
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,876
...wlth all the chemicals
eatlng Into your nice skln...

355
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,559
...and stinging in your eyes?

356
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:59,189
Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubblng.

357
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,597
Any other advice for me?
Because I am serious about this.

358
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,993


359
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,236
I am serious too.

360
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,309
l have worked 30 years on building
this business from nothing...

361
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:13,517
...with my own hands
and my own sweat and blood.

362
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,675
I can appreciate that. Truly.

363
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,913
So with that in mind...

364
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,508
...is there a figure you can quote me?

365
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,278
One which you think would--

366
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,516
Ten million dollars.

367
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,148
Well, let's try 879,000.

368
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,955
Where do you come up with this
number? You pull it from your behind?

369
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,752
On a typical day,
you average 19 cars per hour.

370
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,839
Extrapolating, I added the extra
revenues for hand waxes and detailing.

371
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,950
Subtracted your overhead in salary...

372
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,593
...malntenance,
operatlng fees, depreclatlon...

373
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,872
...which I obtained from businesses
in Albuquerque area...

374
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,311
...giving me an estimate
of your annual cash flow here.

375
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,397
I applied industry-standard multiplier,
added market value of your real estate.

376
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,071
lelng me a total estimated value
of $029,000.

377
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:17,558
On top of which I generously added
an extra $50,000.

378
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,474
So as not to be insulting.

379
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,512
Twenty million dollars.

380
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,832
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this--

381
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,507
This is the price for Walter White.

382
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:34,471
Oh, yes.
You don't think I know who you are?

383
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,748
I remember.

384
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:39,269
-Well, l have not pretended to be a--
-Your husband.

385
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,834
He quit without giving me notice.

386
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:46,597
He broke my air fresheners,
he cursed at me, and grabbed himself.

387
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:48,869
And now he wants
to buy my car wash.

388
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,311
But he's not man enough
to come in here and face me himself.

389
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,555
-lnstead he sends his woman.
-Excuse me.

390
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,273
Walter Whlte wants
to buy my car wash.

391
00:34:57,479 --> 00:35:01,313
The price he pays
Is 20 million dollars.

392
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,475
Now, please leave.

393
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,753
Have you recently lost a loved one
in an aviation disaster?

394
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,037
Have you suffered Injury,
shock to the senses...

395
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,356
...or property damage
as a result of alrpIane debrls...

396
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,834
...or, God forbid, falling body parts?

397
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,109
Then call me, Saul Goodman.

398
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,675
It goes wlthout saylng,
that the slx, seven...

399
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:38,235
...perhaps eight-figure
cash settlement that I can win for you...

400
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:42,114
...will never fill the hole in your heart
caused by your tragic loss.

401
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:44,753
But you deserve justice.

402
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,793
So If you want to tlp the scales
back In your favour...

403
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,309
...better call Saul.

404
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,479
Saul Goodman, attorney-at-Iaw.
505-503-4455.

405
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:56,751
We are just about ready to go....

406
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,075
You might wanna learn
how to tail better...

407
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,033
...If you're planning
on making a habit of It.

408
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,596
May | buy you a drink?

409
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,475
Next round, when you're done.

410
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,832
Why not?
You make a hell of a lot more than I do.

411
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,714
Another round for him,
and I'll have the same.

412
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,353


413
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,950
| feel like I need to explain myself.

414
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,194
There were some actions that I took
which I want you to understand.

415
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,157
I didn't want any of this to happen.

416
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,391
Everything I did,
I did out of loyalty to my partner.

417
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,998
And then, later...

418
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,911
...of course...

419
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,148
I hope you can appreciate that.

420
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,352
Just like I appreciated that....

421
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,394
I appreciate
that when you were going to kill me...

422
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,639
...you were simply following orders.
| get that. Completely.

423
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,678
And | harbour no ill will.

424
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,714
Well, there's a load off my mind.

425
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,957
-Mlke, I'm trying to tell you--
-I get It.

426
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,354
Flne.

427
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,550
Drink up, Walter.

428
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,874
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

429
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,119
Makes a man wonder exactly
where he stands.

430
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,833
I mean, I cannot be alone
In feeling this way.

431
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:29,511
Not after what happened to Victor.

432
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:37,792
So, what's with the piece?

433
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,799
Right hip, inside your waistband.

434
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:45,754
I noticed it the other day at the lab.
You wear it if it makes you feel better.

435
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,952
But If push comes to shove,
It's not gonna help.

436
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,158
Mike, do I have to come right out
and say this?

437
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,072
You and I...

438
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,759
...we're in the same boat.

439
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,108
Drlnk your drink.

440
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,232
If It happened to Victor,
It could happen to you.

441
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,953
And what the hell was that, anyway?

442
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,718
A message?

443
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,878
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

444
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,036
You won, Walter.

445
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,509
You got the job.

446
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,387
Do yourself a favour
and learn to take yes for an answer.

447
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,789
Yeah, I got the job.

448
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:22,478
But for how long?

449
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:29,912
Get me in a room with him.

450
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,515
Mike, just get me in a room...

451
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,110
...and I'll do the rest.

452
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:45,397
You done?

453
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,112
Yeah.

454
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,190
Thanks for the drink.

455
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,394
Plnkman, man,
you know how to party, brother.

456
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,954


457
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,714
Seriously? Where you two going?

458
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,674
Jesse, I've been awake
for, like, three straight days.

459
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,632
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

460
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,033
So crash here.

461
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,150
It's not like I ain't got the space.

462
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,353
Yeah, that's cool and all,
but I think I got, like, this cat.

463
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,188
Think I'm, like, supposed to feed it.

464
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,630
Whatever, you little bitch.
What about you?

465
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,150
You sticking or do I gotta flip you over,
check you for a slizz?

466
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,748
Bro, I'm kind of pushing flowers here,
yo.

467
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,712
I ain't proud of It,
but It's God's honest truth.

468
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,319
Hell, brother,
you know we got mad love for you.

469
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,717
Now that you're back in the mix,
it's, like, nothing but good days ahead.

470
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,037
Plenty of time to pace It out,
Is all I'm saying.

471
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,278
Yeah, man.

472
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,598
Totally.

473
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,233
l was thinking, like, next week?

474
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:42,078
Yeah, sure, man. Next week.

475
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:43,871
We cool?

476
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,075
We are cool.
