00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,468
Hey, man.

00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,591

and fat stacking Benjies.

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,439
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

12
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,072
Hay.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,918
So they got names?

14
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,192

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,197
Him, they call Spooge.

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,399
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Dleael?

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,431
Let me get this straight.

18
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,516

19
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,277
Yo, what's his name matter?

20
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,915
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,634
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thlng....

22
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,909
-Dld I say that?
-Because I'll go do It myself.

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,237

Your funeral, Jack.

38
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,991
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

39
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,872
Yeah, mucho loco.

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,072
Do not test me.

41
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,718
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,559
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,908
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

44
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,587
Looks like It's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,711
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

46
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,878
-You have a great day.
-nght on. You too.

47
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,791
God. Shlt.

48
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,511
Yo, anybody home?

49
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,109
Hello?

50
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,951
Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...

51
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,309
...tonight in the steel knockout.

52
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,317
Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.

53
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,750
That's 15 easy instalments.

54
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,838
And, folks, the knockout is only--

55
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,678
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

56
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,347
Now, Terry put this one together--

57
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,028
Where's your folks? They here?

58
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,070
--and I'm here to tell you--

59
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,228
Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a....

60
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,194
Already done It.

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,436
Tonight, foiks....

62
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,356
Do you realise how long it's been...

63
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,951
...since we've offered this sword
in this set?

64
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:31,234
Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.

65
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,032
it's no wonder--

66
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,197
It is no wonder so many ofyou
are on the line right now--

67
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,469
What's your name?

68
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,831
I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm--

69
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,349
My name's Diesel.

70
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,437
--eieven, 12, 13--

71
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,598
--sixteen, 17, 18, 19....

72
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:53,233
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,910
Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?

74
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,113
imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.

75
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,152
Foiks, custom pieces--

76
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,399
Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...

77
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,749
...but there's a reason for that.

78
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,987
Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.

79
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,669
These knives possess edges Iike....

80
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,232
So when are your folks
coming home?

81
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,638
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,270
I'm hungry.

83
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,158
Hey there, you three.

84
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,033
Just wanted to wish Wait
a good first day back.

85
00:08:56,239 --> 00:09:00,994
We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences....

86
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,192
Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.

87
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,118
Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.

88
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,913
Hi, Wait and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...

89
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,076
...caiiing to say hello.

90
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,271
I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both...

91
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,674
...hoping everything's well.

92
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,838
I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...

93
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,428
...so i'm just hoping
that everything's okay.

94
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,710
Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.

95
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,356
-Hello?
-Oh, hi, Gretchen.

96
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,870
This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

97
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,116
No. No, not at all.

98
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,675
It's so good to hear from you.
How Is everybody?

99
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,199
We're very well, thank you.

100
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,714
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

101
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,117
...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.

102
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,117
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

103
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:55,152
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

104
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,679
That's wonderful.

105
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,510
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

106
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:05,473
...and l have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,829
I mean, he's been so adamant...

108
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,555
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and....

109
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,433
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. ljust--

110
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,836
-What? What Is It?
-I can't...

111
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,395
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,678
The money for Wall's treatment,
it's just....

113
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,351
It saved us.

114
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,230
I don't know If I....

115
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,078
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

116
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,395
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

117
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,909
To me. And to all of us.

118
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
So I Just...

119
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,953
...finally wanted to say thank you.

120
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,713
Anyway...

121
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,235
End of speech.

122
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,999
So I do--
I hope we get to see you soon.

123
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,876
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,718
-How about this afternoon?
-Yeah, okay.

125
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,750
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

126
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,395
...trlenes, polyenes.

127
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,909
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

128
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,076
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

129
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,429
...and you will...

130
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,599
...Just keep |n mind
that one element...

131
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,950
...carbon.

132
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,515
Carbon is at the centre of it all.

133
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,315
There is no life without carbon.

134
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,908
Nowhere that we know of
In the universe.

135
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:53,752
Everything that lives, llved,
will live, carbon.

136
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,474
Carmen is carbon.

137
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,438
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

138
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,516
No. Okay.

139
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,989
lllke to think of It....

140
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,310
I like to think that the diamond...

141
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,475
...and the woman
who wears It on her finger...

142
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,752
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

143
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,669
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,070
That got your attention, right?

145
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,828
The man who Invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,908
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,834
Dr. Hall Invented
the first reproduclble process...

148
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,348
..for making synthetic diamonds.

149
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,630
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

150
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,788
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

151
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:55,515
...electronlcs,
multI-bllllon-dollar Industries.

152
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:59,155
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,115
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,231
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:16,507
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,118
Anyway....

157
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,276
A savIngs bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

158
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,958
...paid to a carbon-based man....

159
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,597
...for something
he made out of carbon.

160
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,151
It's so nice to have you back with us.

161
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,033
You're looking great, by the way.

162
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,552
A little sklnnIer,
which Is definitely no tragedy.

163
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,877
-And then there's the hair thing.
-I actually like that.

164
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,275
That's a great look for you.

165
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,391
-But you're feeling good?
-Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

166
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,669
lt's....

167
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,279
I'm glad to be back at work.

168
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,156
I'm glad to.... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

169
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,270
We're happy too.

170
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,994
And l]ust....

171
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,918

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,908
Peekaboo.

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,235
No?

186
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,392
Peekaboo.

187
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,747
Oh, man.

188
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,711
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

189
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,593
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

190
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,039
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

191
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,993
...I gave you advice,
take It or leave It.

192
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:46,869
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

193
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,229
-Shut up!
-You shut up.

194
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,748
-You shut up, you--
-You shut up!

195
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,554
-You're the one who dropped It.
-I dIdn't drop It.

196
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,714
I didn't drop--

197
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,036
-Shltl You dropped It.

198
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,558

Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

201
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:45,111
-You know who might have done it?
-I have an idea.

202
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,269
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,758
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

204
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,909
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

205
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,273
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,794
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,672
You with me?

208
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,589
Scorplons?

209
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,554
Scorplons are good.

210
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,757
Yeah.

211
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,274


212
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:51,233

214
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,912
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

215
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,155

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,635

226
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:44,395

234
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,553

235
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,751
...but I really need to get going.

236
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,518

00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,316
-I just wanna say, man--

261
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:57,952
I just wanna go on record, man.

262
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,391
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

263
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,795
-Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
-Shut up!

264
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:05,717
Jesus.

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,116
-Serious, I might have a concussion.

266
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,151
-Subdural hematoma.

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,794
Shut up.

268
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,032
All right. Empty your pockets.

269
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,514
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

270
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:19,868
Do It!

271
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,119
All right, turn around.

272
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,514
Turn around.

273
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:30,194
Turn out your back pockets.

274
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,588
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

275

-Shot an ounce In a day and a half?
-Yeah.

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,835
All right, tell you what.

279
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,669
Both of you
pull It out of your butts right now...

280
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:08,667
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

281
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,710
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

282
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:15,717
There you go.

283
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,710
All right, come on.
On the table.

284
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,750
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

285
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:25,948
Division of labour.

286
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,109
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

287
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,310
Where's the rest of my meth?

288
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,829
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

289
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,837
-You shut up.
-You shut up, skank.

290
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,758
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

291
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:44,470
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

292
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,036
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

293
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:51,276
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

294
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,153
...for being such a pussy.

295
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,870
Hey. Hey, baby.

296
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,789
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

297
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,471
All right.

298
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,955
You two are never
getting high agaln.

299
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,627
I will make it my life's mission.

300
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,400
Not another needle,
not another ball...

301
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,479
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mIne.

302
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,556
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

303
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,796
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:32,432
You're damn right, plus interest.

305
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,028
-Where?
-Back yard.

306
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,753
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

307
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,996
-Hurtlng. Painful.
-Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:44,748
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,838
Hey, don't move.

310
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,671
Come on.

311
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,193
See?

312
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,517
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

313
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,439
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

314
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,357
What am I supposed to do with this?

315
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,393
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

316
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,795
Get high.

317
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,432
Yo, that's my bank.

318
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,755
So? lt's FIDC insured, yo.

319
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,349
It's a victimless crime.

320
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,028
Where did you get this?

321
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,435
Bodega. Way across town.

322
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:27,028
In, out, like, barn.
Went smooth as silk, yo.

323
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,398
What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumbass?

324
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,670
We roll like the breeze, for real.

325
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,109
All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.

326
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,470
-Nobody even noticed.
-Nobody noticed?

327
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,151
-For real?
-I'm telling you, victimless crime.

328
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,876
Oh, my God.

329
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,789
Jesus. Come on already.

330
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:01,309
-lt's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
-You don't know what you're doing.

331
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,829
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

332
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,109
Yeah. Boosted.

333
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,196
It's not like he ever got one open.

334
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,118
At least I got persistence.

335
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,073
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

336
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,636
-Don't listen to that skank.
-Stop callIng me that.

337
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,839
I ain't no skankI

338
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,270
-Skank, skank, skank--
-Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,913
Slt, slt.

340
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:28,032
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

341
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,717


342
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,077
You, get that thing open.

343
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:38,272
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

344
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,470
Where's the kid?

345
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,398
The kid. The little kid!

346
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,433
What are you asking me for?

347
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:09,475
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

348
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,873
Didn't see that coming, huh?

349
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,627
What kind of mother are you?

350
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:21,355
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

351
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,994
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,760
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

353
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,359
Are you serious?

354
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,551
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,033
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

356
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,472
Get out of the way.

357
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,189
Get out of the way!

358
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,719
So you didn't tell anyone.

359
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,150
-You dIdn't tell Elllott.
-Not yet.

360
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,435
-Well, what does that mean?
-That means exactly what it means.

361
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,791
That's a determination
l have yet to make.

362
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,557
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

363
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,829
All right.

364
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,113
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

365
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,196
This was....

366
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,075
This entire thing was unfortunate.

367
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,429
Unfortunate?

368
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,796
And I apologise deeply.

369
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,839
Thank you.

370
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,471
Now please tell me why you did it.

371
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,834
That's not really at issue here.

372
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,914
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

373
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:56,036
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

374
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:57,638
...how are you paying for it?

375
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,391
This Is not an Issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

376
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:05,638
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

377
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,433
You tell your wife and son...

378
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,756
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

379
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,474
Why are you doing this?

380
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,952
I will clear this up with them.

381
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,231
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

382
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,998
...thanking me for saving your life.

383
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,113
-Why would you do that to her?
-As I said, I will clear this up.

384
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:31,835
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

385
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,995
All right?

386
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,714
lwIll explain
the whole thing to them.

387
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,275
And while you're at It,
explaln It to me.

388
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,310
I don't owe you an explanation.

389
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,989
I owe you an apology,
and l have apologIsed.

390
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,873
lam very sorry, Gretchen.

391
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,912
There. l've apologised twice now.

392
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,872
I'm humbly sorry.

393
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,478
Three times.

394
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,557
Let me just get this straight.

395
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,034
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

396
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,638
...no strings attached.

397
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,956
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

398
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,719
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

399
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,151
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

400
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,112
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

401
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,231
...you involve us in your lie.

402
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:23,071
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

403
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:28,787
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of It.

404
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,475
What happened to you?

405
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,275
Really, Walt.

406
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,198
What happened?

407
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,072
Because this isn't you.

408
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:49,708
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

409
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,152
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

410
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,590
That I should go begging
for your charity?

411
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,476
And you wavIng
your chequebook around...

412
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,070
...lIke some magic wand
Is gonna make me forget...

413
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,348
...how you and Elliott--

414
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,518
How you and Elliott cut me out?

415
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,438
What? That can't be how you see it.

416
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:13,949
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

417
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,990
That cannot be how you see it.

418
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,031
-Good. That's beautifully done.
-You left--

419
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,957
You are always
the picture of Innocence.

420
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,593
-You left me.
-The picture of Innocence.

421
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,189
-Just sweetness and light.
-You left me.

422
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,188
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

423
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,391
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

424
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,068
...and you're packlng your bags,
barely talklng.

425
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:36,839
What? Did I dream all of that?

426
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,428
That's your excuse...

427
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,312
...to build your little emplre
on my work?

428
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,669
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

429
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:47,791
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

430
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:50,593
thtle rich girl
just addIng to your mllllons.

431
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:58,275
I don't even know what to say to you.

432
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,872
I don't even know where to begin.

433
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,080
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

434
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,993
Fuck you.

435
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:52,990
Hey.

436
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,309
Hey, little man, you hungry?

437
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,039
Hey.

438
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,672
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

439
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,429
No, what are you doing?

440
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,670
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

441
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,471
Baby, get up and help me.

442
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,069
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

443
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,110
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

444
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,874
Bedtlme.

445
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,914
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

446
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:11,238
Who's the bIg tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

447
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:13,236
Is that you? You're the big man?

448
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,999
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

449
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,713
Try and hit me now, bitch.

450
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,388
Oh, hey.

451
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,908
Should I ask where you've been?

452
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,637
Never mInd.

453
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,718
We're long past that, I suppose.

454
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,512
Skyler.

455
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,676
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

456
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,271
Walt.

457
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,315
We need to talk.

458
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,396
Just say It.

459
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:50,552
They're cutting off the money.

460
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,673
What did she say, exactly?

461
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,715
Not much. It was abrupt.

462
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,595
She said something like:

463
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,793
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

464
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,391
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

465
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,558
lwish you the very best."

466
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,434
And that was It.

467
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,393
Yeah.

468
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,112
I mean, she sounded apologetlc.
I guess.

469
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,151
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

470
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:48,748
l was so stunned, but....

471
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:53,669
I called her back
and she dIdn't pIck up.

472
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,428
So, what do you know about this?

473
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:11,868
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

474
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,549
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

475
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:18,910
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

476
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:24,471
Walt.

477
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,076
What do you know that I don't?

478
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,114
Where were you tonight?

479
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,432
I drove up to Santa Fe.

480
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,193
l was with Gretchen.

481
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,517
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

482
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,031
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

483
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:52,992
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

484
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,191
I mean, there was
a lot of hemmlng and hawlng...

485
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,197
...and beating around the bush--

486
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,109
Okay, what--? Tell us what?

487
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:05,471
Well....

488
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,349
There was a lot of...

489
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,874
...buslness phraseology
beIng tossed around.

490
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,393
You know, things like 'cash-poor'
and 'leveraged'...

491
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,477
...'quarterly declIne,'
yadda, yadda, yadda.

492
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,831
But what they were truly saylng,
In my oplnlon....

493
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,079
They're broke.

494
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,513
-You are kidding me.
-No.

495
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:35,952
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

496
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,597
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and....

497
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,360
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

498
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:47,234
...Is no more Immune
than anyone else.

499
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,152
That Is--

500
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,876
Jesus, that's....

501
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,427
Yeah.

502
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:14,109
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

503
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,067
Well, they're prideful people.

504
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,158
Llsten.

505
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:26,715
Not to sound selfish...

506
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,795
...but as far as we go...

507
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:33,309
...we'll get through this, okay?

508
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,995
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

509
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,629
Hey.

510
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,071
We're gonna make It. All right?
I promise.

511
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:52,156
Okay.

512
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,231
And yet...

513
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,397
...she still drives a Bentley.

514
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,319
Keeping up appearances.
