247
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,714
...that whatever he dld to you

248
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,919

249
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,592
...Is that you are my slster.

And so I'm here.

251
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,358
-Marle--
-Everythlng changes now.

252
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,478

You are golng to tell hlm everythlng,
and I mean everythlng.

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,273
-Not a bunch of unll'ormed strangers.

You tell hlm, or I wlll.

268
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,991
There's no way around thls.

269
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,868
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

270
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,793


271
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,600
