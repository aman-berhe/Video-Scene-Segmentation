1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,156
Hore': my resume.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,511
l moan, technlcally It says
'currlculum vltaa'...

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,507
...whlch l thlnk I: more profaulonal,
but, you know...

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,152
...same thing, pretty much.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,077
That's" Wow, grant.

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,112
This position truly is a
no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

7
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:25,391
And it doesn't really say it here...

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,308
...but I havo a solid background
In sales.

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,350
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so....

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,629
-That'e excellent, but--
-Excellent.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,909
ljuet...

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,758
...I really feel I could be a major...

13
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,917
...major asset to your sales force.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,636
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

15
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:47,431
This isn't actually a sales job.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,189
I mean, I'd be happy to consider you
for a sales position...

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,355
...but all our agents
need to be licensed...

18
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,868
...have at least two years
on-the-Job experience...

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,559
...and usually a college degree.

20
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:04,115
What you'll be doing is more like...

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,071
...advertlslng.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,999
Hey, Jesse.

23
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:22,235
Hey, man.

24
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,508
Yo, man.

25
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,516
-What up?
-Badger?

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,075
Where you been keeping yourself?

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,630


28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,478
Yeah, you too.

29
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,271
Thanks.

30
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,198
Yo, why would you wanna do
this lame-ass job, anyway?

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,118
I mean, no offence.

32
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,718
Because I'm on probation, yo.

33
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:44,116
I gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

34
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,231
Upstanding citizen, all that shit.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,079
It's really good exercise too.

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,794
You can't just stand there,
you have to spin the arrow.

37
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,116
There's all these moves
you have to learn, like "the helicopter."

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,276
Yeah. See, yeah?

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,754
That one's a bitch.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,518
I'm not very good at it yet.

41
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,835
You really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

42
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,190
-Yeah.
-Hey, anyways...

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,476
-...thanks for the toke.
-Any time.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,749
Speaking of which...

45
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,116
...you think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,519
No, I've been out of the business
for a while.

47
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,869
Actually, now thinking about retiring.

48
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,990
-What? No.
-Yeah.

49
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,474
That stuff you made is unbelievable.

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,999
It was pretty awesome.

51
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,314
Retirement?

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,719
I can't be hearing this.

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,799
No, man, I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

54
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,274
I mean, I was doing
most of the work...

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,356
...but he was an asshole, so.

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,677
Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by and--

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,474
Yo, I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,318
Major pseudo.

59
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,795
I got channels, bro.

60
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,352
We could partner up.

61
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,594
No pressure.

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,075
No pressure.
Just think about It, all right?

63
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,713
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,235
Yo, this way to savings.

65
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,430
Save your dollar bills, y'all.

66
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,434
Blg savings
This way and save

67
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,674
Come on! Save some money.

68
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,753
It's a stupid glft.

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,439
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,232
I don't know what I was thinking.

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,240
Dldn't the Invitation
even say 'no glfts'?

72
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,078
-Walt.
-What?

73
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,792
We have to go.

74
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,798
I know, I'm not complaining.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,149
Yes, you are.

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,597
Look, we need this.

77
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,871
We've been through a lot
lately. Okay?

78
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,919
Jesus, guess we didn't get
the 'belge' memo.

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,068
We're okay.

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,431
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

81
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,197
Honey, you look fine.

82
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,676
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,435
God, would you look at that.
The invitation said "no gifts."

84
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,869
So? Come on.

85
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,231
Sir, I'll take that for you.

86
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,439
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

87
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:54,998
Oh, look, there's Elliott.

88
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,667
Oh, come on, let's go say hello.

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,473
Elliott.

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,475
Walt.

91
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,750
You made It.

92
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,915
Happy birthday.

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,236
-Wouldn't mlss It for the world.
-Skyler.

94
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,238
HI. Oh, that's right.

95
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,670
Great to see you.
You look beautiful, as always.

96
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,951
Well, these days a little more big
than beautiful, but....

97
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:20,435
Of course, congratulations.
That was such great news.

98
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,110
-Thank you.
-Gretchen, look who's here.

99
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,039
It's been ages.

100
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,913
Oh, it's so good to see you.

101
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,629
It's really good.

102
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,353
Skyler, welcome. Congratulations.

103
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,755
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,394
-When are you due?
-In about 10 more weeks.

105
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,473
And actually, we recently found out
that It's a girl.

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
-0h, that's so wonderful.
-Yeah.

107
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,795
Yeah, we've been thinking about it
for ourselves.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,194
Yeah, thinking about it.

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,154
0h, hey, by the way...

110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,113
...securlng that patent
was Just amazing.

111
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,028
I mean, the work
that your company |s do|ng....

112
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,877
Congratulations to both of you.

113
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,754
-Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot.
-Yeah. Oh, well, now.

114
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,187
Elllott.

115
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,799
Excuse us, we gotta say hi.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,752
Make yourselves at home,
we'll catch up.

117
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,187
Sure, sure. Okay.

118
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,719
-0kay.
-So glad you're here.

119
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,353
-Thank you.
-Bye.

120
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,152
John, Missy. How are you?

121
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,838
Shall we?

122
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,108
Walt?

123
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,798
I thought that was you.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,115
Farley.

125
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,911
Long time no see.

126
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,030
-Thls |s Walter White.
-Hello.

127
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,831
Back at Caltech, he was--

128
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,553
You were Just a master
of crystallography.

129
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,672
I remember this one time we were
stuck on this protein problem...

130
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,517
...for weeks.

131
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,792
...and you had one word for us....

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,719
Synchrotrons.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.

133
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,355
They generate pure and more complete
patterns than x-ray beams.

134
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,472
Data collection
takes a fraction of the time.

135
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,954
This is the White in Gray Matter.

136
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,152
-Tell them, Walt.
-0kay.

137
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,397
Well, back when Elliott and l
were in grad school...

138
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,112
...we came up with the name.

139
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,197
Schwartz, black. Walter White.

140
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,198
So together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

141
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,833
-Cute, huh?
-So you run the company with Elliott?

142
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,678
No. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.

143
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,917
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I gravitated toward education.

144
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,192
What university?

145
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,235
Oh, wow, it's a Stratocaster.

146
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:49,034
Not Just any Strat.
That's one of Clapton's.

147
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:51,036
No way.

148
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,471
"To Elliott, sorry about the buckle rash,
Eric Clapton."

149
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,318
Thank you. This is beautiful.

150
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,271
-Why Is he doing this?
-Beautlful.

151
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,197
What is he, like, 8 years old?

152
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,071
Here, honey.

153
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,428
Thanks.

154
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,755
Oh, this is from Walt.

155
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,517
-0h, God.
-lt's okay.

156
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,639
Hey.

157
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,315
Let's see what we got.

158
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,598
Yum Good Ramen.

159
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,196
This is what Wait and I lived on...

160
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,674
...for 10 months straight...

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,553
...whlle we were working
on our thesis.

162
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,558
Sold them down at Ralstow's
in the hardware isle.

163
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,477
Right next to the-- What was it?

164
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,715
-Sterno. Yeah.
-The Sterno.

165
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,876
Yeah, ten for a dollar ninety-nine.

166
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,913
To this day,
I am convinced these noodles...

167
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,155
...were responsible for our success.

168
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,396
This was our lifeblood.

169
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:05,955
Man, where'd you find these? I thought
they'd been outlawed years ago.

170
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,553
I love It.

171
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,032
Thank you, Walt.

172
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,273
Well.

173
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,311
For the man who has everything.

174
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,508
-No, no, no.
-It was.

175
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,471
-No, you remember the fat guy.
-Yes.

176
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,272
We used to call him Snot Trough.

177
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,992
He had that thing under his nose.

178
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,589
-What do you call that thing?
-That was Dobkins.

179
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,598
That was the same guy
who always smelled like chocolate milk.

180
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,438
-It was.
-No, no, no.

181
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,870
It wasn't Dobkins, it was....

182
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,356
Anyway, I swear to Christ,
he used to iron those patches...

183
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,710
...onto the elbows
of his members-only Jacket...

184
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,274
...because he thought it made him
look distinguished.

185
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,470
-Dldn't It? I thought lt--
-No.

186
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,869
Oh, God.
Well, here's to Snot Trough.

187
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,752
-To Snot Trough.
-Wherever you may be.

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,518


189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,915
Do you remember the professor who
used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

190
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,032
Yes. All you had to do
was mention the Bunsen burner...

191
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,151
...and he was off on a rant.

192
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,271
"Oh, he didn't invent it."
Do you remember the waving?

193
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:11,118
"He just improved it," you know.

194
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,878
It was easy to kill 15 minutes.

195
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,479
Yeah.

196
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,994
Oh, God.

197
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,077
I miss this, Walt.

198
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,747
Yeah. Me too.

199
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,950
Listen, we ought to get together
more often.

200
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,468
Skyler and I would love
to have you and Gretchen...

201
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,238
...over for dinner sometime.

202
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,191
Oh, sure, yeah, absolutely.

203
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,950
But, you know, what I mean is that
you and I should work together again.

204
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,798
-Are you gonna teach high school?
-No, no, no, seriously.

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,150
What's stopping us?

206
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,188
Wait a minute, Elliott,
what are you--?

207
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,993
Are you asking me to come work
for you at Gray Matter?

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,111
Yeah, why not? You'd fit right in.

209
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,437
You're brllllant,
you got a ton of experience.

210
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,153
Well...

211
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:00,236
...I wouldn't really know
where to begin.

212
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,634


213
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,830
God, you have no idea.

214
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,828
I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard...

215
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,758
...and trying to get these kids to learn
the periodic table.

216
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,711
Look, I understand.

217
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,276
You're a little rusty,
but you're not seeing the upside here.

218
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:20,028
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,834
You know when you've
been trying to crack some problem...

220
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,995
...for months on end,
you get tunnel vision.

221
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,830
One guy thinking outside of the box,
you may be exactly what we need.

222
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,751
Well, listen, Elliott, it--

223
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,110
The offer Is very appealing,
It really ls, I thank you.

224
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,549
But there's....

225
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,910
There's something you should know.

226
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,636
l have some personal issues.

227
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,034
Look, there's nothing
we can't work out.

228
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,389
Well, yeah, but...

229
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,068
...lt's complicated.

230
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,358
We can help you.

231
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,154
We have excellent health insurance.

232
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,278
The best.

233
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,748
Hey, did you try those
prosciutto-wrapped flgs?

234
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,790
They were, like, wow.
They were just--

235
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,309
I must have had about 30
of those suckers.

236
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,475
Oh, and the seafood table,
did you see that?

237
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,910
They had lobster tail,
they had crab legs, like, shrimp.

238
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,599
They had....

239
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,476
-Walt.
-What the hell did you say to Elliott?

240
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,432
-What?
-You told him about the cancer...

241
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,359
...didn't you? Didn't you?

242
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,630
I can't believe It.

243
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,275
Okay, we were talking,
he asked how you were doing...

244
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,677
...and lam sorry, but I don't have
the best poker face these days...

245
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,199
...where that's concerned.

246
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,869
He knew something was wrong
with you, and he pressed me.

247
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,513
He pressed you? Come on.

248
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,233
Walt, when it came right down to it...

249
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,715
...I didn't know what to do
but tell him the truth.

250
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:30,514
The truth? Well, how about
you just said, "He's fine," huh?

251
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:35,552
You could have said that. "He's fine."
It would have been done.

252
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,398
I don't like the way you're talking.

253
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,114
I don't like the way you talk
about private affairs...

254
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,154
...to people who are not
even In our lIves anymore.

255
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,668
Well, what exactly did he say to you?

256
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,154
-He offered me a job.
-What?

257
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,716
Yes. Kind of like some flg leaf,
you know.

258
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,229
Some face-saving bullshit...

259
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:57,476
...that allowed me
to generously accept his charity.

260
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,034
And then when I turned that down,
he flat out...

261
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,196
...offered to pay for my treatment.

262
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,357
Which is exactly what
you expected him to do, didn't you?

263
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,835
-Walt.
-Dldn't you?

264
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,588
-No. I did not put him up--
-Please. Come on. Come on.

265
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,069
Okay, what did you say?

266
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,757
Walt?

267
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,077
What do you think I said?

268
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,234
Why? Wait.

269
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,430
-Ready to go?
-l'm taking the bus.

270
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,751
Okay.

271
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,555
Bye, honey.

272
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,519
Hey, dude. Are these bullet holes?

273
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,272
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know...

274
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,436
...ventllatlon.

275
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,427
Cool.

276
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,877
Nlce setup, huh?

277
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,071
-Man.
-Thls Is nothing, man.

278
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,032
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware...

279
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:27,155
...until my dumb-ass ex-partner drove
us into a ditch and wrecked most of it.

280
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,794
Big-ass beaker, huh?

281
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:33,275
Hey, wait, wait, no, that's--
Yeah, that's a boIlIng flask.

282
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,436
This Is a beaker.

283
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:40,110
Here's a Griffin beaker.
Here's a volumetric beaker.

284
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,993
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

285
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,394
You got--

286
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,830
You really know your shit.

287
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,472
It's just basic chemistry, yo.

288
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,837


289
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,916
...you got something for me?

290
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,711
Hells, yeah.

291
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,435
Okay.

292
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,675
We're in business.

293
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:11,868
Right on, Badger.

294
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,275
Dude, check this out.

295
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,068
Jesus.

296
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,589
-What are you bringing that for?
-Huntlng.

297
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,994
We might see javelinas.

298
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,351
Are you gonna help me or what?

299
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,391
Hey.

300
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,953
Badgeﬂ

301
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,476
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

302
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,597
Let's see the money.

303
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,268
Here.

304
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,471
I need flve each.
Come on, two more.

305
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,397
Here.

306
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,439
What about him?

307
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,430
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

308
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:14,833
Whatever.

309
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,279
What about that guy?

310
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,198
No, he looks like a businessman.

311
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,354
So what?

312
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,073
So, businessmen
are always In a hurry.

313
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,397
They're always, like, going
to some meeting or something.

314
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,477
Seriously, he's just gonna say no.

315
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,197
Hey, hey, this guy.

316
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,354
This Is our guy.

317
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,548
You're up.

318
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,477
Why do I have to do it?

319
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,510
Give me the crutches
and I'll go do It.

320
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:41,991
Shlt.

321
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,350
Excuse me, hey...

322
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,629
...we forgot our IDs,
and we were wondering...

323
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,309
...If you could do us a favour
and buy us a six-pack?

324
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,953
You know,
what you're asking Is Illegal.

325
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,554
No, It's not.

326
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,670
Yeah, It Is.

327
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,109
Oh, shit.

328
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,510
Guess you win the jackpot.

329
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,035
This Is not how I wanted to spend
my night off.

330
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,227
Consider this your first
and last warning.

331
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,318
-Yes, sir.
-You're lucky you got a good dad, here.

332
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,036
The other guys had to run.

333
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,912
I couldn't talk my way out of it.

334
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,155
Not cool, man. Not cool.

335
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,716
What, you never tried to buy beer
when you were my age?

336
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,673
I'm talking about you calling me
and not your father.

337
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,991
How do you think
that'd make him feel?

338
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,274
I don't even know what to say to you.

339
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,590
Just go.

340
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,869
l'll deal with you later.

341
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,513
Where's Walt?

342
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,436
I haven't seen him since this morning.
Your guess is as good as mine.

343
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:13,915
Listen, do me a favour, all right?

344
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,916
Don't tell him about the kid.

345
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,917
He's just a teenager
trying to score some beer.

346
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,278
You know...

347
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,193
...growlng palns.

348
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,516
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

349
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,280
First the pot, then this.

350
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,833
The pot?

351
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,916
-You told me the kid was smoking.
-That's what Skyler told me.

352
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,192
-I mean, you may as well have.
-I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.

353
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:45,072
l was talking about Walt.

354
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,114
Excuse me?

355
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,549
He admitted it.

356
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,834
He said he liked it.

357
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,038
Walt?

358
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,676
Shlt.

359
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,395
I didn't think he had it in him.

360
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,591
-lt's like he's not himself lately.
-Yeah.

361
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,834


362
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,270
...why would anyone in their right mind
choose not to do treatment?

363
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,994
Especially when
It's completely paId for.

364
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,991
Why is he doing this?

365
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,032
You know what we need to do?

366
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:26,072
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us...

367
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,396
...and get everything out
on the table.

368
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,917
-You mean an Intervention?
-No, no.

369
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,350
Just a family meeting.

370
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,551
Where everyone
can voIce their concerns...

371
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,989
...and be heard.

372
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,670
You are a genius, bro.

373
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:54,756
This cankenstein is unreal.

374
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,996
When we get back,
I'm gonna burn that suit...

375
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:00,271
...because we're gonna
make some mad dough.

376
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,077
It's not right.

377
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,712
What do you mean,
It's not right?

378
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,835
It's cloudy.
It's not supposed to be cloudy.

379
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,633
Okay, that last time, it was glass.

380
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,550
So what? Cloudy, not cloudy?
It looks good enough to me.

381
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,231


382
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,231
Walt, walt.
Yo, what are you doIng?

383
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,999
Are you out of your mind?
I totally would've smoked that.

384
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:36,235
It's not for you,
It's for our customers.

385
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,271
They're gonna demand
a certain standard.

386
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,278
What? What--? What are you--?

387
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,834
-What?
-We'll just do It agaln.

388
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,874
Until we get it right.

389
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,511
Walt.

390
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,713
Please have a seat and join us.

391
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,598
-We can do better.
-Don't you fucking think about it.

392
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,519
-Hey.
-Come on.

393
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,718
Three entire pounds
of pseudo wasted.

394
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:16,955
Do you know how long
I had to spIn that sIgn?

395
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,869
-Get off me, psycho.
-Hellcopter, bltchl

396
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,277


397
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,275
Asshole.

398
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,029
Open the door.

399
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,757
Come back here, you bitch!

400
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,392
I'm gonna mess you up!

401
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,871
This Isn't funnyl

402
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,956
I really need to understand
your thought process...

403
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,957
...because clearly I don't.

404
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,755
I feel that this decision
you've made...

405
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,236
...lt's not In the best Interest
of our entire family.

406
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,037
-Look, Skyler--
-Not yet, please. l--

407
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,153
l have the talking pillow.

408
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,155
Everybody gets to speak their minds,
remember?

409
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,874
And then you'll get your chance.

410
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,870
Money has always been
an issue for us, I'll give you that.

411
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,072
But now that Elliott is more than willing
to pitch in--

412
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,397
Wait, I know, I understand
that it's hard for you to accept help.

413
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,556
Maybe it's the way you were raised.

414
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,556
But, honey...

415
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,513
...lt's okay to lean on people
now and again.

416
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,870
You need this treatment.

417
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,833
And nothing can stop you
from getting It...

418
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,632
...except you.

419
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,230
-Am I allowed to respond?
-In a minute.

420
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,194
I think we need
to go around the cIrcle first.

421
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,109
Hank, would you like to start?

422
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,030
Yeah. Okay, well....

423
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:40,434
-What I would say Is--
-Take the talking plllow.

424
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,110
All right, look, buddy...

425
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,958
...I know I don't get to
tell you this enough...

426
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,590
...but I care about you.

427
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,230
A hell of a lot.

428
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:02,637
And this cancer thing....

429
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,107
Let's just-- Let's face it, you know,
you were dealt a shit hand.

430
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,117
But...

431
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,117
...sometimes your luck can change.

432
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,355


433
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,074
I mean, I can't tell you how many times
lwas-- I started with a shit hand...

434
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,794
...and I ended up with a, you know,
a full house. Okay?

435
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,236
I mean, the key ls,
you gotta hang In there.

436
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:26,318
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets,
keep placing your bets.

437
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,433


438
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:32,472
-...what the hell are you saying?
-Please, Marie, let him talk.

439
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,671
That's what we're here to do. Please.

440
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,311


441
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:43,192
All right, look at it this way, okay?

442
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,232
It's the bottom of the ninth,
bases are loaded...

443
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,919
...you're up.

444
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,714
But you got a bum arm, right?

445
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,992
There's no fricking way
you're gonna hit a homer, okay?

446
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:57,714
So you can either let the pinch hitter
take the bat...

447
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,707
...or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

448
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,957
You get what I'm saying?

449
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,916


450
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,674
You got your pride, man.
I get It, okay? I get It.

451
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,515
But this Daddy Warbucks
wants to chip in, man.

452
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,759
I'm with your old lady on this one.
I say take the money and run, man.

453
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,951
Somebody wanna take this thing?
Here.

454
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,433
Yes, Waiter--

455
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,158
Walter, Jr., I'm sure that you have
about a million things to say, probably.

456
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,715
And now is your chance.

457
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,990
Go ahead. Just let it all out.

458
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,555
This Is bullshit.

459
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,511
-All right, come on.
-lt's all right.

460
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:45,517
lt--

461
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,997
Talk.

462
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,588
Tell your dad how you feel.

463
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:58,072
-l'm pissed off.
-Tell him.

464
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,314
I'm pissed off.

465
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,987
Because you're being....

466
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:05,867
You're--

467
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,432
You're a pussy.

468
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,557
You're, like, ready to give up.

469
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:20,075
You're-- God.

470
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,634
What if you gave up on me, huh?

471
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:30,111
This here...

472
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,558
...and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

473
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,988
Me, personally...

474
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,349
...I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

475
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,672
What?

476
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,754
You told us to be honest
about our feelings.

477
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,996
Walt's the one with cancer,
It's his decision.

478
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,076
It's not up to any of us.

479
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:12,557
-Why In hell would you do this?
-Hey, hey.

480
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,751
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

481
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,872
After sitting and listening
to you all talk about his future...

482
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,311
-...llke he has no say In lt--
-He's not gonna have a future...

483
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,111
...if he doesn't get treatment.

484
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,198
lam a medical professional.

485
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:31,153
l x-ray people In treatment
every day.

486
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,749
I see them every day.
And you know what?

487
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,555
Some of them
are absolutely mIserable.

488
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,273
-Marle--
-l'm sorry, but It's true.

489
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,917
And some of them don't wanna spend
their last weeks or months...

490
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,474
...being picked at by doctors.

491
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,988
But they got talked Into It
by their families.

492
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:52,235
Can I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie.

493
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,395
-Thank you.
-Hank--

494
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,670
What? Maybe Walt wants to die
like a man.

495
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:58,188
I don't want him to die at all.

496
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,516
That's the whole point of this.
So either help or leave.

497
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,679
Skyler, ljust wanted
to do you the courtesy...

498
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:07,029
...of giving you my honest opinion.

499
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:10,709
You know, Marle,
this Is not debate club.

500
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:16,039
-This is my husband's life--
-I made one simple observation--

501
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:19,629
-And it's like you-- How dare you--
-Okay, so we disagree--

502
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,751
Ladlesl Marlel

503
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,269
This Is so stupid.

504
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:32,595
All right,
I've got the talking plllow now.

505
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:35,148
Okay?

506
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:48,317
We all, In this room...

507
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,676
...we love each other.

508
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,435
We want what's best for each other,
and I know that.

509
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,229
lam very thankful for that.

510
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,836
But what I want--

511
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,471
What I want, what I need...

512
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,269


513
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,754
What does that mean?

514
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,355
Sometimes I feel like I never
actually...

515
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,029
...make any of my own choices...

516
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,912


517
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,073
My entire life...

518
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,670
...It just seems I never...

519
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,798
...you know, had a real say
about any of It.

520
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,830
Now, this last one, cancer...

521
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,639
...all I have left Is
how I choose to approach this.

522
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,673
Then make the right choice, Walt.

523
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:04,277
You are not the only one it affects.

524
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,797
What about your son?

525
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:12,438
Don't you wanna see your daughter
grow up? I just....

526
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,231
Of course I do.

527
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,511
Skyler, you've read the statistics,
you....

528
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,038
These doctors...

529
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,072
...talking about "surviving"...

530
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:39,591
...one year, two years,
like it's the only thing that matters.

531
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:46,511
But what good is it to just survive
if I am too sick to work?

532
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,027
To enjoy a meal?

533
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,791
To make love?

534
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:03,158
For what time I have left...

535
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,510
...I wanna live in my own house.

536
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,392
I wanna sleep in my own bed.

537
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,990
I don't wanna choke down
30 or 40 pills every single day...

538
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,348
...and lose my hair...

539
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,072
...and lie around,
too tired to get up...

540
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,994
...and so nauseated
that I can't even move my head.

541
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,717
And you.

542
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,469
Cleaning up after me.

543
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,551
And me? What--?

544
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,111


545
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:43,790
Some dead man,
some artlflclally-allve--

546
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,557
Just marking tlme.

547
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,110


548
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:57,477
And that's
how you would remember me.

549
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,510
That's the worst part.

550
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,157
So that Is my thought process,
Skyler.

551
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,313
I'm sorry. ljust....

552
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,517
I choose not to do it.

553
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,991
All right.

554
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,190
'All right' what?

555
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,674
I'll do the treatment.

556
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,630
It's gonna be okay.

557
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,871
Okay.

558
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:28,037
The lady from the billing office...

559
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,037
...said they usually bill
the insurance company directly.

560
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:36,188
But since our HMO's not paying for it,
we can pay up front with a credit card.

561
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,197


562
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,077
Oh, and then Elliott
will send a cheque.

563
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,874
I will take care of it.

564
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,351
Walter White?

565
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,558
Yes.

566
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,396
Okay.

567
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,153
-All right.
-Okay.

568
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,588
-See you In a minute.
-Okay.

569
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,994
Okay.

570
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,793
Elllott.

571
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,275
Wait, it's Gretchen.

572
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,033
Oh, hey.

573
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,832
Hey, Gretchen, how are you?

574
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,715
You know, it was really great seeing
you two the other day, you know.

575
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,354
Wow, what a party.

576
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:49,509
Elliott told me about the cancer.

577
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,871
I'm so sorry.

578
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,709
Well, you know...

579
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,436
...It Is what It ls, I guess.

580
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,631
I don't know what to say.

581
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,718
Except, I'm always here for you.

582
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,596
Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.

583
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,388
Yeah, well, thank you.

584
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:17,469
Walt, Elliott told me that he'd offered
to pay for the treatment.

585
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,714
You have to accept.

586
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,956
That money,
as far as we're both concerned...

587
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,310
...that belongs to you.

588
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,910
Even the name of our company,
It's half yours.

589
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:30,434
Wait?

590
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,238
Is this about you and me?

591
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,234
Gretchen, I really appreciate
the offer.

592
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:53,795
I do. But we're fine.

593
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,230
As it turns out,
the insurance came through after all.

594
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:00,236


595
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:03,715
...I am covered. And....

596
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,719
We", and, anyway,
i really appreciate it, i really do.

Good. That's good news.

599
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:16,357
You know,
