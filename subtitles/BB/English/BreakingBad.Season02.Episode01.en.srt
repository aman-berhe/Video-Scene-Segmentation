1
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,869
What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,758
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

3
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,918
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,151
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,995
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:19,556
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:23,357
Just remember
who you're working for.

8
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:27,671
What did you say?

9
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,553
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

10
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,230
Like they don't already know that?

11
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,953
Are you saying that they're stupid?

12
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,154
No, I'm Just saying.

13
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,873
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

14
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,593
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

15
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,152
Is that It?

16
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,270
Is that what you're doing?

17
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,516
Tuco. Tuco.

18
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,759
Hey, why don't we all
Just relax, huh?

19
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,549
Heisenberg says relax.

20
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,350
l'm relaxed. l'm relaxed. l'm rela--

21
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,553
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,674
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:37,151
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,109
Adjusting for inflation....

25
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,914
Good state college,
adjusting for Inflation...

26
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,553
...say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,470
Two klds, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,514
Remalnlng mortgage on the home,
107,000.

29
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,633
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,469
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utllltles...

31
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,672
...say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,235
I mean, that should put a dent In It,
anyway.

33
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,037
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,519
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,469
Seven thirty-seven.

36
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,439
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,835
That is what I need.

38
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,279
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,198
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call It 11.

40
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:31,711
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,870
lt's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,234
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,308
Helsenbergl

44
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,827
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,236
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,032
-0h, damn, Tuco.
-Shut up!

48
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,396
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,954
-Do something.
-Do something?

50
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,389
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,874
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,353
Do that-- Do that thing.

53
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,597
No, there's not-- There's nothing.

54
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,153
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,555
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,274
You, come here.
Breathe Into his mouth.

57
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,751


58
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,674
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,915
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,838
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,554
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,558
That sounds like arguing.

63
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,316
Gonzo, hurry up.

64
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,195
What's the big hurry?

65
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,473
Oh, l.... I just think we're done here.

66
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,476
Oh, yeah?

67
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,470
You're done.

68
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,754
Hey, I'm back here.

69
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,476
Hello?

70
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,274
Are already married--

71
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,832
Hello?

72
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,670
Thank you to our viewers--

73
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,711
Hey.

74
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:09,595
The crash happened
as rush hour began around 8 am.

75
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,352
Walt?

76
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,508
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,429
Walt.

78
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,477
Walt.

79
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,708
-Hey.
-Hey yourself.

80
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:31,069
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,677
Are you okay?

82
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,952
Great.

83
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,274
New hat?

84
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,112
Yeah.

85
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,952
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,911
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

87
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,829
But they can occasionally adapt
to other local areas...

88
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,396
...Iike airports, golf courses--

89
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,915
Where've you been?

90
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,517
What ls...?

91
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,388
What are you doing?

92
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,557
Okay.

93
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,749
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

94
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,870
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,914
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so....

96
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,918
Okay. Yeah, just....

97
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,475
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,635
Hold up. Stop It.

99
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,874
Stop It!

100
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:09,428
I know you're scared...

101
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,716
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

102
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:20,509
But you cannot take it out on me.

103
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,029
Hey, I'm home.

104
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,354
Oh, we are dead.

105
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,915


106
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,587
Ruto or rule
or however the hell you--

107
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,552
-Thls Is conjecture.
-Thls Is conjecture?

108
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,591
-Conjecture Isn't helplng.
-Conjecture--?

109
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,997
-We need to state the facts.
-Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,192
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,071
Second fact:
lee 3 In the morning...

112
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,509
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

113
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,075
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

114
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,713
What is that, conjecture?

115
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,389
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

116
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:16,831
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

117
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,758
And that way--
That way he just kept staring at us...

118
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,395
...saylng, 'You're done.'

119
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,555
'You're done'?

120
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,274
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

121
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:30,232
That means
exactly how It sounds, yo.

122
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,908
All right. We are wltnesses.
We are loose ends.

123
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,235
Right now, Tuco's thlnklng,
'Yeah, hey...

124
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,718
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?‘

125
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,951
What happens
when he decIdes 'no'?

126
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,588


127
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,439
It Is him or us. You understand?
It Is him or us!

128
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,075
-How would you do It?
-What do you mean, how?

129
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,635
Speclflcally, how would you do It?
Step by step.

130
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,676
All right.

131
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:20,552
Say we set up one last sale.

132
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,831
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

133
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,111
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,472
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,389
So three shots?

136
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,156
-Three shots or, I don't know, two.
-Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,635
-Two would probably work, I guess.
-Okay, two shots.

138
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,239
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,750
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

140
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,396
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin In that.

141
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,556
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

142
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,715
-...he's probably coming at you, right?
-Yeah.

143
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:56,989
-You turn toward him.
-Yeah, just wheel on him--

144
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,952
How many shots for him?
He's a bIg guy.

145
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,479
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,397
-I don't know. Three shots.
-Three shots.

147
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,272
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,992
Now, is there anyone else there?

149
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,192
I mean, Tuco Is usually
with someone else, rlght?

150
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,837
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

151
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,272
All right.

152
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,630
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

153
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,716
At this point, how many shots fired?

154
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,798
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

155
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,476
It's not--

156
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,513
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

157
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,234
...and you can't even open the gun?

158
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:57,436
-lt's not that easy, Is It?
-Hey, man, Walt, you dId It.

159
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,110
Yeah.

160
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:18,390
Call Skyler.

161
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:28,757
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.

162
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,315
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

163
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,794
Well, aren't you early bIrd,

I'm still hlp.

170
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,108
lt's Chinese. The restaurant.

171
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,072
I don't know,
ljust feel like Chlnese.

172
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,228
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

173
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:05,229
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

174
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
...wlth mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

175
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,716
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

176
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,308
I wonder if that ever happens.

177
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,909
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

178
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,276
Skyler didn't pick up?

179
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,547
Obviously she's not home.

180
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,235
Baby. Baby, wait up.

181
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,635
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

182
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,717
Dinner tonight. That new place.

183
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,548
-How late they serve?
-I don't know.

184
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,557
You got Dave at 0.

185
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,599
-Not tonlght.
-Yeah, you do. Remember?

186
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,313
No, that's Thursday.

187
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,796
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

188
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:59,194
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

189
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:01,913
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

190
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,110
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

191
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,389
And I'm doing them, Hank.

192
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,398
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

193
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,672
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

194
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,949
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

195
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,077
Look, it's.... You know, it's just....

196
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,872
Oh, boy. I....

197
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,108
I think Dave is really helping you.

198
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,557
Yeah.

199
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,389
Yeah.

200
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,069
Sorry about that.

201
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,510


202
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:12,115
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

203
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,638
Hlts two In the sand,
two In the forest...

204
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,274
-...and then he says, 'lee me a four.‘
-Hey, Gomez.

205
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,914
Gomez? What do you got for me?

206
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:24,030
Come on. Chop-chop.

207
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,548
Good morning to you too.

208
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,111
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

209
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,153
-You know Southwest Aniline, right?
-Yeah, off the 25?

210
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,509
The place smells like feet.

211
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,870
This is them. Check this out.

212
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:46,470
-Holy shit. What was that?
-Thermite. So they tell me.

213
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,351
Burns about 5000 degrees.

214
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,471
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

215
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,195
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

216
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,237
Wait. I take that back.

217
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,068
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

218
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,874
Hey, try rolllng It, morons.
It's a barrel.

219
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,798
It rolls. Jesus.

220
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,747
-So, what'd they get?
-Methylamlne, 30 gallons.

221
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,991
P2P?

222
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:19,952
They're cooklng
old school blker meth.

223
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,747
Who the hell still does that?

224
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:24,632
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

225
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,271
Pseudo's in short supply...

226
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,870
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

227
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,547
That and the thermite...

228
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,829
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

229
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,600
-But ranking them as burglars?
-Shlt.

230
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,519
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

231
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,837
They got book learning
but no street skllls.

232
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,359
Maybe they're college kids.

233
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,312
Chem students
trying to make a bIg score.

234
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,635
Yeah, maybe.

235
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,307
ltell you, 30 gallons of precursor....

236
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,477
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

237
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,992
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

238
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,839
...and not those boys from Juarez.

239
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,592
Your daughter wants out.

240
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,997
Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.

241
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,714
We can't come to the phone,
so please leave us a message.

242
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,074
Hey, It's me.

243
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,713
Thought I'd try you earlier...

244
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,390
...before you go out
and, you know, face the day.

245
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,794
I'm reaIIsIng now...

246
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:15,877
...it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone...

247
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,230
...owing to the extra baby weight--

248
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,712
Hey, sweetIe.

249
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,873
Walt, dId you spend
the entire night out here?

250
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:33,517


251
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,790
No, no. Well, not all of it.

252
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,476
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of--
My stomach, you know.

253
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,514
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

254
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,758
-How would he know where I live?
-You sure it was Tuco?

255
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:16,994
Who else could it be?

256
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,156
-Dld you ever tell him my name?
-No.

257
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,237
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

258
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,236
-No.
-What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

259
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,510
-Dld you tell them anything?
-I dIdn't say jack.

260
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,110
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

261
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,279
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

262
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,430
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

263
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,516
Oh, God. What happens then?

264
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:51,515
Look, it's got five bullets.

265
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:55,951
I finally figured out how to....
Look, I just finally-- I figured it out.

266
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,627
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

267
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,594
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

268
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,471
I mean, mathematically.

269
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,709
I've got a better idea.

270
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:11,675
Thank God.

271
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:13,198
All right.

272
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:15,629
What Is It, Mr. White?
Lay It on me.

273
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:20,757
-Beans.
-Beans?

274
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,153
They're castor beans.

275
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,918
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

276
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,468
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

277
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,193
Climb it and escape?

278
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,708
We are going to process them
Into rIcln.

279
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,438
Rice and beans?

280
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:42,392
Rlcln.
It's an extremely effective polson.

281
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,791
lt's toxic in small doses.

282
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:47,354
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

283
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:50,235
All right.

284
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,113
-All right. So--
-Don't touch them.

285
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,272
-You can get polsoned from beans?
-Yes.

286
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,792
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

287
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,476
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

288
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,671
...to Inject a tiny pellet
Into the man's leg.

289
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,155
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

290
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,589
But it-- It killed him?

291
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,631
Oh, yes.

292
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,120
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery devlce...

293
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,075
...and then no more Tuco.

294
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,910
-Hey, Sky.
-Hey, Hank.

295
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,072
How you doing?

296
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:13,112
Is this.... This a bad time?

297
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,630


298
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,955
lshould've called first. I'm sorry.

299
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,711
What can I do for you?

300
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,591
Maybe we ought--

301
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,676
You wanna sit down first?

302
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,355
I don't know, Hank.

303
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:44,596
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

304
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,508
-Dld she send you?
-Hell, no.

305
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,188
She's barely even talking to me.

306
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,151
That's why I'm here, okay?

307
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,273
Self-preservation. Big time.

308
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,998
Look...

309
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,675
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

310
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:09,278
-I get It.
-Gals.

311
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,631
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

312
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,634
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

313
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,398
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

314
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,309
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

315
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,795
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

316
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:32,194
Just call her back.

317
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:39,835
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

318
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,998
That's right.

319
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,956
That baby tlara
she gave me at the shower?

320
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,276
She stole It
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

321
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,677
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

322
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:58,157
And Marie won't admit It.
She won't apologIse.

323
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,148
Yeah.

324
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,559
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know....

325
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,595
You knew about this.

326
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,989
We're working on it.

327
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:20,157
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

328
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,158
-And I mean, Dave is really good.
-Dave's good, yeah.

329
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,874
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

330
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,594
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

331
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,198
I mean, we gotta, you know.

332
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,914
We gotta support the shit out of her.

333
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,788
Do we?

334
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,318
Yeah.

335
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,352
I need support.

336
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,233


337
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,351
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

338
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:49,277
...with the surprise baby on the way.

339
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,557
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

340
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,398
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

341
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,477
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

342
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,554
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

343
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,431
And the overdrawn
checking account.

344
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,029
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

345
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:07,833
...and Is rottlng out the floor
of the utility closet...

346
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,076
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

347
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,112
But, oh, I see.

348
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,834
Now I'm supposed to go,
'Hank, please...

349
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,428
...what can I possIbly do
to further beneflt...

350
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:21,278
...my spoIled, kleptomanlac,
bltch slster...

351
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,278
...who somehow always manages
to be the centre of attention?"

352
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,191
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

353
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,997
Want me to take a look
at that utlllty closet?

354
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,672
That's all it takes?

355
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,274
That's all it takes.

356
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,833
So now what?

357
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:31,039
Now we arrange our next meet.

358
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,469
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

359
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,635
Business as usual.

360
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,354
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

361
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,589
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

362
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,869
Care to try It?'

363
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,752
Okay, well, what's new about it?

364
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,990
I mean, just In case he asks.
What do we say?

365
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,678
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

366
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:58,232
It gets the user insanely high.

367
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,748
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

368
00:35:00,959 --> 00:35:04,269
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

369
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,516
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin In that, then.

370
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:13,638
Anyway, within the next 40 hours,
maybe 72...

371
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,307
...it'll look like natural causes.

372
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,398
-What, like a heart attack?
-Yeah.

373
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,431
Or the flu, maybe.

374
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
HIs assoclates won't know
any differently...

375
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,310
...and we'll be in the clear.

376
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:31,352
Not if Tuco kills us first.

377
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:49,955
Just keep It down.

378
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,195
Hey, Hank. What's up?

379
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,913
Oh, hey, buddy.

380
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,708
You been home yet?

381
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,429
No. Why?

382
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,913
Well...

383
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,359
Because I really screwed up.

384
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,517
I apologise in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.

385
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,358
I was trying to get her and Marie
talking again. Big mistake.

386
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,588
-I should have just kept out of It.
-Yeah, well, okay.

387
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:19,312
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

388
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,035
Yeah, well, that-- You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

389
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,707
Yeah, well, thanks, man.
I appreclate that.

390
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,709
Jesus, the wives, huh?

391
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,195
Hank, unfortunately, I really--

392
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,756
Oh, yeah.
Hey, man, don't let me keep you.

393
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:39,589
Actually, I'm at work, so.... Oh, hey.

394
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,438
You wanna see something
really freaky?

395
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,791
-Well, I would, but--
-SerIoust, Walt, thls Is....

396
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:49,918
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

397
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:55,034
Hank.

398
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,275
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

399
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,508
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

400
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,031
Couple of local bulletheads.

401
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,072
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

402
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,477
Walt, you there?

403
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,152
Hey, Walt?

404
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,680
-l'm taking this.
-No. It's my gun. I need It!

405
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:29,347
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

406
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,552
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. We...

407
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:35,990
I've gotta get home. My family.

408
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,390
Skyler?

409
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,110
Walter, Jr.?

410
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,110
Skyler?

411
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,077
Hey.

412
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,117
Where's Walter, Jr.?

413
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,834
Havlng dinner at Louls' house.
Supposedly.

414
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,198
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

415
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,192
So where have you been
this time?

416
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,196
Walt?

417
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,717
Walt?

418
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,313
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

419
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,157
Walt!

420
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,635
I'll be right there.

421
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,470
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

422
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,988
Known associates
of a psychotic pIece of shit...

423
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,393
...named Tuco Salamanca.

424
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,034
-Guess he got tIred of associating.
-Yeah.

425
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,753
-Hey, do you mind If I get In there?
-No, go ahead.

426
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,109
Thanks.

427
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,549
The big one smells fresher.

428
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:05,633
You guys find a death wound?

429
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:13,150
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

430
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,952
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

431
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,633
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

432
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,875
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

433
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,079


434
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:38,998
Damn, Rlcky.
Leave something for the coroner.

435
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,555
Oh, this Is beautlful.

436
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,430
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

437
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,278
We got the world's
dumbest crImlnal.

438
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,788
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

439
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:01,787
BIg stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

440
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:05,196
...when the stack must have shifted.

441
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:09,631
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

442
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,231
-Poet|c justlce. Oh, I love It.
-Don't you just?

443
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:16,475
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

444
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,796
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

445
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,432
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

446
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,314
I don't know where to begin.

447
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:33,272
What the hell are you doing here?

448
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,149
Get In.

449
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,673
Get In.

450
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,917
Let's go.
