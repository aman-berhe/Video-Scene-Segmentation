1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,397
Operation Icebreaker.

2
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:12,393
-How we liking that?
-We never used that before, did we?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,636
-lan't that the name of a breath mlnt?
-What?

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,797
-|ce Breakers, right? Breath mint?
-Nobody's gonna think that.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,753
Gonna be thinking about some ship
in the North Pole breaking ice.

6
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,712
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
Operation Breath Mint.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,549
I'm thinking Operation Breath Mint every
time you and me are on a stakeout.

8
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:30,227
Your breath can knock a buzzard
off a shit waggon.

9
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,637
All right, Operation TBD.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,909
Thanks for nothing, Gom.

11
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,267
Anyway, say hello to
Domingo Gallardo Molina.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,075
A.k.a. Krazy-8. Way smarter
than your average cheese eater.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,716
I turned him out when he was street,
but this dude's like The Jeffersons...

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,229
-...movlng on up.
-Every dealer he'd throw at us...

15
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:54,227
-...he'd end up snaking their customers.
-Turns out he's missing, presumed dead.

16
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,555
Found his car out in the boonies.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,673
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin...

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,518
...Em|l|o Koyama.

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,028
You thinking the cousin found out
and took revenge?

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,754
Could be, turns out he's missing too.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,157
And normally I'd say
someone did the world a favour.

22
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,068
But our snitch's car, turns out
we find two grams of meth in it...

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,191
...we take It to the lab,
they come back...

24
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:20,038
...they tell us It the purest
they've ever seen.

25
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,797
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

26
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,433
Our chemist is blown away.
Said he couldn't do better.

27
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:27,517
Worse yet, it didn't come out
of some super lab in Mexico...

28
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,711
...we're thinking this was cooked
here in the Land of Enchantment.

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,230
Car was abandoned
at what appears to be a cook site.

30
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,794
This Is the only other thing
left behind.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,310
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,310
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

33
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,834
So be on notice.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,195
We got new players in town.

35
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:55,355
Now, we don't know who they are,
or where they come from...

36
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,868
...but they possess
an extremely high skill set.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,152
Me, personally...

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,395
...I'm thinking Albuquerque
just might have a new kingpin.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,394
Jesus, Walt,
you're burning the shit out of them.

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,393
Damn It.

41
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,909
Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,997
Emerll, here,
Is gonna need a fresh pack.

43
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,273
All right, looking good.

44
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,073
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
In the coleslaw?

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,194
I don't know, it's store-bought.

46
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,073
Okay, Hank, you need another beer?

47
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,792
Does the pope shit in his hat?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,549
Yeah, I don't think that he does, Hank,
and I think everybody would like it...

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,079
...if you'd stop saying that.

50
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,395
-Marle, some more wine?
-l'm all right, thanks.

51
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,272
-All right.
-Hey, I want a beer.

52
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,437
Yeah, I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggy.

53
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,436
Guess what. It ain't happening either.

54
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,630
-How about some more soda?
-Yeah, sure.

55
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,716
Honey, do you need anything?

56
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,389
-No, Walt, thank you.
-0kay. Be right back.

57
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,838
-No.
-What, are you kidding me?

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,190
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,789
Girls gotta be lining up left and right.

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,715
-Tell him how good-looking he is.
-He's adorable.

61
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,558
He doesn't wanna be fricking adorable,
he wants to be hot.

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,194
See what I'm talking about?
That's female perspective.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,188
-She's supposed to say that.
-Look, a guy doesn't gotta look like...

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,437
...you know, Charlton Heston--
I'm talking Moses days.

65
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,075
--to get a girl, all right?
You Just gotta have...

66
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,398
...confldence.

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,114
Confidence and persistence.

68
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,470
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

69
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,874
I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

70
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,637
What, I asked you, like, 50 times?

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,515
Yeah, it was before they tightened
the stalking laws.

72
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:33,312
Anyway, how about your dad here?
That there's a good story, Walt.

73
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,035
-Tell him how you met Skylar.
-Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos...

74
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:41,754
...and Dad said that thing to you.

75
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,952
Well, actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress...

76
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,152
...It was a summer Job,
and she was the hostess...

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,828
...and she also worked
the cash register.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,555
And I used to go in there a lot because
it was close enough to the lab...

79
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,432
...where I could ride my bicycle.

80
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,032
And once I noticed her...

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,395
...it got to be so that I would only go in
when I knew she was working.

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,558
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter...

83
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,992
...dolng her crossword puzzles,
but kind of hiding It...

84
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,269
...pretendlng that
she was still working...

85
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,515
...and once I caught on to that...

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,429
...I would do crossword puzzles while
late my grilled-cheese sandwich.

87
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
It got so that every day at lunch...

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,517
...we would both be doing
The New York Times crossword puzzle...

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,188
...10 feet from each other.

90
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,431
And eventually...

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,673
...I caught her looking over at me...

92
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,631
...so I began saylng:

93
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,437
"Excuse me, 14 across,
seven-letter word for whatchamacallit...

94
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,949
...may I ask what you wrote down?"

95
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,152
And, well, that got us talking...

96
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,512
...and, boy, I tell you,
I was terrible at those puzzles.

97
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,275
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

98
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,517
But your mother
would do them In Ink.

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,789
Very smooth.

100
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,547
I bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him, huh?

101
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,751
But that's what I'm talking about,
that's persistence, you see?

102
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,916
Once you set your cap
for something...

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,476
...or somebody,
you gotta Just, you know....

104
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,355
-Skylar.
-Mom, are you all right?

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,596
Hey, hey.

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,518
Honey, It's okay.

107
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,631
What's the matter?

108
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,351
What Is It?

109
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,355
Ask him.

110
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,391
What's she talking about?

111
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,274
Walt?

112
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,629
l have cancer.

113
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,273
Lung cancer.

114
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,471
It's bad.

115
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,837
Ask him how long he's known.

116
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,030
-I guess a month, maybe.
-0h, for God sakes, Walt.

117
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:54,390
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on.

118
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,033
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

119
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,709
Christ, these last 48 hours.

120
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,192
And it's the weekend, so I couldn't
even get his doctor on the phone.

121
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,277
Buddy, why--? I mean, why wouldn't
you wanna tell anybody?

122
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,032
Walt, don't you see
everybody just wants to help you.

123
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,119
We're family.
We get through these things together.

124
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,677
And I don't get, you know, lung cancer?
How can that happen?

125
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,313
-You don't even smoke.
-You know, I'm thinking...

126
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,351
...that this goes back 20 years,
maybe...

127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,030
...to the applications lab, all those
chemicals they had you working around.

128
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,390
We always took
the proper precautions.

129
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,751
One time you complained that
they didn't give you the right kind of...

130
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,077
...I don't know, some kind of
ventilation hood or something...

131
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,998
-...and then the headaches.
-Honey, It wasn't that.

132
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,430
How do they think
they can get away with this?

133
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:51,316
-We should hire a lawyer.
-Okay, so first let's deal with this.

134
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,228
Okay, so,
what's the next step for Walt?

135
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,351
Certainly a second opinion, right?

136
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,993
Right. Right, absolutely.

137
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,352
Okay, so first thing tomorrow,
I talk to my radiologists...

138
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,471
...we find you the best,
the oncology dream team.

139
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,478
That's good. That's good.

140
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,192
Yeah.

141
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,318
Yeah?

142
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,349
-Yeah, okay.
-0kay.

143
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,879
Yeah.

144
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,588
I'm gonna go check on Walt Jr.

145
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,311


146
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,909
...If I can talk hlm Into,
I don't know, Joining us.

147
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,193
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

148
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,799
Walt...

149
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,951
...whatever happens...

150
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,674
...I hope this goes without saying...

151
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,871
...but whatever happens...

152
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,590
...I want you to know that...

153
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,799
...I'II always take care of your family.

00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:11,915
Could be, yeah.
You know, from time to time.

167
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,793
I heard you lost your partner.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,194


169
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,914
Didn't he get locked up?

170
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,588
No, man, he's out.
His cousln balled him out.

171
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,630
lthlnk he sklpped town
or something.

172
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,034
I don't know about any of that,
I've Just been...

173
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,390
...klnd of doing my own thing
these days, so....

174
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:31,033
But you maybe
got some crystal, man?

175
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,869
Because I could seriously go for a bowl
right now, you know, take the edge off.

176
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,073
-Hell, yeah, Sunday night bowl, yo.
-All right.

177
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,394
Well, maybe it just so happens...

178
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:48,989
...that I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

179
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,468
Yeah?

180
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:54,115
Oh, yeah. Came up
with this whole new recipe.

181
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,276
It's more like a formula.

182
00:11:56,479 --> 00:12:00,631
It's, like,
way, way more chemically--

183
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,558
Shit, you know,
It's just the bomb, so....

184
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,672
But, you know, I don't know,
I've been thinking lately...

185
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,756
...I'II just lay off of it for a while...

186
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,792
...because lately it's been
kind of making me paranoid, so....

187
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,558
You know, for, like,
health-wise, just lay off.

188
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,992
Yo, if you're not into sharing, man,
just tell us to piss off, it's cool.

189
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,509
-We don't need no soap opera.
-Yeah, man, whatever.

190
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,472
No, no, it's all good, you know.

191
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,672
I'm just saying,
hey, I got plenty of pot.

192
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,030
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

193
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,310
Yeah, sounds about right.

194
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,637
Hey, yo, yo. Hey, homes, I'm joking.

195
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,672
Okay, I'm totally joking with you.

196
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,348
You kidding? Sit down.

197
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,273

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,474

00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,553
I'm right outside if you need me.

205
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,398

Can I just put that on a credit card?

209
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,955
Great. Perfect.

210
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,028
Okay, so we will see you at 10:45
on Friday morning.

211
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,674
Thank you so much.

212
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,393
Okay.

213
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,197
Oh, yes.

214
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,434
Honey...

215
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,189
...the best oncologist, I mean,
not even just in New Mexico...

216
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,357
...but one of the top 10
In the entire nation...

217
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,632
...his name is Dr. Delcavoli...

218
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,876
...and we see him on Friday.

219
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,750
I mean,
Marie really came through for us.

220
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,871
She had her boss call, and....

221
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,359
Okay, this Is good.

222
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,718
From here on out, things are gonna--

223
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,194
What's that we're putting on
a credit card?

224
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,392
It's just a deposit kind of thing.

225
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,593
-How much of a deposit?
-lt's $5000.

226
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,438
Flve thousand?

227
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,672
Jesus.

228
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,309
What's that, just to start? I mean...

229
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,589
...just to tell me
what I already know?

230
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,188
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?

231
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,118
So be it, we'll figure it out.

232
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,755
Come on,
don't get hung up on money here.

233
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,316
-We can always borrow from Hank.
-Absolutely not.

234
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,358
No, Ijust....

235
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,356
We're not gonna do that.

236
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,632
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.

237
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,916
Have you even called her yet?

238
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,632
Walt, regardless, you're gonna have to
tell her about this...

239
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,752
-...I mean, I'm willing to do It, but In
-l'll call. I'll call.

240
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:26,036
Okay, look...

241
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:30,474
...I don't even want us
thinking about money.

242
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,591
Money is not the issue here.

243
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,314
-lt's not.
-I know. I know.

244
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,754
It's not.

245
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,313
-Okay.
-Okay.

246
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,078
Okay.

247
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,109
I'll take care of the deposit.

248
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,833
Yeah?

249
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:48,832
Yeah.

250
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,353
I'll borrow it from my pension.

251
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,828
Damn It!

252
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,869
Hey. Hey, pal, what's up?

253
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:35,232
Oh, yeah, no, I thought I heard mice.

254
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,433
Boy, that's all we need, huh?

255
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,996
So, what's up, pal?

256
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,668
What the hell's wrong with you?

257
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,478
-What?
-You're actlng all....

258
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,432
You're....

259
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,114
You're all....
Why are you actlng so weird?

260
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,835
-Son.
-You're acting like nothing |s going on.

261
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,433
Oh, no, please. Please, please, no.

262
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,598
Hey, no, heyl

263
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,311
-Heyl
-Put that douche bag on the phone.

264
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,508
Oh, come on.

265
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:55,553
Hey, am I gonna have to
come down there and whup your ass?

266
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,710
And let me tell you something else,
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

267
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,149
I'm the best he's got.
He knows It, I know It...

268
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,591
...I expect to be paid to a level
commensurate with--

269
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:20,597
I said, "Dave, do you think 40 grand
is a proper bonus?"

270
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,758
That's less than 10 percent
of what I booked this quarter.

271
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,996
I'm not gonna sit here
and be disrespect--

272
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:28,235
Oh, he's shitting bricks.

273
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,759
Oh, you know he ls.

274
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,269
Yeah, that man lives In fear.
I'll go across town--

275
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,754
Hell, I could go anywhere.

276
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,871
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley, or Sorcher.

277
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,754
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me
a partner for walking in the damn door...

278
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,190
-...that's how ecstatlc they'd be.
-Next customer.

279
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,469
Hells, yes, brother man.

280
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:47,675
Dude, you should check this chick out.

281
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,432
Who? No.

282
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,392
Stacey's a cow.

283
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,473
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

284
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,639
Roll her in flour and look for
the wet spot before you hit that, man.

285
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,433
That kind of stink does not wash off.

286
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,914
-S|r?
-nght.

287
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,711
Slr.

288
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,634
Oh, yeah?

289
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,831
-Sorry. HI.
-Oh, totally.

290
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,076
-Hi. What can I do for you today?
-Which dude?

291
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,588
-That dude that looks like a lizard?
-Next In line.

292
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,189
-And he llmps like some leper.
-l'm sorry, lwould llke...

293
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,276
-...a cashier's cheque...
-Grosses me out.

294
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,629
...in the full amount...

295
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,436
...made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

296
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,310
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

297
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,316
Yeah, you got It.

298
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,315
I don't understand
why they're forcing you...

299
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,191
...to choose between
plccolo and oboe.

300
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,117
You show so much promise
with both.

301
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,549
They can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

302
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,478
No matter how they divide it up,
someone would be left out.

303
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,717
-Rules are rules, I guess.
-Sure, rules are rules. I'm all for that.

304
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,957
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

305
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,469
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

306
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,272
Thanks.

307
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,948
What about Mr. Pemberton?

308
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,276
Is he giving you enough
individual attention?

309
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,675
I'd say so.
He tries to talk to each one of us...

310
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,870
...at least once during every practise.

311
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:12,754
-That's good. Feedback's important.
-It's key, Ithink.

312
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:16,117
Hey, so how was soccer practise?

313
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,152
I think that was in our backyard.

314
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,948
Who's there?

315
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,674
What the hell are you doing out here?

316
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,835
Hey, Dad.

317
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,634
Hey, Mom.

318
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,593
Jake.

319
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,393
Got new patio furniture.

320
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,031
Right on.

321
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,270
What do you think it could be?

322
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,876
God knows I'm no expert.

323
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,549
I don't know. Uppers, downers?
Your guess is as good as mine.

324
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,195
I think we should check his arms
for needle marks.

325
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,594
Do we let him stay?

326
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,717
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

327
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,434
So maybe on condition, you know?
If he agrees to attend.

328
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,194
I just don't know what to tell Jake.

329
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,796
-Hey.
-Hey. Good evening.

330
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,589
Well? Sleep well?

331
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:46,071
What time's--? What time is dinner?

332
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,509
In about an hour.

333
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:55,232
You know,
I could wash those clothes If you like.

334
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,317
They look a little lived in.

335
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,829
No, that's cool. Maybe later.

336
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,799
We are not doing this again.

337
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,712


338
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,912
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

339
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,917
We just have to be
consistent about It.

340
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,358
Hey.

341
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,948
You're not taking the bus?

342
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,316
All right. Well, listen.

343
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:14,871
Give me maybe another 20 minutes,
and we'll get out of here.

344
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,277
-All right.
-All right.

345
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,671
Yeah, good.

346
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,549
You know, I just think that...

347
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,911
...thlngs have a way
of working themselves out.

348
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,670
When did you get this?

349
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:27,995
Last May at the year-end assembly.

350
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,998
They gave me that one too.
The one on the end.

351
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,716
Environmental Consciousness
Award.

352
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,549
What's that mean? What, you,
like, recycle cans and shit?

353
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,471
I contacted
The Albuquerque Journal...

354
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,352
...and asked what chemicals
they use to bleach their paper.

355
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,518
-Wound up writing an article about it.
-Right on, little bro.

356
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,439
Making mad inroads
with the business community.

357
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:52,118
All right.

358
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,992
Now, hey, remember...

359
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,829
...not all learning
comes out of books.

360
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,078
Look at you.

361
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,114
You know, we should--
We should hang out more often.

362
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,313
You know, just kick back and chill.

363
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,395
I mean, If you ever, like,
I don't know, need advice.

364
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,355
Because, you know, I've been--
I've been through it all. For real.

365
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,950
Yeah, man, you-- You play the flute?

366
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,474
-lt's a plccolo, actually.
-Dude, play some Jethro Tull.

367
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,034
Hey, guys, how we doing in here?

368
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,835
We're good.

369
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,993
-Jake?
-Yeah. Flne, Mom.

370
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,671
Well, that's good. That's great.

371
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,509
You know, what the hell?
You see this?

372
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,872
What am I,
some criminal or something?

373
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:04,473
-Whatever.
-Whatever?

374
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,829
What, you think that's okay?

375
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,239
Like, "Oh, we can't let that scumbag
warp the mind of our favourite son."

376
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:13,838
I'm the favourite?

377
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,718
Yeah, right.

378
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,990
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

379
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,392
Oh, snap.

380
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,317
Awesome.

381
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,188
-Yeah?
-Yo, man, It's me.

382
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,950
Hey, listen. You know that product?

383
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,797
You got any more of that?

384
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,990
No, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebles.

385
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,395
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

386
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,272
No, no charlty. No.

387
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,710
I got this cousln,
he's got him some rich frlends.

388
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,558
These dudes are In town,
they're looking to party.

389
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,069
And your stuff is, like, so sweet.

390
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,917
So, what do you say?

391
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,397
You up for making some fat stacks?

392
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,749
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

393
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:12,909
Yes. Yes. Okay.

394
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:20,475
Oh, you can't be serious.

395
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,557
What the hell are you doing here?

396
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:28,230
Yo, I waited till the ball buster left.
I mean, no offence.

397
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,638
Who sent you, huh?

398
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,273
-You wearing a wire?
-Hey. Jesus.

399
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:34,958
-You settlng me up?
-Homo.

400
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,912
A wire? You want a wire?

401
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,758
I got a wire.
Speak Into the mike, bltch.

402
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,392
What the hell's wrong with you?

403
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,352
A wire.

404
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,754
Jesus.

405
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,198
-So who did you tell about...?
-Nobody. What, are you nuts?

406
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,709
Then why are you here?

407
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,232
I don't know.

408
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:58,556
To, llke, touch base.

409
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,235
Touch base?

410
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,311
Yeah, you know.

411
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,989
What they call a debrief.

412
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,837
Maybe we could, like--

413
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:10,711
Thought we could debrief.

414
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,672
Debrlef?

415
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,598
Wow, that's--

416
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:17,836
That's what you think we need,
debrlef?

417
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,839
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

418
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,916
Kind of, you know, talk about it.

419
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,839
I mean, we can't talk to anybody else.

420
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,918
Anyway, that and I wanted to--

421
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,188
Wanted to, you know...

422
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,154
...tell you how much everybody digs
that meth we cooked.

423
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,234
Everybody digs the meth we cooked.

424
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,031
Seriously. I got dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

425
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,272
-Great.
-l'm just saying, I mean, If you ever...

426
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,076
...you know, saw your way clear...

427
00:35:55,279 --> 00:36:01,752
...to, you know,
you and l cooking a little more....

428
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,192
Get the hell off my property.

429
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,039
-What? I'm just saying.
-Go. And don't come back.

430
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,158


431
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,439
All right.

432
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,638
All right, you know what?

433
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,751
Four grand.

434
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:28,149
Your share from selling that batch.

435
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,909
That's why I'm here.

436
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:35,318
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Hey, I didn't smoke It all.

437
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,628
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.

438
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,355
Stage 3A, which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

439
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,915
There's no denying it's very serious.

440
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,635
But lt-- ls lt--?

441
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,911
It Is...

442
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,993
...curable?

443
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,949
I prefer the word "treatable."

444
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,358
But the treatments we have
at our disposal can be very effective.

445
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,790
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that the specific course...

446
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:29,833
...of radiation and chemotherapy I'm
going to suggest has been successful.

447
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,192
In certain cases, it's prolonged a
patient's life and resulted in remission.

448
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,394
What about the side effects?

449
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,956
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent.

450
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,957
Or they can be pretty darn awful.

451
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,630
It varies from patient to patient.
Typically, there's hair loss...

452
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,469
...which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

453
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,838
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

454
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,757
You won't want to get out of bed.

455
00:37:56,959 --> 00:38:00,838
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

456
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,076
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

457
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:07,954
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea...

458
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,630
...although we'll prescribe an
antiemetic and try to counteract that.

459
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,558
Possible kidney or bladder irritation.

460
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:16,114
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

461
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:22,110
There are maybe sexual symptoms.
Your skin may become dry....

462
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,075
Got anything to say?

463
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:58,832
What do you know about that?

464
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,953
-Nothlng.
-Well, that's not gonna fly this time.

465
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,799
How many chances
have we given you?

466
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:07,751
How many times have we
sat right here...

467
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,315
...and had the same conversation
over and over again?

468
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,875
Where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance?

469
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,592
And you play on our emotions...

470
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,837
...and tell us anything and everything
you think we want to hear...

471
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,507
...just so we'll give you
another chance.

472
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,837
And It makes us feel like fools.
Every time.

473
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,869
Enough, Jesse.

474
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,314


475
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,279
We are not going to have this
In our house.

476
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,068
We need you to leave.

477
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,996
Thanks for not telling on me.

478
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,915
You think I could have it back?

479
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,109
It's skunk-weed anyway.

480
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,268
The Alr Force ls aware
of the wldely-held bellef...

481
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:05,834
...that some of these
could be ﬂylng saucers from--

482
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,189
You know,
this Is actually very hopeful.

483
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,038
Nothlng concluslve
In the evldence...

484
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,799
...but probing and digesting
of information about UFOs...

485
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,399
...continues unceasingly.

486
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,313
Did you hear me?

487
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:19,875
I said this Is really
very, very hopeful.

488
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,675
Defence Command in
Colorado Springs issued an order--

489
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,192
So can I call them
and tell them you'll start next week?

490
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,714
Even as they did so,
the military wondered whether...

491
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,354
thelr sclentlﬂc know-how
and thelr best weapons...

492
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:42,078
...would be effective in any battle
of the Earth versus the flying saucers.

493
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,350
I just think that we need to discuss it
a little more, that's all.

494
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,868
What is there to discuss?

495
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,389
You're gonna get the best treatment,
and he's the best.

496
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,958
Well, there's the money discussion.
I think-- No, $90,000 out of pocket.

497
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,912
-Maybe more.
-There's a way, Walt.

498
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,347
There's flnanclng...

499
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,632
...there's instalment plans.
I could always go back to work.

500
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,150
-Walt, there's always a way.
-All right.

501
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,192
Skyler, say that there is a way.

502
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,358
And we spend all that money, and....

503
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,758
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

504
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,588
No. Honey.

505
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,190
I just don't want emotions ruling us.

506
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:41,678
Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.

507
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,117
Then why don't you just fucking dle,
already?

508
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,469
Just give up and die.

509
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,275
Come on, move your ass.

510
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,551
Name of the guy? You'll like him.

511
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,590
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.
I got the best fricking attorney.

512
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:52,188
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one.

513
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,313
He's got this little team of ninjas, too,
that go out and do forward operations--

514
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:58,555
He's got crap on people.

515
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,674
What the hell?

516
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,797
-What?
-Don't go near It, buddy.

517
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:19,275
What--? What are you doing?
Call somebody. Call the fire people.

518
00:45:19,479 --> 00:45:21,117
Yeah. I have a flre....

519
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,992
I don't believe this.
Do you know how much I paid for that?

520
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,950
Why are you doing this?
