1
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,833
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,511
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,636
-What?
-Ju:t take the rest of the weak.

4
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:34,433
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,277
Don't push It.

6
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,471
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

7
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,028
Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,755
It's Just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,190
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,153
Just family and a few friends.

11
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,473
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,833


13
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,672
Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,438


15
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,390
...what are you supposed
to do today?

16
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,797
-Nothlng.
-Excellent.

17
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,994
Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,712
Can you meet?

19
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,713
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

20
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,318


21
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,750
Signed-- Signed off.

22
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,428
l was even checking the obits.

23
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,558


24
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,437
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,708
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,672
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,517
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,753
The upshot.

29
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,797
The upshot Is that
l have radlatlon pneumonltls.

30
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,795


31
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,195
Actually, It's not
as bad as It sounds.

32
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,553
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easlly treated.

33
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,276
In fact...

34
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,313
...the news is all good.

35
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,957
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,439
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,598
What, you mean, like,
remlsslon good?

38
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,069
Remission. Not to imply l'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,355
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumours.

40
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,997
How slgnlflcant?

41
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,271
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,550
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,717
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

44
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,715
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,752
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,554
That's-- That's great, man.

47
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,150
I mean, my aunt, she never--
I mean, you know, at your stage...

48
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,476
...I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,079
Yeah.

50
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,669
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,552
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,476
Of course. I am.

53
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,915
Okay, now we....

54
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,155
I mean, what do we...?

55
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,193
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:12,188
So how do you want to...

57
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,308
...you know, proceed...

58
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,079
...in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,157
We'll take our time
and stay cautlous.

60
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,271
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,037
And then....

62
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,556
Well, then I guess...

63
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,278


64
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,514
-Batter up.
-Everyone?

65
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

66
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,797
-...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
-Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,677
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

68
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,873
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,274
But then again...

70
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,836
...Hank does make
one mean margarlta.

71
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,992
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,475
These last few months have been...

73
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,591
...wow, a challenging time,
to put It mlldly.

74
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,154
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:44,351
-All right.
-Honey, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,157
We all are.

77
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,509
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

78
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,596
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,110
And for the first time
In a long time...

80
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,153
...we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,593
Okay, anyway...

82
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,359
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

83
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,314
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,352
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,232
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

86
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,318
...for those of you
who don't know them, are....

87
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,110
Well, they're heroes.

88
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,074
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

89
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,952
...to pay for Walt's treatment.

90
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,558
And they did.

91
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,279


92
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,393
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

93
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,156
-To Gretchen and Elliot.
-Cheers.

94
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,113
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

95
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,639
-Speech.
-Yes.

96
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,272
-Speech.
-Yeah, Dad.

97
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,754
Come on, Walt. Speech.

98
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,557
Well, It's....

99
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,239
It's kind of funny.

100
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,675
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

101
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,869
...I said to myself, you know:

102
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,269
'Why me?'

103
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,878
And then...

104
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,192
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

105
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,509
...I said the same thing.

106
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,874
Anyway.

107
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,956
Thank you for coming.

108
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:38,596
And enjoy.

109
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,279
-All right, cheers.
-Yeah.

110
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,753
Cheers.

111
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,078
lnsplratlonal.

112
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,391
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

113
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,589
I'll tell you that much.

114
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,236
A little mercury swltch,
9-volt battery...

115
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:58,398
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

116
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,274
Yeah, but why a turtle?

117
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:04,039
Oh, that's the best part. It was a....

118
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,548
It was a.... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,270
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
It's a....

120
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,868
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

121
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,073
Anyway...

122
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,874
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

123
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,275
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

124
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,996
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

125
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,475
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

126
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,272
Anyway.

127
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,233
Poetlc.

128
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,274
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

129
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,311
I guess that's the word.

130
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,515


131
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,792
Better not let your mom see.

132
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,355
Oh, yeah, lthlnk I see a hair.
Maybe two.

133
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,513
-There's no worm in this, right?
-No, that would be mescal.

134
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,914
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

135
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,078
l was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

136
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,510
Had this flrearm Instructor
who was....

137
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:40,279
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

138
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,710
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

139
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,433
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

140
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,517
We were drinking mescal stupid.

141
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,755
But-- Hey, hey.

142
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,714
Wait, what you doing there?

143
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,552
What does it look like I'm doing?

144
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,678
The kld's 16.

145
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,190
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

146
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,836
What are you looking at him for?

147
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,511
We're celebrating. Come on.

148
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,072
That's all right.

149
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,668


150
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,198
Jesus.

151
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,509
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

152
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:52,756
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

153
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,233
Hey.

154
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,749
Bring the bottle back.

155
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,598
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

156
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,478
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

157
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,076
-lt's all right.
-What are you waiting for?

158
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,428
Bring It back.

159
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,750
Why don't we just call it a day?

160
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,479
All right, pal?

161
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,956
-We good?
-The bottle.

162
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,948


163
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,877
What's going on?

164
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,433
Jesus.

165
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,634
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

166
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,432
Oh, my God.

167
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,470
Okay. Okay.

168
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,757
There you go. Okay. That's it.

169
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,154
Just get it out. That's okay.

170
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,068
This Is your brain.

171
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,511
This is your brain on drugs.

172
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,831
You weren't supposed to wake up.

173
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,155
Ever or...?

174
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,750
No, l was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

175
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,356
You want me to go back to bed?

176
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,036
No, I guess that'd be kind of--

177
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,438


178
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,399
Need some help?

179
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,430
No, I got It.

180
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,558
Just have a seat.

181
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,511
Is there any coffee?

182
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,794
Yeah, shit. One second.

183
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,876
Well, at least let me do that.

184
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,117
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

185
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:34,229
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

186
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,319
lt's huevos rancheros.

187
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,314
-I can tell.
-Yeah?

188
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,155
-Fork.
-Oh, yeah.

189
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,918
There you go.

190
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,476
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

191
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,035
-Whatever that means.
-No.

192
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,517
I'm all yours.

193
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:09,868
Really?

194
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,554
Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.

195
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,953


196
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,230
I just wanted to say that....

197
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,589


198
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,473
We'll talk tonlght...

199
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,308
...but I wanted to say that...

200
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,117
...l'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

201
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,151
...but It wasn't me.

202
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:21,358
And I'm sorry.

203
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,192
Love you.

204
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,837
Oh, boy.

205
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,875
ljust wanted to say that...

206
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,228
No.

207
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,952
We'll talk tonlght,
but I wanted to say that...

208
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:25,478
Hey there.

209
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,433
-Wow, who brought the churros?
-That would be me.

210
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:32,949
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so....

211
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,917
They're actually-- They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,950
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,918
Actually...

214
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,677
...Walt's got....

215
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,549
He's been battling cancer.

216
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,112
-Skyler--
-And last week we got good news.

217
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,278
-l'm so sorry.
-But we're really optlmIstIc.

218
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,754
Great.

219
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,469
-Great. Good news Is great.
-Yeah.

220
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,034
Yeah, It Is. It really ls.

221
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,472
Well...

222
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,433
...feel free to bring these any time.

223
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,118
Yeah.

224
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,995
Got some real beauts.

225
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,513
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the ca.

226
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,198
Yeah?

227
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,158
Then again, what about tankless?

228
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,357
Sure. We got them.

229
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,074
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

230
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,238
Set you back about 1200.

231
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,514
It's not an Issue.

232
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,428
You want installation, right?

233
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:02,076
-No. I'm gonna do it myself.
-That's what I like to hear.

234
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,232
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,349
That's Hover Man.

236
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,312
He can surf, skate, glide...

237
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,877
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,469
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,990
And this guy?
What's hls superpower?

240
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,068
That's Kanga-man.

241
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:41,747
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,069
-And who's this In his pouch?
-H|s sldeklck, Joey.

243
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,718
He rIdes around In his pouch
and, you know...

244
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,433
...flghts crlme.

245
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,472
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,991
You know that, right?

247
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,675
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

248
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,278
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:03,834
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,235
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,274
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nlce haunches.

252
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,591
-And this Is?
-lt's Backwardo.

253
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:19,352
Walt, no. I actually--
I changed It to Rewlndo.

254
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,550
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,351
He can make everything
go In reverse.

256
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,515
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?

257
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,154
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,029
He walks backwards?

259
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:34,277
Is that a superpower?
What good Is that?

260
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,755
No, I mean, he does It,
like, really fast.

261
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,757
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,111
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,912
Okay.

264
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,508
Yo, I was a kid...

265
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,199
...when I drew all these.

266
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,829
It was like four years ago.

267
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,637
-They all look like you.
-What?

268
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,555
lt's you in all of these.

269
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,792


270
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:03,877
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,150
Oh, shut up.

272
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,316
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

273
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,595
-Is that your door or mine?
-I don't know.

274
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,676
It sounds like mine.

275
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,476
-I gotta go.
-Where?

276
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,473
Hey, where?

277
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,436
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

278
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,959
Jane.

279
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,833
Jane.

280
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,954
-Hey, Dad.
-There you are.

281
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,313
HI, honey.

282
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,352
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,557
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,875
Finally realised that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,475
-Exactly.
-Well, lwas In the neighbourhood.

286
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,319
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

287
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,713
Sure. Yeah.

288
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,433
Hey, this your dad?

289
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,272
-Yes.
-Hello.

290
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,674


291
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,517
This is the new tenant.

292
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,234
-Donald.
-Jesse.

293
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,675
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

294
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,192
-No.
-Dad, why don't you come In?

295
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,912
It was nice seeing you.

296
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,952
-It was nice to meet you.
-You too.

297
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,719
Hey, Dad.

298
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,669
-Hey, son. Are you home early?
-No.

299
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,398
Oh, man.

300
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:49,869
It was a good day?

301
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,916
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

302
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,030
Yes. Yes, Indeed.

303
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:59,595
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,119
-Sweet.
-Yeah.

305
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,233
-Hey, want to take her for a spin?
-Oh, yeah.

306
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,995
LIsten, why don't you

307
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,272
Let me know when you're ready,

308
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,993
Okay.

309
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,797

-Ready.
-All right. Let her rIp.

314
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,511
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

315
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,029
BuIIt-In corroslon-reslstant

00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:41,594
...safety thermocouple
with the leot burner.

317
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,790
Sounds really good, Dad.

318
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,078
And the energy savings. I mean....

319
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,315
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

320
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,193
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

321
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,914
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay.

322
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,438


323
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,875
-...about yesterday--
-l'm sorry about the pool.

324
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,148
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

325
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,958
See, your....

326
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,635
Your old man embarrassed himself...

327
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,990
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

328
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:19,828
l have to say I feel very foolish.

329
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:26,273
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

330
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,677
No. No. We're flne.
Everything's flne.

331
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:33,588
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

332
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,830
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:43,552
I should have used
better judgement all around.

334
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,591
Havlng you drink In the first place,
It was not right...

335
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,869
...and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,237
But I kept up, right?

337
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,073
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:07,275
l have some tools to put away.

339
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,238
Hey.

340
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:11,474
Yo.

341
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,749
You want to catch a movie later?

342
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,432
Yo.

343
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,830
-What?
-What was that all about?

344
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,033
What?

345
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,549
Before. With your dad.

346
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,192
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,235
Oh, okay, so I totally
just mlsread your total dIs?

348
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,589
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

349
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,312
A favour?

350
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,110
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

351
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,913
-He seemed cool to me.
-Yeah, well.

352
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,316
-So, what's the deal?
-There's no deal.

353
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,716

Protectlng you.

354
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,352
-How's that?
-I mean...

355
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,472
...l'm letting you smoke In here
and everything.

356
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,629
I bought a filter.

357
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,115
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:06,234
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

359
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,839
So?

360
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,357
-So?
-You think I'm gonna be all like:

361
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,515
'Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

362
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:16,074
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with hlm'?

363
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,713
That's all you think you're doing?

364
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,429
-Why do you even care about my dad?
-I don't.

365
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,834
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

366
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,509
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

367
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,029
-Us.
-Yeah.

368
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,155
You and me.

369
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,990
Who's you and me?

370
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,113
I'm out of here.

371
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,239
Oh, boy.

372
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,472
Dad?

373
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,948
Dad? Hello?

374
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,278
What? Oh, hey.

375
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:49,227
-What are you doing?
-We've got rot.

376
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,954
-Rot?
-Yeah. Here.

377
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,468
I'll show you. Here.

378
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:55,668
Take a look at that.

379
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,917
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like It?

380
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,715
-lt's wood.
-lt's wood...

381
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,558
...that contains fruiting bodies.

382
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,388
Frulty what?

383
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:11,712
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

384
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,876
I don't really see anything.

385
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,390
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

386
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,110
Then you cut it all out.

387
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,631
You just cut it out and start fresh.

388
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:26,279
Well, better get to it.

389
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,438
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

390
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,996
Not If I can help It.

391
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,795
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

392
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,710
-Go home already.
-I will. I will.

393
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,268
Hey, can ljust ask...

394
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,833
-...the Keller account?
-The Keller account?

395
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,554
lt's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

396
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:20,638
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so....

397
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:21,828
Oh, God.

398
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,112
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

399
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,471
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

400
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,590
...with these little companies.

401
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,236
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

402
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,633
nght.

403
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,193
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

404
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:42,272
Sky?

405
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,395
Skyler?

406
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,157
Jesus.

407
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,436
No, I'm fine.

408
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:57,518
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the tIme.

409
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,431
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:08,638
What's wrong?

411
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,872
I guess It just...

412
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,829
...doesn't feel any different.

413
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:27,031
The good news?

414
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:32,152
I mean, nothing's really changed.

415
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,836
It's just postponed.

416
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,637
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

417
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,034
But lately, it just feels like....

418
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,478
More tunnel.

419
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,631
I'm sorry.

420
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:01,033
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

421
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,711
I don't know.

422
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,191
For me, it was the flu.

423
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:09,910
-What?
-My dad rallled at the end.

424
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,395
I mean, It wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

425
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,034
...dlfferent circumstances,
but we were happy...

426
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,797
...we were over the moon.

427
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:20,116
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,193
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:26,152
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

430
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,114
-Great tlmlng, huh?
-Yeah.

431
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,954
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

432
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,673
'Why now?'

433
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,517
Being that rock.

434
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,039
You know...

435
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,758
...belng that rock
takes everything you got.

436
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,279
Yeah.

437
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,150
--causlng the houslng prlces
to trend.

438
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,716
Foreclosures are belng fuelled
by a splke In....

439
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,638
The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.

440
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,435
With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending...

441
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,995
the houslng market
ls unllkely to rebound...

442
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,759
...speIIlng more paln
for the economy.

443
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,113
Yeah.

444
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,034
Are you going to work today?

445
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,396
Skyler, there's rot.

446
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,513


447
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:27,874
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

448
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,990
-Good night, Ted.
-Good night.

449
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,231
Oh, damn.

450
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,031
-CIumsy.
-I got It.

451
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:46,389
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

452
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,675
Get organised. Storage containers
to meet every need...

453
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,348
...big or small, on Aisle 3.

454
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,075
Stashlng your stuff
has never been so easy.

455
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,676
Get a thlcker, fuller lawn
In less than slx weeks.

456
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,917
Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?

457
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,634
Go to Aisle 10 to go green.

458
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,678
Get a manager
on Checkout 4, please.

459
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,916
Manager to Checkout 4.

460
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,037
Pest problems? No problem.

461
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:08,868
Your extermlnatlon destlnatlon
ls Alsle 6.

462
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,196
You're buying the wrong matches.

463
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,750
-What?
-Those matches.

464
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:15,153
They're the wrong kind.

465
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,388
Red phosphorous Is found
In the striker strlps...

466
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,397
...not the matches themselves.

467
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,149
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

468
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:30,077
More striker strips. You understand?

469
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,916
Those only have the one.

470
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,509
And don't buy everything
In one place.

471
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,913
Do It pIecemeal.

472
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,430
Different items, different stores.
Attracts less attention.

473
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,678
Are you following me here?

474
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,591
You've been putting off
refinishing that deck long enough.

475
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,234
We have everything you need
to do the job right.

476
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,633
-Thanks.
-Sure.

477
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,796
-Next.
-H|. Here you go.

478
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:35,835
-You didn't buy my stuff?
-No, I didn't.

479
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:37,552
We don't have time for this.

480
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,876
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.

481
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:07,156
Stay out of my territory.
