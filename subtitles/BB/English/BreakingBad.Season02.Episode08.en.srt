Dude, I so smell bacon.

00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,194
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,991
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,919
How about over there.

13
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,194
That'a youra, right?

14
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,230

15
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,515
Parked all inconspicuous.

16
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,710
It's a cop van.

20
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,828
Dude, I just wanna get high.

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,156
A flower van.

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,353
You know what you should do

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,437
Serloualy, and I don't mean

25
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,310

I'm seriously thinking...

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,671
...that there's cope
In the back of a garbage truck.

27
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,389
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,670
Think about It, boya.

29
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,552

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,118
You dudes give up that easy?

31
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,230
I'm not a cop.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,236
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,359
All right, you know what?

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,233
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

35
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,430
l'm blinded by white.

36
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,594


37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,189
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,630
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,998
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,349
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,356
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:15,197
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,960
lthlnk you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,115
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,392
ljuat need you to prove It,
you know?

46
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,032
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,833
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,272
I don't know.

49
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,671
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,552
Which dude?

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,954
-That dude?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,515
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,919
True that.

54
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,356
-Thla la so hard, you know?
-Yeah.

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,519


56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,478
It's simple.

57
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,952
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,956
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,196
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:06,953
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,355
-You a cop?
-No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,595
Aak |t, llke, offlclal.

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,268
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,189
No, lam not a police officer.

65
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,311
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,197
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,071
All right.

68
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,272
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,797
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,512
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,998

On your stomach! Get on the ground!

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,952
Hold It right there. Don't move.

73
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,995
I had a goodjob
until my boss accused me ofstealing.

74
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,036
I'd better call Saul!

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,311
I was out partying,
minding my own business...

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,036
-You are under arrest.
-l'd better call Saul!

77
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:57,954
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.

78
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,797
Did you know that you have rights?

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,355
The Constitution says you do.
And so do i.

80
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,436
I believe that until proven guilty...

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,676
...every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.

82
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,756
And that's why i fight for you,
Albuquerque.

83
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,914
Better call Saul.

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,111
Saui Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.

85
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,197
That's 505-164-CALL.

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,355
I really need to get some furniture.

87
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,038
I suggest you start with a bed.

88
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,753
God, lwish we could smoke in here.

89
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,156
-Well, you can't.
-Yeah, no. I know.

90
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:35,270
I'm Just saying.

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,352
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

92
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,357
You better serlously hope
that alrs out.

93
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,199
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,511


95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,278
Yeah?

96
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,518
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,149
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,911
Well, llsten.

99
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,790
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,468
...maybe we should light up.

101
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,831
No, thanks.

102
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:14,994
You sure?

103
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,789
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

104
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:21,149
Maybe you'll change your mind.

105
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,196
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,195
Hey. What'd I say?

107
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,153
Nothing.

108
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,196
ljust have to go Is all.

109
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,834
What's this?

110
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,872
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,434
I'm In recovery.

112
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,032
And, you know,
pot |s like stepping stones.

113
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,312
Recovery? That's cool.

114
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,793
Right on.

115
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,999
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

116
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,997
It's just a sometime thing.

117
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,032
But no more, like, in the house.

118
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,557
So you wanna go grab
some dinner?

119
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,149
I could really go for some Chinese.

120
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,758
No, I better bit It.

121
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,032
We....

122
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,873
We cool?

123
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,792
Your satellite is on, by the way.

124
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,235
That screen is badass.

125
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,951
ljust think it's asking a lot.

126
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,070
He knows |t.

127
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,872
He's done nothing but apologise.

128
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,879
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

129
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,231
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

130
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,831
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

131
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,314
So when the laziest boy
In the world wakes up...

132
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,397
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

133
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,554
And I said bye.

134
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,990
And tell him
to let them a|r-dry this time.

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

136
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,595
What?

137
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,275
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

138
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,515


139
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,311
No, It's just you....

140
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,350
You look nice Is all.

141
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,675
It's work, Wait.
And everybody |s gonna be there.

142
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,755
-0kay.
-0kay.

143
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,314
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

144
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,872
Okay.

145
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,514
-Bye.
-Bye.

146
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:15,351
Hi. You've reached Wait,
Skyler and Waiter, Jr.

147
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,790
Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.

148
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:22,311
Skyler? Are you there?
i don't know what to do.

149
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,955
i.... ineed to talk to you. i....

150
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,550
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

151
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,519
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

152
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,549
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

153
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,316
-A man was killed?
-A Federale, right in front of him.

154
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,431
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

155
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,110
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

156
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:55,992
-The IEDs.
-0h, Jesus.

157
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:58,918
I had to hear about It
from Steve Gomez.

158
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,428
Hank talked to his ASAc
for about an hour.

159
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,757
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

160
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,871
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

161
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,677
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

162
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,431
Baby, not now.

163
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,478
lt's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.

164
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,036
Hey, buddy. What's...?

165
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,719
What's up?

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,479
ljust....

167
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,956
Do you mind If I...?

168
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,071


169
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,797


170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,069
How you doing?

171
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
Oh, you know, lousy.

172
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,193
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

173
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,519
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

174
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,398
Better not get too close.

175
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,433
Well, I'll take my chances.

176
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,954
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juarez?

177
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,192
Terrlble.

178
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,389
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

179
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,158
It's like Apocalypse Now
down there.

180
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,035
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up In his jungle.

181
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,955
And my SAc In El Paso
sends me home.

182
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,349
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

183
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,518
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

184
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,710
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

185
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,309
...you send him home. You know?

186
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,314
l was, you know--
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

187
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,350
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

188
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,915
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

189
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,193
So are you home for good then?

190
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,551
No, no. It's....

191
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,469
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

192
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,548
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

193
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,672
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

194
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,473
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

195
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:42,070
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

196
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,039
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I....

197
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,950
You know, the things I deal with...

198
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,237
...you and me don't have much of a--

199
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,319
What you might call
'an experiential overlap.'

200
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,548
What if I told you we do?

201
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,038
l have spent my whole life scared.

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,992
Frightened of things
that could happen...

203
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,430
...might happen, might not happen.

204
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,996
Fifty years I spent like that.

205
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:42,109
Flndlng myself awake
at 3 In the morning.

206
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,317
But you know what?

207
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,747
Ever since my diagnosis...

208
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,231
...I sleep just fine.

209
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,193
Okay.

210
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:06,953
And I came to realise
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

211
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,229
That's the real enemy.

212
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,399


213
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,912
Get up.

214
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,554
Get out in the real world.

215
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,710
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

216
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,719
Do It again. Go on.

217
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,558
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

218
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,076
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

219
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,750
-I want It running 24 hours a day.
-nght on.

220
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,393
Not yours, I take |t.

221
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,228
We got 10, 20, 30...

222
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:18,229
...44, five each.

223
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,351
Three pounds should be 48 each.

224
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,549
Who's short?

225
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,399
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

226
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,476
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

227
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,875
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

228
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,718
...so he's probably still in the sack.

229
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,628
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

230
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,194
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

231
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,788
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

232
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,308
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

233
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,469
Jack-off.

234
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,637
It's going straight to voicemail.

235
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,039
Volcemall?

236
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,116
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

237
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,354
-Combo.
-Yo, what's up?

238
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,676
You seen Badger?

239
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,477
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

240
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,433
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

241
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,993
Well?

242
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,075
They were too scared to tell me.

243
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,198
Badger got busted.

244
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,117
He's |n jall.

245
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,269
Honey, l'm homel

246
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,596
Too slow! What's up?

247
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,518
Got more lives than a damn cat.

248
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,597
Now If I could only learn
to lick myself.

249
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,751
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

250
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,589
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

251
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,916
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

252
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,474
You okay?

253
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,112
Hanglng In?

254
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,958
What's it look like?

255
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,359
-What's this from A.P.D.?
-Been checking with them to see...

256
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,914
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

257
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,474
Sure enough, last night.

258
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,988
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

259
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:19,350
l was thinking of crulslng over
and saying hello.

260
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,479
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

261
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,834
Yeah. Well, all right.

262
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,716
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

263
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,231
Ifeel manipulated.

264
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,953
I thought we were gonna hang out.

265
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,592
We are hanging out, Badger.

266
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,030
You like Badger or Brandon?

267
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,118
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

268
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,435
Badger, llsten.

269
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,313
Hey.

270
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,950
I'm trying to help you here, man.

271
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,632
Now, If you just tell me
who your supplier ls...

272
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,638
...I think this can end
very well for you.

273
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,672
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

274
00:18:58,879 --> 00:18:59,868
You sneaky Pete.

275
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,433
Which is which?

276
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:04,948
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

277
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,878
You guys get younger every--

278
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,672
What'd you say to baby face?

279
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,232
Did you say anything stupid?

280
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,351
By 'anythlng stupld,'
I mean anything at all.

281
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,914
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twltter.

282
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,349
We'll talk about It later.
Right now, you out.

283
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,676
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detectlve.

284
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,949
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

285
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:26,708
Go grab a julce box.
Have a nap. Go on.

286
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,074
All right.

287
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,872
Who do we have?

288
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,708
Brandon Mayhew.

289
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,071
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

290
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,555
Brandon Mayhew.

291
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,153
-Here we go. Publlc masturbatlon.
-What?

292
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,113
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

293
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,790
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

294
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,388
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

295
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,431
That aln't me, man. I....

296
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:03,190
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

297
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,111
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

298
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,356
Sorry, that was a little
transposltlonal error.

299
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,073
Nothlng a little Wlte-Out
can't take care of.

300
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,077
Yeah, and felony quantity.

301
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,475
-Just barely.
-Yeah, just barely.

302
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,592
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

303
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,596
But good luck arguing that in court.

304
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,398
Let me get down to brass tacks.

305
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,238
l'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

306
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,350
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

307
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,835
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

308
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,032
...and they're gonna
deliver me a cheque for $4650.

309
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:36,753
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

310
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,394
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

311
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,559
And I need that in a cashier's cheque
or a money order, doesn't matter.

312
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,115
Actually, I want it in a money order.

313
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,959
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

314
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,514
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

315
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,676
It's done just for tax purposes.

316
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,313
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

317
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,228
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

318
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,429
Any questions?

319
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,157
You're gonna get me off, right?

320
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,829
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

321
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:14,556
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

322
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:18,389
Son, I promise you this.

323
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,592
lw|ll give you
the best crlmlnal defence...

324
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,118
...that money can buy.

325
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:27,035
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

326
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:28,877
Didn't I take these already?

327
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,913
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

328
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,916
It's bad for the liver.

329
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,476
Okay, who's next?

330
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,829
Did him. I did him.

331
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:42,189
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

332
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,358
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

333
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,358
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

334
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,115
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

335
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,834
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

336
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,034
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

337
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,911
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

338
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,792
Is she still offering
the two-for-one dlscount?

339
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:05,752
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

340
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,952
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

341
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,357
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

342
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,789
You want your exponential growth...

343
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,955
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

344
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,957
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

345
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,751
This is who he hires?

346
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,838
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

347
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,758
This is the guy I'd hire.

348
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,838
It's the guy you'd hire.

349
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,313
Look, you remember Emilio?

350
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,512
Okay, this dude got Emlllo off,
like, twlce. Okay?

351
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,077
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

352
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,395
Dude is like Houdini.

353
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,318
Serlously,
when the going gets tough...

354
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:56,271
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

355
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,677
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

356
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,597
Know what I'm saying?

357
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,155
Look, we're In good shape,
Mr. White.

358
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,510
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

359
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,596
Plus, he's scared shltless of me,
all right.

360
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,918
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

361
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,791
And it's only his first dealing rap...

362
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:18,467
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

363
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,069
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

364
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:27,027
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

365
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,673
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

366
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:32,837
Why not?
You look like his typlcal cllentele.

367
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,438


368
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:36,072
Flne.

369
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:39,153
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

370
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,237


371
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,756
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

372
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,954
Mr. Mayhew.

373
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,992
Nice of you to come down. Please.

374
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,389
Look at you.

375
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,428
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

376
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:22,754
Joklng.

377
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,951
In Please, come on.

378
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:26,877
Come on. Please.

379
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,798


380
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,033
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

381
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,189
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

382
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,232
I believe you have
something for me?

383
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,471
Oh, yes.

384
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,151
-Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
-lrlsh.

385
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,079
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

386
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,558
My real name is McGill.

387
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:02,877
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

388
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,958
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

389
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,272
I digress.
Good things are happening.

390
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,155
Fact Is, your nephew |s gonna
get out In no time.

391
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,918
That's wonderful, yeah.

392
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,394
There's still a few details
to be lroned out...

393
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,476
...but now that the DEA
Is Involved...

394
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,230
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probatlon.

395
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,671
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

396
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,437
-Excuse me, the DEA?
-Yeah.

397
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,076
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

398
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:38,074
I hope that l'm not
the breaker of bad news...

399
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,670
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

400
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:42,834
I understand that.

401
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,678
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

402
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,312
They're after some mystery man...

403
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,875
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

404
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,389
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

405
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,431
Seems young Brandon
may have Information...

406
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,392
...that could lead to his arrest.

407
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,831
Jesus, cheer up.
This Is good news.

408
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,473
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

409
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,556
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

410
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:06,711
Wait, wait. Look, ljust.... I think....

411
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,835
I just think that we should
review our options.

412
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,392
Optlons?

413
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,510
l'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

414
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,156
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

415
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,430
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

416
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,153
...and gets his rectum
reslzed about yay blg.

417
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,830
Look, look. What about reprisals?

418
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,758
I mean, if Badger--

419
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,193
If Brandon Informs
on this He|senberg....

420
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,272
I mean, what if, God forbid...

421
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,076
...that they decide to take revenge?

422
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,997
What have you been telling him?

423
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,476
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"If I talk, they'll kill me."

424
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,478
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

425
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:54,197
-Good.
-No, that's not good. That's terr|ble.

426
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:57,357
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

427
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,120
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

428
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,197
Maybe I can work
In some w|tness protectlon.

429
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:05,914
No, look, look.
These are vlclous, desperate people.

430
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:10,874
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

431
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,390
...by crushlng his head
with an ATM machine.

432
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:17,914
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

433
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,429
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

434
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,107
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

435
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,709
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

436
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,117
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

437
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,629
...all's right with the world.

438
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,675
Ten thousand dollars.

439
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,473
Ten thousand, cash to you.

440
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,154
I'm not saying to throw the case.

441
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,229
Just no talking to the DEA.

442
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,434
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

443
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,519
Yes.

444
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,078
What's it going to be?

445
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,710
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

446
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,758
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

447
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,552
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

448
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,112
Threatened to call the police.

449
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,075
-Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
-Like the Exxon Valdez.

450
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,071
So, what do we do about it?

451
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,276
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

452
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,469


453
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,271
For safety.

454
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,959
What?

455
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,512
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

456
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:05,113
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

457
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,790
Come on, just tell me what you want.
JesusI

458
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,990
Oh, no, no, no!

459
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,998
No, It wasn't me.
It was lgnaclo. He's the one.

460
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,839
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

461
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,396
Shut up, dude.

462
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,831
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

463
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,793
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

464
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,392
-Who?
-Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

465
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,034
Oh, lthought....

466
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:38,069
What can I do for you gentlemen?

467
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,589
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

468
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,713
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

469
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,399
You should have taken it.

470
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,558
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

471
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,068
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

472
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,670
The uncle. That was your guy?

473
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,479
No offence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

474
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,910
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

475
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,351
-But I'll take your money! Sure!
-No, that offer has expired, yo.

476
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,314
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

477
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,157
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

478
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,351
l'm easy. l'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

479
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,755
...and assume
this Is just a negotiating tactlc.

480
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,872
All right, listen to me very carefully.

481
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,877
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

482
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:24,071
...the best legal representation ever.

483
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,429
But no deals with the DEA.

484
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:30,154
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

485
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,794
If he does, you're dead.

486
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,034
Why don't you just kill Badger?

487
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,592
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

488
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,871
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

489
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,355
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

490
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,796
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

491
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,272
-We're not killing Badger, yo!
-Then you got real problems, okay.

492
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,391
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

493
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,431
...Iike a proverbial ton of bricks.

494
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,631
I don't think
l'm going out on a limb here...

495
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,558
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prlson.

496
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:09,071
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

497
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,668
Mr. Mayhew?

498
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,750
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

499
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,552


500
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,998
-God.
-Take It easy.

501
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,714
Breathe in, breathe out.

502
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,628
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

503
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,112
That's better.

504
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,276
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

505
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,913
Yeah? How?

506
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,753
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

507
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:54,549
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

508
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,671
So that everything you say
|s strlctly between us.

509
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,631
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

510
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,398
Come on, make it official.

511
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,032
Come on, do It.

512
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:08,912
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

513
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,475
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

514
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,108
-Go on.
-Be smart.

515
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,719
What?

516
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:24,957
-All I got Is a five.
-l'll take a five.

517
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,595
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

518
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,831
Okay, you're now both
offlclally represented...

519
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,552
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

520
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,957
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

521
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,511
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

522
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,237
Just do It.

523
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,911
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table....

524
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,313
And we're sure of that?

525
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,273


526
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,632
All right, all right.

527
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:07,471
The way I see It Is
somebody |s going to prison.

528
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,036
It's just a matter of who.

529
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,557
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

530
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,115
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

531
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,514
Time served, no probation.

532
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,917
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

533
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,074
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

534
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,235
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

535
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:34,511
-...you're going nowhere.
-The tough guy act is unnecessary.

536
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,915
This young man
Is cooperatlng fully.

537
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,917
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperatlng?

538
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,473
Okay, let's start with a name.

539
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,831
He just goes by Heisenberg.

540
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,315
Helsenberg, huh?

541
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,038
How old is this Heisenberg?

542
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,349
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

543
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,596
-He|ght?
-Average, I guess.

544
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,596
Medium height, medium weight.

545
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,678
-What colour halr?
-No halr.

546
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,437
Dude is balder than you.

547
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,915
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

548
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,509
...ls convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

549
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,392
1975, breaking and entering.

550
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,114
1982, grand theft auto.

551
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,549
1984, armed robbery.

552
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:27,911
1987, 1992. You get the Idea.
And here he |s today.

553
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,917
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

554
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:35,399
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

555
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,714
Entire life behind bars.

556
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,349
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

557
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,279
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

558
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,788
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

559
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,510
He's actually
more comfortable Inslde.

560
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,028
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

561
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:57,910
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

562
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,079
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

563
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,996
-So when does all this happen?
-It's already happening.

564
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,427
The buy is set for tomorrow.

565
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,200
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

566
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,278
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

567
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,912
...of your flnest meth.

568
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,035
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

569
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,356
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

570
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,277
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

571
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,835
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

572
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:38,553
Secondly, he gets 30.
Flfty goes to me.

573
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,672
-You get 50? For what?
-For facllltatlng.

574
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,440
Who's taking a bigger r|sk here?
He likes prlson.

575
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,551
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

576
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:49,717
Look, If this option
|s too expensive...

577
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,196
...you can still always...Badger
In the chow l|ne.

578
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:12,750
Conscience gets expenslve,
doesn't It?

579
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,868
All right. There's our boy.

580
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,195
Right on time.

581
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,077
-Go back.
-What? All right, all right, all right.

582
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:09,909
So, what do you think?
They see us?

583
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,116
No, man, I think we're good.

584
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,311
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

585
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,118
Give me those back.

586
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,196
Just give them to me.

587
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,557
Oh, no.

588
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,268
Where the hell is Jimmy?

589
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,390
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

590
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,116
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

591
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,590
There's more
than one kind of prison.

592
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,552
What the hell
Is that supposed to mean?

593
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,114
There he is-- Wait a minute.

594
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,710
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What? What? Let me see.

595
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,315
-Who the hell Is that?
-I don't know.

596
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,713
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

597
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,311
Time to move?

598
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,556
Not till we see the exchange.

599
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,157
No, no. Oh, shit!

600
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,318
-What?
-Now he shows.

601
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,510
Okay, let's do this.

602
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,793


603
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:21,433
Oh, my God.
Jimmy Is on the wrong bench. Crap!

604
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,631
We're screwed!

605
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,158
What are you doing?

606
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,396
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,117
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

608
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,627
Where's the stuff, man?

609
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,876
-Where are we going?
-Just shut up.

610
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,668
Get out. Go stop him.

611
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,189
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

612
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,832
Get out. I'll do something.

613
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:59,950
-What?
-Just go!

614
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,396
Hank, I thought that was you.

615
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,113
Schrader, I'm blocked.

616
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,959
-Walt, not a good time.
-How you doing? You feeling okay?

617
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,115
Schrader, I'm blocked.

618
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,711
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

619
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,117
-Working? Oh, like DEA working?
-Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

620
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:28,275
Is something going down?

621
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,873
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

622
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,469
Wait, Wait.

623
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,715
-Walter, move your ass now.
-Okay.

624
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,638
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

625
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,513
-We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
-Should I back up?

626
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,072
-Go that way.
-Forward |s better?

627
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,031
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

628
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,595
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

629
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:56,267
-l'll leave you alone.
-We'll talk later. Just go.

630
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:59,752
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

631
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,757
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

632
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,994
-Looks like It's going down.
-Take him.

633
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,557
FreezeI Hey, right there.
Don't move.

634
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,233
Come on, let's get him up.

635
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,232
JesusI

636
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,951
I think they bought it.

637
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,549
Absolutely.

638
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,991
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

639
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,633
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

640
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,391
Oh, and Helsenberg's real name?
James Kllkelly.

641
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,553
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

642
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,473
Hey.

643
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:32,828
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys In.

644
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,315
-I hope that's okay.
-Absolutely.

645
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,390
So you bought a bed.

646
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:49,868
Yeah.

647
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:52,077
What is that, a king?

648
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,992
Plllow top?

649
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,473
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

650
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,672
You mlnd?

651
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,716
I was terrible at chemistry.

652
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,434
I'm more of a humanities guy.

653
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,108
-How did you find me?
-We should talk about that.

654
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,471
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

655
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,237
My PI charged me for three hours...

656
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:01,272
...so I seriously doubt
It took him more than one.

657
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,071
So this is, what, blackmail?

658
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:08,917
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

659
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,351
Anything you say to me
Is totally prlvlleged.

660
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,994
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

661
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:18,508
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

662
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:21,711
Especially drug dealers.

663
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,999
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

664
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:29,670
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

665
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,797
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

666
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:37,117
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jellyjar
buried in the side yard?

667
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,152
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

668
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,588
...but he won't be the last.

669
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,190
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

670
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,753
I don't understand.

671
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,712
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

672
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:54,071
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vlto Corleone?

673
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:57,437
I'm no Vito Corleone.

674
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,279
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

675
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:01,912
But with some sound advice...

676
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,395
...and the proper Introductlons,
who knows?

677
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,477
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

678
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:09,318
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

679
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,111
...you're on to something special.

680
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:15,517
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of It.

681
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,989
Food for thought, yeah?

682
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:28,470
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make...

683
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,676
...better call SaulI
