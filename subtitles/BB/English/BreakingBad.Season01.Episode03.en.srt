1
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,512
Let's break it down.

2
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,794
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

3
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,672
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

4
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,871
Slxty-thru?

5
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,432
That I: a blg blte.

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,632
-My next step's gotta be oxygen.
-Oxygen, 26 percent.

7
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:01,909
Twenty-le.
There you have your water.

8
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,350
-Carbon, 9 percent.
-Carbon, 9.

9
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:08,357
-For a total of 98 percent.
-nght.

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,633
-Nltrogen, 1.25 percent.
-0ne-polnt-two-flve.

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,035
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.

12
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,073
Which on|y leaves you
with the trace elements...

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,714
...down where the magic happens.

14
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:24,514
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,438
Got a whole skeleton to account for.

16
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,231
-You would think, right?
-nght.

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,830
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.

18
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,551
What? That low? Seriously?

19
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,397
Damn, I never would've thought that.

20
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,195
-0kay, so where does Iron flt In?
-lron.

21
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,952
Well, okay, 0.00004 percent.

22
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,875
What? You can't have
haemoglobin wlthout Iron.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,799
-Apparently, it don't take much.
-No doubt. Go figure.

24
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:00,674
-Sodlum.
-Sodlum, 0.04.

25
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,309
-Phoaphorua, 0.19.
-Polnt-one-n|ne.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,353
There we go.

27
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:13,195
So the whole thing...

28
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:19,554
...adds up to 99.888042 percent.

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,280
We are 0.111958 percent...

30
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,507
...ahy.

31
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,189
-Suppoaedly, that's everything.
-Yeah?

32
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,238
I don't know, l]uat....

33
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,835
It seem: like aomethlng'a mlaalng,
doesn't It?

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,829
There's got to be more
to a human being than that.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,558
I hate these shoes.

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,354
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans...

37
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,311
...like I should be squeaking around...

38
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,987
...brlnglng soup to some
dlaguatlng old person...

39
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,076
...then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,396
Then why are you wearing them?

41
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,710
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

42
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,153
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,076
I gotta go take this.

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,678
Female?

45
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,796
Louls.

46
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,309
Not like It's any
of your business, though.

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,397
-Just be quick about It.
-No.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,798
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo."

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,639
You can't know how much I hate that.

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,070
You missed a spot, right there.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,879
Should you be on that ladder?

52
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,435
You're more than welcome
to take over for me in here.

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,756
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do It.

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,033
Yeah, there's an idea.

55
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,837
So I'm working on
this new short story...

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,431
...and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to....

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,716
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,233
You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

59
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,792
I mean, you at least tried it.

60
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,556
Come on.

61
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,319
l perhaps tried it. Why?

62
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,714
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

63
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,910
Like, changing it in any major way?

64
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,636
It made me more serious.

65
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,432
Really?

66
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,714
Because I mostly remember it made me
light-headed, that's about it.

67
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,473
l was Just wondering
If It maybe could....

68
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,512
You know, it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

69
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,678
-Walter Jr.'s on pot?
-What? No.

70
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,471


71
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,114
-What would make you even--?
-Where's he getting it?

72
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,629
-Marle.
-Serlously. Is It thls Lou|s person?

73
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,998
-What are you gonna do about this?
-Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

74
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,908
lam strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

75
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,479
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. Is not on pot...

76
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,398
...certainly not as far as I know.

77
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,956
Not as far as you know?

78
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,953
Marie.

79
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,517
Hey, look at me.

80
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:41,155
Hey, turn around and look at me.

81
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:49,228
This here.

82
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,274
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

83
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,071
This Is degradlng.

84
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,232
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,112
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

86
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,271
But I won't.

87
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,789
So either kill me, or let me go.

88
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,434
You don't have it in you, Walter.

89
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,991
How do you know my name?

90
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,359
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

91
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,508
I came by to sell your meth.

92
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,996
So what? You threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

93
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,111
Not even close.

94
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,636
What else did he tell you?

95
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,594
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

96
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,949
You were his high school teacher.

97
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,070
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide...

98
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,713
...by making grape soda in class.

99
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,988
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

100
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,232
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

101
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:04,509
That partner of yours...

102
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:05,788
...he's got a big mouth.

103
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,191
Walter...

104
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,754
...I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

105
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,551
...but trust me...

106
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,753
...this line of work doesn't suit you.

107
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,875
So I should just let you go, then.

108
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,392
Just unlock you and...adios, huh?

109
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,234
I don't see
what other choice you have.

110
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,159
lt's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

111
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,318


112
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,356
...your real problem's
slttlng upstalrs.

113
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,553
Occupled.

114
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,627
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off
In here.

115
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,795
Just give me some prlvacy,
would you?

116
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,467
-0kay.
-What the hell, man?

117
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,237
What are you doing, man?

118
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:13,589
-You asshole. What--?
-You told him my name.

119
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,790
-Says who, him?
-My name, where I work.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,275
-You told him about my son.
-Hey, don't touch me.

121
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,948
-You damn junkle.
-No, give me that. That's mlne.

122
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,195
This Is going down the toilet.
Watch It go.

123
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,833
No, that's worth 40 grand, you--

124
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,634
It's worth nothing
when you smoke It all.

125
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,716
Get off the toilet.

126
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,637
-Get off the toilet!
-No.

127
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,552
Get off the toilet.

128
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,916
Stop It.

129
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,479
No. No way.

130
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,794


131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,877


132
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,993
Back off, man, Jesus.

133
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,599
-We've got work to do.
-No, no.

134
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,189
You got work to do. I did my part.

135
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,754
You mean that obscenity
I spent hours cleaning up?

136
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,712
-That Is your contribution?
-K|ss my plnk ass, man.

137
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,070
I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

138
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,747
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

139
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,917
Because you dIdn't follow
my Instructions.

140
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,758
Oh, well, He” Hitler, bitch.

141
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,109
And let me tell you something else.

142
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,993
We flipped a coin, okay?

143
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,634
You and me. You and me.

144
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,034
Coln fllp Is sacred.

145
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,314
Your job Is waiting for you
In that basement...

146
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,635
...as per the coin.

147
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,272
Fucking do it, already.

148
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,473
That's what she said. Yeah.

149
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,709
Yeah. Yeah, lthlnk
we have some of those.

150
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,276
-Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
-Hello?

151
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,834
-Seven and a half, maybe. I don't know.
-Excuse me.

152
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,392
Do you have these in black?

153
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,392
Anyways, so like I was saying...

154
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:45,796
...I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.

155
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,708
Whatever.

156
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,434
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

157
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,995
Sorry, baby, I'm klnd of busy here.
What's up?

158
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,239
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

159
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,070
-So I need you to focus, and--
-Hey, sIt downI SIt downI

160
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,270
Damn It, Hank.

161
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,119
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle
of something here.

162
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,072
Get down. Get down.

163
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,829
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
comprende? You too, sit down!

164
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,995
I'm back, babe. What's up?

165
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,397
-Walter Jr.
-Yeah, what about Mm?

166
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,037
Marijuana. He's smoking it.

167
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,310
Excuse me, hIs own mother
seems to thInk so.

168
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,350
-Skyler told you that?
-She Inferred It.

169
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,787
She inferred it, huh?

170
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,671
She strongly inferred it.

171
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,193
Like, "Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

172
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,878
-PIease, come on.
-All right.

173
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,116
-Talk to him.
-WaIt should talk to NM.

174
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,197
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.

175
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,390
I think it ought to be you.

176
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,511
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

177
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,314
Maybe show him
some autopsy plctures.

178
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,271
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

179
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,716
I don't know, baby,
It's just that, you know...

180
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,956
...I figure his dad should be the one
doing this, don't you think?.

181
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,309
Hank, he respects you.

182
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,275
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, yeah,
l'll swing by their place after work.

183
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,073
-Good. Scare hlm straight.
-Yeah, yeah.

184
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,792
Hey, where's my sugar?

185
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,988


186
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,273
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

187
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,313
I'm extremely clean.

188
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,397
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.

189
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,149
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

190
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,435
You know, I bid a paIr for you
last week, grey ones.

191
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,397
-What do you think?
-About what?

192
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,787
This look like a nice place?

193
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,676
No, not really.

194
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,791
Think you'd like to live here?

195
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,712


196
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,672
-Sure about that?
-Yeah, pretty sure.

197
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,838
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

198
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,473
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a lIttle detour.

199
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,591
Figure we'll come over
and check out how the other half lives.

200
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,189
This here Is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

201
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,038
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

202
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,909
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads...

203
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,908
...who'd sell their grandma's coochle
for a hit.

204
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,474
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

205
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,875
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these...

206
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,198
...mlserable wastes of skin
got started how?

207
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,515
-How do you think they started?
-I don't know.

208
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:21,392
What do you think they were doing
before they graduated...

209
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:24,159
...to shooting meth in their dicks?

210
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,477
A gateway drug.

211
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,317
That's what we call it.

212
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,749
Dollars to doughnuts,
and l shit you not...

213
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,668
...that gateway drug was marijuana,
every time.

214
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,791
-You understand?
-Yeah.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,912
So why are you telling me this?

216
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:43,633
Because I love you,
you lIttle bastard.

217
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,799
And, hey, I was young once,
you know.

218
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:50,438
The world's a messed up place,
you know.

219
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,837
You know, just this one time,
you know....

220
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,918
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

221
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,829
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.

222
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,834
Hey, don't make me

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,307
Check this out.

224
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,475

225
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:16,828
-I ain't holdlng, okay?
-Dld I say open your mouth?

226
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,836
And hands off the car.

227
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,757
Other side. Go around the other side,
talk to my friend here.

228
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,596
What's your name, sweetheart?

229
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,478
-Wendy.
-Wendy, huh?

230
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,715
How much you charge
for a wIndy, Wendy?

231
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,997
-I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
-Jesus, was that my question?

232
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,839
Don't think so hard,
It's gonna hurt your brain.

233
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,792
-Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
-Nothing. Neither.

234
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:44,069
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

235
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,033
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whltes.

236
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,468
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.

237
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,237
Big time, big time on the pipe.

238
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,431
You got something
you wanna ask Wendy?

239
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,152
No, not really.

240
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,396
You ever smoke anything else,
Wendy?

241
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,029
Sausages don't count.

242
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,436
Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

243
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:11,268
Probably used to be, what? Like a
Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.

244
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,359
-What are you, like, handicapped?
-He broke his leg playing football.

245
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,075
He's a qb. Got an arm like a howitzer.

246
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,119
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?

247
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,388
Why, you got some?

248
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,114
No. nght, hoof It, get lost.
Get out of here.

249
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,437
Hey, falr warnlng, next time
I'm gonna bust you.

250
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:38,867
So, what do you think?

251
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,995
Cool.

252
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,430
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock It. Lock It, lock It.

253
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:56,388
Who the hell was that?

254
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,239
Cop and some football player
messing with me.

255
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,590
They ask about me, huh?

256
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,198
No, I think they just wanted pot.

257
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,152
nght there.

258
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,714
Shit, I left my root beer.

259
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,831
-HeIIo?
-Hey, sweetIe, It's me.

260
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,757
LIsten, I'm so sorry.

261
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,954
Time, It just completely got away
from me. I'm just....

262
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,714
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late...

263
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,387
...you know, doing some inventory...

264
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,068
...and I should've just--

265
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,194
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."

266
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,311
But....

267
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,948
Sky? You there?

268
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,310
You're at the car wash?

269
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,797
Yeah.

270
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,350
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.

271
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,474
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

272
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,990
Quite an earful he gave me.

273
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,712
Llsten....

274
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,436
LIsten, I'll come home
and we'll talk about It.

275
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,274
-I don't think so, Walt.
-Honey....

276
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,391
Wherever you are...

277
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,113
...why don't you just
stay there tonight?

278
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,952
Skyler?

279
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,590
Walter?

280
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,358
Hello?

281
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,233
Hey, there's a hungry guy here.

282
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,391
Come on.

283
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,477


284
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,235
I didn't think you were coming back.

285
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,512
How long was I out?

286
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,312
Ten, 15 minutes?

287
00:23:57,239 --> 00:24:00,709
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

288
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,875
Were you on the same shit
you used on me?

289
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,838
I've got lung cancer.

290
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,994
I'll make you another sandwich.

291
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,117
It's safe.

292
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,991
There's no polson.

293
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,075
Because that would be
the way to do It...

294
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,710
...If you're gonna do It.

295
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,076
I suppose It would.

296
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,267
You being a chemist and all.

297
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,513
So that name...

298
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,990
...Krazy-0.

299
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,315
Do I really have to call you that?

300
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,987
I mean, no offence, but...

301
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,397
...don't you have a real name?

302
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,272


303
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,912


304
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,758
That's "Sunday," right?

305
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,835
I'd rather call you that,
If you don't mind.

306
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,954
I can't say I ever liked it much.

307
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:29,917


308
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,795
...you from around town here
or someplace else?

309
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,076
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me...

310
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,191
...Is not gonna make It easIer
for you to kIll me.

311
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,392
Not that l mind, you understand?

312
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:47,235
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

313
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,032
Well, maybe.

314
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,316
But maybe not.

315
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,954
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

316
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,435
I mean, any good reason at all.

317
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,351


318
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,516
Tell me what it is.

319
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,308
I'd start off by promising
that If you let me go...

320
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,716
...I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

321
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,831
I guess I'd say
what happened between us...

322
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,069
...never happened.

323
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,794
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

324
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,990
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

325
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,474
And, In my case,
they happen to be true.

326
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,078
You'll never know for sure.

327
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,030
So, what else can I tell you?

328
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,477
I don't know.

329
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,233
But you've gotta convince me.

330
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,834
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

331
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:01,229
-Hey, yeah.
-Yeah.

332
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,589
I'm from here in town, man.

333
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,794
ABQ, born and bred.

334
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,830
Never left.

335
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,556
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM...

336
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,908
...got my degree.

337
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,711
Really?

338
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,629
Does that come In handy
In the drug trade?

339
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,558
Doesn't hurt.

340
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,999
l was gonna study music originally.

341
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,078
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

342
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,396
My pops talked me out of it.

343
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,308
Said there was no money in it unless
lwind up some bullshit rock star...

344
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,353
...and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

345
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,430
What does your dad do?

346
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,591
He owns Tamplco Furnlture
over on Menaul.

347
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,107
Wait a minute, I know that place.

348
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,357
Wait a minute. That's....

349
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,834
That's that....

350
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,314
They used to have those late-night--

351
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,670
-The stupld commercials.
-That they had, yeah.

352
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:06,871
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.

353
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,594
Wait a minute.
How dId It go? It was....

354
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,513
Wait, wait, wait. It was....

355
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,037
Don't let shopplng
Straln your braIn-o

356
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,789
Just sing this short refrain-o

357
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:26,036
-Our furnlture Is bueno
-Our furnlture Is bueno

358
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:29,675
-Tamplco Is the name-o
-Tamplco Is the name-o

359
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,712
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

360
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:46,468
Well, It dId tend
to stick In your head.

361
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,274
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

362
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,268
Oh, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

363
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,630
He sings It at bars,
trying to pIck up on women.

364
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,948
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven."'

365
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,958
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, l....

366
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,110
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

367
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,357
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a speciality item.

368
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:16,708
We did use to sell cribs.

369
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:21,313
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

370
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,555
Yeah. No, I remember that.

371
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:29,550
In fact, I remember recognising
your dad from those commercials.

372
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,035
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

373
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:35,070
Yeah. No shlt.

374
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,668
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

375
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,037
Yeah, he probably did.

376
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,514
And I was probably dumb enough
to buy It.

377
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,551
Yeah, that was his big thing.

378
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,317
You ask him for a glass of water...

379
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,352
...he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

380
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,508
-Dld you work there too?
-0nly my whole life.

381
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,508
Up until the day I said,
'Fuck you,' and quIt.

382
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,351


383
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,718
...16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

384
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,878
If It was after school,
trust me, I was there.

385
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,030
Might have even helped ring you up.

386
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,788
You and your extended warranty
on the crIb.

387
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,036
Small world.

388
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,151
It Is.

389
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,948
The paths we take, huh?

390
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,789
Jesse know you've got cancer?

391
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,595
No one but you.

392
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,678
-Not your family?
-No.

393
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,959
Why not?

394
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,236
Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

395
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,391
That's why you're cooking meth?

396
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,548
You wanna leave money
for your family.

397
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,152


398
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,038
I'll write you a cheque right now
If you let me go.

399
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,590
Like I said, Walter...

400
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:48,037
...If this line of work
doesn't suit you...

401
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,754
...get out before it's too late.

402
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,189
I don't know what to do.

403
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,114
You do.

404
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,589
I'll get the key.

405
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,991


406
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,037


407
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,789
Oh, no, no, no.

408
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,309
No. No, don't do this.

409
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,636
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

410
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:38,839
Why are you doing this?

411
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,710
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

412
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,316
Do you wanna...?

413
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,189
So you're not angry?

414
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:43,510
Angry at you?

415
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,914
Live and let live, man.

416
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,109
That's very understanding.

417
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,072
Whatever, man.

418
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,316
I just wanna go home.

419
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,672
Me too.

420
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,155
Unlock me, Walter.

421
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,315
The moment I do...

422
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,673
...are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

423
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,032
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

424
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,991
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

425
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,839
I'm sorry.

426
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,431
I'm sorry.

427
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,835
I'm so sorry.

428
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,758
Hello?

429
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,949
Anybody down here?

430
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,591
Everybody...

431
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,034
...I need you all to take your seats.

432
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,913
Settle down, please. Thank you.

433
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,758
I understand
that Mr. White Is feellng...

434
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,427
...a lIttle under the weather
this morning.

435
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:14,394
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

436
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:18,672
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video...

437
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,190
...on carbon.

438
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,588
Very important stuff.

439
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:30,395
-So, what do you think?
-lt's a cook sIte. Gotta be.

440
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,717
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

441
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,559
Flre there could have started
by accident.

442
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:39,148
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evldence.

443
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,037
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

444
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:46,356
So, what, they're In
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

445
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:49,471
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

446
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,271
Yeah. Why not?

447
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:54,437
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

448
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,350
-Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
-lt's a rich and vibrant culture.

449
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,709
It's a car that jumps up and down.

450
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,309
What the hell?

451
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,511
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

452
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:13,632
Smells like a Drakkar Nolr
factory In here.

453
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,518
I already searched it.

454
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,757
Yeah.

455
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,551
You're wasting your time.

456
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,233
Give It up. If this here's a trap car,
It's gonna take more...

457
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,999
-...than your dumb white ass to find It.
-0h, yeah?

458
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,987
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

459
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,394
I'm Rain Man countlng
hls toothplcks.

460
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,348
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

461
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:45,032
Yeah, baby.

462
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,513
-Hello, zlppy.
-Asshole.

463
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,035
Sort of looks like meth
but It's too damn whlte.

464
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,152
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

465
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,953
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

466
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,559
Hey, agent.

467
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,512
You got something?

468
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:41,630
I don't know.

469
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,909
It just-- Doesn't it seem like...

470
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,634
...something's missing?

471
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,835
What about the soul?

472
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:03,189
The soul.

473
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:13,157
There's nothing but chemistry here.

474
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,357
Skyler?

475
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,274
There's something I have to tell you.
