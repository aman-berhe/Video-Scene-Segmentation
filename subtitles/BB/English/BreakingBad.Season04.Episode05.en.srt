1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,672
Say you understand.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,438
You understand?

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,233
Tell me you understand, Saul!

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,112
Every dollar.
If you don't hear from me in 24 hours--

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,598
No, look. Shut-- Saul. Saul, shut up.
Shut up and listen to me.

6
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,588
I want you to give her every dollar.
I don't care if you stuff it in trash bags.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,349
Just make sure she gets everything.
All right? Just make it happen.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,799
Hi. You've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,640
Hay. It's me.

10
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,507


11
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,952
I just wanted to say that l was thinking
about you and the kids, and....

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,518
I love you.

13
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,947
...to try our breakfast chicken chalupa
combo meal?

14
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,388
Gus Frlng.

15
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,635
Excuse me?

16
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:49,673
Gustavo Frlng, your boss, now.
Please.

17
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,473
-Mr. Frlng Isn't here right now. Is"?
-He': hare.

18
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,955
HI: car I: parked out front.
Ho's hare.

19
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,592
He was here. Mr. Fring was--

20
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,553
You just go in the back and you tell him
it's Walter White. Understand?

21
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,911
He'll know what it's about.

22
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,471
I'll wait.

23
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,516
Yeah, let me get a chalupa special.

24
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,714
Hallo?

25
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,991
Walter, what exactly are you doing?

26
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,474
Where I: Jun?

27
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,715
Jesse's with me. He's fine.

28
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,875
What, do you expect me
to Just believe that?

29
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,115
I'm crossing my heart, Walter.

30
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,470
-Where I: he?
-Hold on.

31
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,597
-Yo.
-Jeue?

32
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,073
Yeah. What's up?

33
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,034
-Jeue, where are you?
-Wlth Mlke.

34
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,551
I know you're with Mike.

35
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,148
Are you all right?
Does he have a gun on you?

36
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,158


37
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,874
What's going on, then?

38
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,548
-We're drlvlng.
-Drlvlng.

39
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,873
Drlvlng where?

40
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,477
I don't know.

41
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,948
North.

42
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,229
Why I: he driving you?
Where I: he going?

43
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,078
Beat: me.

44
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,115
ldon't-- Put Mike back on.

45
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,952


46
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,231
Mike,
tell me now exactly what I: going on.

47
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,429
Jesse's with me today.

48
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,915
So, what you need to do is go back
to your lab and get on with the cook.

49
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,588
You're gonna have
to muddle through this without him.

50
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,394
-That's what's going on.
-But It doesn't--

51
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,397
-Goodbye, Walter.
-Mlke--

52
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,633
Slr.

53
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,559
Excuse me. Hey.
You're not allowed back there.

54
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,794
Excuse me, sir.

55
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,235
As I said, sir, Mr. Fring is not here.
This area is for employees only.

56
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,034
l have to ask
that you leave Immediately.

57
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,753
What you told Mr. White, that's....

58
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,878
It's just bullshit, right?

59
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,828
What, you figure on just leaving me
in some ditch?

60
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,158
What do you care?

61
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,870
I don't.

62
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,593
But I'll tell you now,
you better shoot straight, old man...

63
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,235
...or I'll sllce off your other ear
before this Is over.

64
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,953
You comlng?

65
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:46,796
We gotta do this six more times today
with a lot of miles in between.

66
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,832
I'd like to finish before dark.

67
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,358
This freaking guy, I tell you what.

68
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,712
It's like Scarface had sex
with Mr. Rogers or something.

69
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,479
Who does this, you know?

70
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,954
Your boy Heisenberg,
thought we had him already.

71
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,911
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

72
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,395
Yeah, no.
Getz busted him a few months back.

73
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,875
Yeah, well, no offence
to Detective Doogie Howser there...

74
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,996
...but all he caught was a dipshit lifer
by the name of Jimmy ln-'N-Out.

75
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,430
This one, he's your Heisenberg?

76
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,592
Yeah, I believe he ls.

77
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,950
So, what are you thinking? Rival
drug gang taking out the mastermind?

78
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,755
Any names I should check out?

79
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,517
lwish I could help you there.

80
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,836
Only two people I know
connected with the blue stuff.

81
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,600
One Is a beanie-wearing
jlzz-staln...

82
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,031
...by the name of Brandon Mayhew,
street name "Badger."

83
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,674
Definitely not a player.

84
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,677
And the other one...

85
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,755
...is Jesse Pinkman.

86
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,990
He and l have a history.

87
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,679
Yeah.

88
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,917
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

89
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,638
That would surprise me.

90
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,832
Well, we have a composite
of a person of Interest.

91
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,748
It's a guy the neighbours saw
at Boetticher's place...

92
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,870
...right after the shooting.

93
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:48,112
-Yeah. Sorry.
-No, hang on to It, just In case.

94
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,753
We got a couple of prints
we're hoping to ID.

95
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,871
If I get any kind of hit,
I'll keep you in the loop on that.

96
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,274
You know...

97
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,753
...Tlm, look,
I appreciate what you're doing, really...

98
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,712
...you know,
keeping me Involved and all...

99
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,831
...but, you know, finding this guy
Heisenberg dead like this...

100
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,396
...l have to say, It...

101
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,671
...kind of feels like closure to me.

102
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,589
Hank, you really are a big help here.

103
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,279
No, I know. I get it, really.

104
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,119
But I'm done.

105
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,709
You don't need to do that.

106
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,953
This is why I'm out here, right?

107
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,355
To be, like, your backup?

108
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,798
So If I'm out here
In a guard-type capacity...

109
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:42,629
...to watch over the money,
that means I need, like, a gun, right?

110
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,318


111
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,593
I mean, isn't that, like, idiotic
for me to be out here without a gun?

112
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,109
You haven't saId dick
about what I'm doing here.

113
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,151
Now I'm supposed to do It
without a gun?

114
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,669
How does that even make sense?

115
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,314
What? I can smoke, right?

116
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,355
Not a chance.

117
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,759
It's finally hitting me
what the plan Is here.

118
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,872
It's to bore me to death...

119
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:49,189
...so mission accomplished
because it's totally working.

120
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,471
Great job.

121
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,828
...wlth all the dead drops
and bags of cash.

122
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:06,432
Me and my boys had the exact same
system when l was running things.

123
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:07,958
My crew.

124
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,231
Nowhere near the same cheese
you guys are slinging, but same theory.

125
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,035
You know, maintain separation
between dealer and supplier...

126
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,150
...reduce risk...

127
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,551
...et cetera.

128
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,638
Look, don't you think it'd be good if
there was some communication here?

129
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,798
You got me riding shotgun
to every dark anal recess in the state.

130
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:33,194
Be nice if you clued me in a little.

131
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,587
I mean, I'm here to do a job, right?

132
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,633
And, I mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy...

133
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,196
...then you should just tell me
what the hell Is up.

134
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,393
-What?
-You are not the guy.

135
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,149
You're not capable of being the guy.
I had a guy, but now I don't.

136
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,272
You are not the guy.

137
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,673
-Then what the hell am I doing here?
-I don't know.

138
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,347
It's not my call. I just do what I'm told.

139
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,711
And now you're gonna do
what you're told, which is to sit here...

140
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,788
...shut up, and stay in the car
till we finish our pickups. You got it?

141
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,150
-We having second thoughts?
-Every hour of every day.

142
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,953
Let me tell you,
that Is perfectly normal.

143
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,036
But your expectations are realistic.

144
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:15,993
You have a good, solid business plan.
I'm feeling very confident.

145
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:18,474
You have an excellent shot
at making this work.

146
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:23,152
Walt?

147
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,111
Are you good?

148
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,078
Yeah.

149
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,032
All right.

150
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:48,349
Well, my congratulations
to the both of you.

151
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,391
Thank you very much, Alan.

152
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,750
It Is my pleasure.

153
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,037
Mr. White.

154
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,634
-Best of luck.
-Thank you.

155
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,196
I'm bringing the car over first thing
next week for a wash and wax.

156
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,595
-We'll be looking for you.
-l'll be there.

157
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,358
-Thank you again.
-You're welcome.

158
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,356
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

159
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,070
It's official.

160
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,034
How are you feeling?

161
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,398


162
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,472
Well, l'm-- How do you feel?

163
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,391
Nervous.

164
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,271
Scared.

165
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,112
This is a big step, Walt.

166
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,310
If we don't do this right--

167
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,794
We'll be fine.

168
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,719
We will?

169
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,599
Tell me again.

170
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,671
We will be fine. Believe it.

171
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,509
If we're gonna do this,
I mean, really gonna do this...

172
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,393
...then we have
to promise each other...

173
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,471
...no more secrets.

174
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,671
There can't be any mistakes
like before.

175
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:17,518
There has to be complete honesty.

176
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,997
I'm all for that.

177
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,873


178
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:25,470
Well, then...

179
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,035
...how about a drink to celebrate?

180
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,037
-Well--
-Well, we own a blg-ass car wash now.

181
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:33,958
We do.
I guess that merits a celebration.

182
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,387
Nothing too expensive.

183
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,036
-nght. Right. Non-fancy liquor It Is.
-Yes.

184
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:42,151
Just as long as it gets the job done.

185
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,475
it's me.

186
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,117
ljust wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and....

187
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,511
i love you.

188
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,388
-0kay.
-0kay.

189
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,797
-Just take It off. Just take It off.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

190
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,191
The sheets,
they smell different than I remember.

191
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:57,392
Don't they?

192
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,114
New fabric softener.

193
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,636
Yeah, I like It.

194
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,796
I also got a new haircut.

195
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,389
-Don't know if you--
-Oh, yes, I was gonna say something.

196
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,068
Were you, really?

197
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,396
I do like It.

198
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,432
Thanks.

199
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,999


200
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:31,470
...dinner tomorrow night?

201
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,194
I told Marie that we'd come over
and eat with them.

202
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,033
Think maybe you'll be free?

203
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,238
Yeah.

204
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,474
Yeah, we can do that. That'll be nice.

205
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,079


206
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:58,157
Marie says it's about the only thing
that'll get Hank out of his room.

207
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,276
Mom?

208
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,036
-Hey, Mom? Dad?
-Hey, son.

209
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,030
Where are you?

210
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,710
We're back here.
We'll be out In a minute.

211
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,190
Oh, God.

212
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,549
-Serlously?
-l'm parked In the driveway.

213
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,310
This is going to make for some
very interesting dinner conversation.

214
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,516
He is definitely gonna ask
about our living situation now.

215
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,351
Maybe....

216
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,113
Maybe you should move back in.

217
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,915
You know, just so It's easIer
to explain to everyone.

218
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,471
You think?

219
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,150
l have to get back to work.

220
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,829
You know, schedule.

221
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,597
Yeah.

222
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,272
Damn It.

223
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,628
Heyl

224
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,310
Heyi This is a two-man job.
i can't do it alone.

225
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,554
i'm done. That's it.

226
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,149
Finished. Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

227
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,358
Jesse?

228
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,431
Where Is Jesse?

229
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:18,437
I need him.
You people have me down here...

230
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:22,029
...trying to complete
a two-man operation by myself.

231
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:26,152
lt's unacceptable.
lt's dangerous and counterproductive.

232
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,593
Jesse operates the forklift, not me.

233
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,632
That's one of the many, many things
he does around the lab...

234
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,035
...that keeps us on schedule,
so I suggest...

235
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:38,628
...that you get him back
down here as soon as you--

236
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,989
Are you listening to me?

237
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,155
Hello?

238
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,835
Where do you want it?

239
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,555
This is it, right? Last stop?

240
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,351
Last stop?

241
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:30,230
Hey, I've been counting, yo.
No more pickups after--

242
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,232
Yeah.
I'm gonna need to be picked up. Now.

243
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,191
Garcia's on Central. Honk once.
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

244
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,074
Cancel that.

245
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,032
Hey, this dude--

246
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:04,027
This dude was coming right at me
with a shotgun.

247
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:08,027
They blocked the alley and they were
gonna rip us off. I didn't have a choice.

248
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:13,267
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car, and just--

249
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,831


250
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,392
You saw.

251
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,799
Jesus.

252
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,757
I just--

253
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,997
I don't know.

254
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:34,155


255
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,037


256
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,518
Morning.

257
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,789
Hey. Good morning, son.

258
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,110
You want me
to pour you some juice?

259
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,273
I'll take a coffee.

260
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,075
Didn't know
you started drinking coffee.

261
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:33,911
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces too, all by myself.

262
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,395
Go grab a mug.

263
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,835
Milk? Sugar?

264
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,230
Just black.

265
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:50,953
Black. I like It.

266
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,116
Hey, Dad, I just gotta say....

267
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,439
I just wanted to say
It's really cool to have you here.

268
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,518
Thank you, son.

269
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,994
It's cool to be back home.

270
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,071
It just feels....

271
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:14,318
Mom saId you're moving back In
this Tuesday.

272
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,952
Shem?

273
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,117
She saId that?

274
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,958
Yeah.

275
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,436
Tuesday, Is It?

276
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,716
How about that?

277
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,752
Jesse. Jesse.

278
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:00,073
Yo, what's up?

279
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,871
What are you doing?

280
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,989
-Break|ng Ice.
-I mean, what are you doing here?

281
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,589
-Where's your car?
-M|ke dropped me off.

282
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,552
Jesse.

283
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,710
Jessel

284
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,076
What happened yesterday?
Where were you?

285
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:30,509
l was out with Mike,
helped him make pickups.

286
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,631
-Plck|ng up what?
-Cash. Dead drops.

287
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,354
Mlke made the pickups
and l guarded him.

288
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,072
You...

289
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,469
...guarded Mlke?

290
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,669
What Is this, a joke?

291
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,837
Hey, know what? Two dudes tried
to rob us and I saved the stash.

292
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,192
I took care of business, just like
I'm taking care of business right now.

293
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,154
You wanna stand there dicking around,
or you wanna suit up and get to work?

294
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,629
Get in gear, yo, because I'm
meeting up with Mike this afternoon.

295
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,558
What, again? Why?

296
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,593
Guess I have two jobs now.

297
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,878
Los Poiios Hermanos,
can i take your order?

298
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,234
Any Injuries?

299
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:34,749
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

300
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,636
It all went like you thought it would,
more or less.

301
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,148
lwill, of course, reimburse you
for the damage to your vehicles.

302
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,397
Questions?

303
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:51,189
More than a few, yeah.

304
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,152
But I know better than to ask.

305
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,672
Anyway...

306
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,190
...just like you wanted.

307
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,595
The kld's a hero.

308
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:21,670
Just the idea of owning a car wash
seems so daunting, but I have to....

309
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,156
Who is just the most beautiful little girl
in the world? You.

310
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,874
So coming Into a business
that's up and running...

311
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,196
...fully operational,
puts us way ahead of the game.

312
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,789
We're gonna still have some
changeover time.

313
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,399
We'll have to hire some people.

314
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,989
But we do have a staff In place,
so, you know...

315
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:41,191
...we'll be able to hold on
to most of Bogdan's employees.

316
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,631
We might lose a few
to the UltraWash across town, though.

317
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,990
They're making a grab, I hear.

318
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,235
-Gonna put the kid to work?
-l've got school.

319
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:53,318
Not you. I'm talking about your baby
sister. I wouldn't let you near my car.

320
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:55,715
Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.

321
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:58,270
You should put Holly on the sign.

322
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,917
-lee a mascot?
-lee the Gerber baby.

323
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,237
I would get my car washed there
if I saw her face out front.

324
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,394
What about me?

325
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,229
The goal is to bring customers in,
not scare them away, so....

326
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,037
Walt, there's another bottle
in the kitchen. Just help yourself.

327
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,639


328
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,874
Maybe we could roll Uncle Hank
through the car wash.

329
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,229
He could be the first customer.

330
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,591
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

331
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,512
I got your wipe-down right here.

332
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,712
Hank, can we get through one meal
without you grabbing your crotch?

333
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,469
So, what are you gonna do with Holly?
You can't take her to work...

334
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:42,388
...with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

335
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,672
-Marle--
-What? That can't be safe.

336
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,394
Fortunately, fIve minutes
from the car wash...

337
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,831
...there Is the top child-care centre
In the city.

338
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,076
The National Child Care Association
gives it high ratings.

339
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:59,716
So that's a huge relief and, you know,
we could walk there if we had to.

340
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,869
Sky, I gotta tell you, I'm just--
I'm really, really impressed.

341
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,155
You came together on this.
I'm happy that it's working out for you.

342
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,715
It's been a little scary,
but it needed to be done.

343
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,911
And we get possession of the keys
tomorrow.

344
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,633
Oh, that's awesome.

345
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,116
I can't wait to see what kind of car
I'm going to get for my birthday...

346
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,071
...now with all this money rolling in.

347
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:25,998
You've been spending too much time
around your Uncle Hank.

348
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,952
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Right, Uncle Hank?

349
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,038
Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

350
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,995
Hey, Nick the Greek,
you gonna share that bottle or what?

351
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,427
Yeah. Sorry.

352
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,993
Who's Nick the Greek?

353
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,155
He's a famous big-time card player.

354
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,759
Hank, that's not funny.

355
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,268
-What? It's a compliment.
-That's even worse, then.

356
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:47,717
You're glvlng
positive reinforcement...

357
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,038
...to behaviour that Walt
is working very, very hard to change.

358
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,151
-nght, Skyler?
-Yeah.

359
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,351
I don't see how it's bad.
Dad's raking in the beaucoup bucks.

360
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,950
You know, I just think
maybe we could change the subject?

361
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,799
Yeah. Sure. You know. Absolutely.

362
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,719
Hey, Uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at...

363
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,354
...with that crazy singing guy?

364
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,792
I'm off that. I gave my assessment
to A.P.D. I'm done.

365
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:19,388
The case of the crazy singing guy.

366
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,351
Sounds like
an Encyclopedia Brown story.

367
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,189
Crazy is the wrong word.

368
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,553
This guy, Gale Boetticher,
he was eccentric.

369
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,232
A real character, you know?
He's dead now.

370
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,912
-Who was he?
-He was a meth cook.

371
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,997
He was a meth chef.

372
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,319
I mean, we're talking five stars.
Candles and white tablecloth.

373
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,909
Hey, I can't believe these words
are gonna come out of my mouth...

374
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,352
...but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

375
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:58,110
I mean, boy, if he had applied that
big brain of his to something good...

376
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,118
...who knows, he could've helped
humanity or something.

377
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,757
I mean, how many actual geniuses
are there in the world, right?

378
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:09,429
lf he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction, who knows?

379
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,312


380
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,794
...not to tell you your business,
but I'm not sure I agree.

381
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:18,557
-What do you mean?
-Well, I mean...

382
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,355
...you showed me that notebook,
and from what I saw--

383
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,595
And this is just my humble opinion.

384
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:27,836
From what I saw on those papers....

385
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,391
Genius?

386
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,232
Not so much.

387
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:37,394
I mean, there was no reasoning,
no deductions in those pages.

388
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,716
So to my eye, all his brilliance...

389
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,479
...looks like nothing more
than just simple rote copying.

390
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,037
Probably of someone else's work.

391
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,953
Believe me, I have been around
enough students to know.

392
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,475
This genius of yours...

393
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:05,988
...maybe he's still out there.

394
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,997
-Hank.
-Hey, babe.

395
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,150
Tim stopped by. He brought over
some file boxes on that case.

396
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:28,395
-Thought I'd take another peek.
-That's great.

397
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,833
Sorry about the mess.

398
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,234
No, no, no. Don't be.

399
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,270
You want me to make some coffee?

400
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:38,958
Yeah.

401
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:40,917
Yeah, that'd be good.

402
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,473
You find something?

403
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,275
Oh, just this guy I'm looking at.

404
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:21,751
You know,
everything he buys and eats...

405
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:26,157
...is organic, fair trade, vegan.

406
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:33,556
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?
