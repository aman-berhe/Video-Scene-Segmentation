1
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,552
In hare.

2
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,678
Hay!

3
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,439
Hey! Hey! What about him?

4
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,319
What about him?

5
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,358
Hay. Someone.

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,708
Halp. Aulltanca.

7
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,673
This man needs help.

8
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,835
This man pays my salary.

9
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,031
Forty point two three pounds.

10
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,392
Are they back yet?

11
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,795
Have you heard from anyone?

12
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,515
If Plnkman I: gene...

13
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,234
...l'm done. Do you understand?
I quit.

14
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,192
| just told you, 40.23 pounds.

15
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,032
Forty point two one.

16
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,918
My brother-in-law, he keeps talking
about driving out to the factory farm.

17
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,396
And I have-- I have stalled him
as long as I possibly can.

18
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,431
It's really at the point now...

19
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,551
...where he's gonna find someone else
to take him there.

20
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,832
So I don't know
if it's been made presentable yet.

21
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,794
But I should be the one
to take him out there, right?

22
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,238
Can you just run it up
the chain of command then?

23
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,713
Anything suspicious?

24
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,754
still no, Walt.

25
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,155
Well, then should we go?

26
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,159
Got some place to be? Because it's,
like, the third time you asked me that.

27
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,193
No, I'm Just curious
what the next move ls.

28
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,437
Our next three movea
la sitting here and waiting.

29
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,436
This here's the job, buddy.

30
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,553
Ain't all supermodels and speedboats,
you know.

31
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,992
Any cartel news these days?

32
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,636
Seems like I'm always reading
something or other in the paper.

33
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,430
Yeah, well,
not a lot happening atatealde.

34
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,631
Hearing rumblings
about some big play down south.

35
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,229
Lots of bodies, apparently.

36
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,954
You know, even by cartel standards.

37
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:13,678
We'll know more
when the buzzards leave the bones.

38
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,029
So when we gonna talk
about your face?

39
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,552
-I don't wanna get Into It, okay?
-No, It's not okay.

40
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,637
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like Macho Camacho...

41
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,070
...and he think:
we're not gonna dlacuaa It?

42
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,475
If you're In over your head
on something...

43
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,558
...don't you think I might be the guy
to come to?

44
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,717
You know, one of my old buddies
from Glynco had a gambling problem...

45
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,357
...except his thing was scratch cards
instead of blackjack.

46
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,875
Dumb Okie bastard had his car repo'd
playing scratch-and-wins.

47
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,153
He'a fine now, you know.
He got help and all.

48
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,789
But I know he got on a ride
that was rough to get off of.

49
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,794
I'm just saying I'm here, you know.

50
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,116
If you want to talk about it.

51
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,396
I don't want to talk about It,
to you or to anyone else.

52
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,148
I'm done explaining myself.

53
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,039
Hey, you think he needs more blood?

54
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,112
It's in the refrigerator.

55
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,752
What, you-- You want me to...?

56
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,795
A-negatlve, yea?

57
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,348
Your blood type?

58
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,195
I don't know, maybe.

59
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,239
A-negative, 25 years old...

60
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,910
...seventy kilo, 180 centimetres.

61
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,240
You amoke, you drink,
you puff, puff, puff.

62
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,154
But no disease, no condition.

63
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,117
No compllcatlon
other than an allergy to....

64
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,513
Oh, wait, don't say.

65
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,993
Erythromycln.

66
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,078
But I have cefazolln here,
so no problem.

67
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,153
How do you know all that?

68
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,711
Jeaua.

69
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,114
He thought of everything.

70
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,710
O-negatlve.

71
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,399
That's what he needs.

72
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,197
It's time to go.

73
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,909
What about Mike?

74
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,029
With this Injury? No travel.
At least a week.

75
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,038
I'll send for him.

76
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,197
You need protection, Gustavo?

77
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,036
I wouldn't have guessed.

78
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,429
Water and rest.

79
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,278
What happened to the plane?

80
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,671
There are many good ways south.

81
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,757
But, unfortunately, only one way north.

82
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,434
Slx mile: to Texas.

83
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,912
I've got a man there
who'll drive us the rest of the way.

84
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,389
I kind of liked the plane.

85
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,471
So you gonna make It?
Slx mllea Ia pretty far.

86
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,432
I'll make It.

87
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,878
You did well down here.

88
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,275
And you also proved a point.

89
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,516
lthlnk you can run the lab
by yourself now.

90
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,278
Don't you?

91
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,910
Let Mr. White go.

92
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,471
Pay him off or fire him.

93
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,358
Don't kill him.

94
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,955
-You know that won't work.
-Then you got a problem.

95
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,313
HI. We're home.

96
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,755
Are you doing your homework?

97
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,551
Yeah.

98
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,989
Well, dinner is in about 30.

99
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,191
Hey, sorry to call you at home...

100
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,357
...but I thInk maybe
you're not gettlng my messages.

101
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,791
That or you just
don't feel IIke taIkIng to me.

102
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,476
Anyway, why I've been calling
is because that thing we discussed?

103
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,557
Well, I've been thinking...

104
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,515
...and I decided I can't do it. That's
probably not what you wanted to hear.

105
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,789
But hopefully you'll understand...

106
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,957
...and If you want to taIk more about It,
that's ﬁne.

107
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,275
So call me. I'm around.

108
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,274
-Hey. Come on In.
-Hl.

109
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,079
First, I wanna tell you that I get it.

110
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,512
From what you've told me, this situation
with Walt's gambling sounds...

111
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,836
...Intense.

112
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,636
Yeah, it definitely was.

113
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,749
And continues to be.

114
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:23,990
So I would greatly appreciate it
if you would just help me out here.

115
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,237
Well, I've thought long and hard
about this...

116
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,671
...and here's what I want to do.

117
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,993
So is Walt gonna be okay?

118
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,792
Are you in contact with him?

119
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,798
He's flne.

120
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,355
Good. That's good.

121
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,591
-He doesn't know about you offering--
-No. Absolutely not.

122
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,394
And I mean to keep it that way, so....

123
00:12:54,599 --> 00:13:01,232
Six hundred and seventeen
thousand dollars written out to me.

124
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:07,351
-What Is this?
-I can't take your money.

125
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,878
-And why Is that?
-Because, at the end of the day...

126
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,790
...paying my debt
with illicit gambling winnings....

127
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,711
I don't know, it feels wrong.

128
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,634
'It feels wrong'?

129
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,511
To me It does.

130
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,838
I'm not judging you or Wait. I'm
just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.

131
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,634
Well, Ted, the whole reason
we're In this mess...

132
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,637
...ls because you had me
cooklng your books.

133
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,390
So when did wrong
suddenly become a problem for you?

134
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,955
Now, hold on,
that was a one-time measure...

135
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,548
...In an honest attempt
to protect my employees...

136
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,238
...and save my dad's company.

137
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,399
lt might've been a big mistake, but
that's no reason to go out make another.

138
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:53,069
No, Ted, this Is the bIg mistake,
right here.

139
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,797
You owe the federal government
$617,000. If you do not pay them...

140
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,310
...they will come after you
and then they will come after me.

141
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,309
And if they audit my business
find out that Wait and I paid for it...

142
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,273
...with close to a million dollars
in untaxed gambling winnings...

143
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,792
...we will go to prison. Where you will
already be. Do you understand?

144
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:19,912
I understand you're upset, but I think
you're overstating things too.

145
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,394
No one's going to prison.

146
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,954
Oh, my God.
How are you not following me here?

147
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,074
Okay, flne,
let's say I take your advice.

148
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,713
I pay the IRS. Then what?

149
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,114
Then you don't owe them.

150
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,278
Okay, but I still owe the bank, Skyler.

151
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:41,108
I'm still going to go bankrupt
and lose my business and my home.

152
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,880
lstlll have to pull my gIrls
out of school.

153
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,676
Just because I pay some stupid fine
doesn't make my life any less ruined.

154
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:55,309
So If I'm understanding you
correctly...

155
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,876
...you're saying you can't take
the money I gave you...

156
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,507
...but you can take a larger amount.

157
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:05,279
No. I'm just saying...

158
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,471
...as much as I appreciate the gesture...

159
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,558
...the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

160
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,468
-Because it's not enough?
-No, no, don't twist my words.

161
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,071
This isn't about amounts,
this is about me doing the right thing.

162
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,276
-Ted, are you blackmailing me?
-What? No. Blackmailing?

163
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,152


164
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,111
-I feel I'm not explaining things right.
-I think you're explaining it fine.

165
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,516
I notice that this is for less
than what I gave you, by the way.

166
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:49,837
That's the Mercedes. l leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

167
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,269
Now that you know,
you will be returning It.

168
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,552
The leases are ironclad,
so I have to see what's possible...

169
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,115
...but, yeah, I'm gonna do my best.

170
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,754
And I will pay you back
as soon as I can.

171
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,829
I don't want you to pay me, Ted.
I want you to pay them.

172
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,632
Try It agaln.

173
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,274
Write a new cheque.

174
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,512
-Skyler.
-Same amount.

175
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,473
-This time, made payable--
-What happened to us?

176
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,468
Make it payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

177
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,759
-I can't.
-You have to.

178
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,237
-Actually, no I don't.
-Wr|te It.

179
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,950
Saul Goodman, please.

180
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,548
Tell him it's important.

181
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,678
Yeah.

182
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,991
What have I done?

183
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,911
Hello, Hector.

184
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,915
All of them, Hector.

185
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:00,513


186
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,037
Don Paco. Cesar.

187
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,833
Renaldo. Artuno.

188
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,995
Clsco and Luis.

189
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:10,269


190
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,070
All dead.

191
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,959
As is your grandson, Joaquin.

192
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,791
Do you know who killed Joaquin?

193
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,910
Would you like to see?

194
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,428
This young man.

195
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,112
Do you remember him?

196
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,273
That young man
shot Joaquln to death.

197
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,433
While I made my escape.

198
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,789
I believe you have met him before.

199
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,951
It was just you and Joaquin.

200
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,119
He was the only family you had left.

201
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,038
Now the Salamanca name
dIes with you.

202
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,510
Will you look at me now?

203
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,034
Look at me, Hector.

204
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,556
Look at me.

205
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,957
I really appreciate you doing this.

206
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,596
You guys must have your hands filled
with the car wash and all.

207
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,471
No, no. No worries.

208
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,791
Happy to do It.

209
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:49,194
Besides, it gives me a chance
to see how you work a case.

210
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,550
-lt's Interesting.
-Yeah.

211
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,829
Like watching weeds grow.

212
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,394
This job can be boring as hell.

213
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,477
Untll It's not.

214
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,997


215
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:09,552
-Any more news on that thing in Mexico?
-No, same old, same old.

216
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,593
Bunch of animals
clawing each other's eyes out over turf.

217
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,834
So you think all the victims
were cartel members?

218
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,668
Not in the loop enough to know.
Take a right on this street, will you?

219
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:22,914
nght?

220
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,509
But we're going to the chicken farm,
that's straight ahead.

221
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,870
No, we're taking a little detour.

222
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,238
All right.

223
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,036
Yeah, there's this industrial laundry
I wanna check out.

224
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:40,117
It's not far.
Just, yeah, turn right here.

225
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,150
What--?
What laundry? What about It?

226
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,238
It's owned by this company,
this Madrigal Electromotive.

227
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,115
It's this big German conglomerate
right into everything.

228
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,632
It turns out it's the same company
that owns Fring's chicken joints.

229
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,794
Sounds like a real shot
In the dark there.

230
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:09,876
I mean, you said it yourself.

231
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,832
If this Madrigal, is it?

232
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,269
If this is such a big conglomerate...

233
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,519
...then, you know, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

234
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,797
No, It just--
It just sounds kind of thin.

235
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:27,230
Well, look at you. You lose your hair,
go on a couple stakeouts...

236
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,829
...all of a sudden you're, what, Kojak?

237
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,712
I'm just saying.

238
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,392
Now, the chicken farm, however,
boy, that place seems ripe...

239
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,070
...for some kind
of clandestlne actlvltles.

240
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,952
I just don't want us to miss anything,
you know?

241
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,434
You wanna talk
about clandestlne actIvItIes?

242
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:49,153
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary...

243
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,273
...that manufactures this
state-of-the-art air filtration system.

244
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,072
And none other than Gale Boetticher
took delivery of one of these systems.

245
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,077
A chemist who was in possession
of hand-drawn plans...

246
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,989
...for a meth super-lab and was visited
by none other than Gus Fring...

247
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,873
...just days before he was capped
in the face, okay?

248
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,150
This shit is starting to feel like--

249
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,555
lee Three Days Of The Condor,
you know?

250
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,072
Anyway, an industrial laundry would be
one hell of a place to hide a meth lab.

251
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,952
There It Is right up there.
Just turn In there.

252
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,916
Well, slow down.
You gotta turn In there, Walt.

253
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,428
-What are you doIng? You missed It.
-Sorry.

254
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:35,348
It looked like a dirt road.
I thought you meant further up.

255
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,669
Just-- Just bang a U-ie over here.

256
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:55,036
Hits the spot. Thanks, guys.

257
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:58,151
I said to Mom 'Ice cream,'
but she was like:

258
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,909
'It tastes the same and It's healthier.‘
So sorry.

259
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,393
I tried.

260
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,195
Frozen yogurt does taste the same.
Tastes exactly the same.

261
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:09,549
I feel, like, sorry for your taste buds.

262
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,079
-We|gh In here, Uncle Hank.
-Hey, It's free food.

263
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,351
Free food always tastes good.
Free drinks even better.

264
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,913
Hey, hon.

265
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,479
Can you handle another visitor?

266
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,910
Mr. Magoo. Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.

267
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,917
-Don't run Into any walls or anything.
-0kay.

268
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,188
Hey, Dad.

269
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,038
Hey, son.

270
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,116
So how you feeling, Hank?

271
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,993
It feels like one of those cones
they put on dogs...

272
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:41,715
-...so they don't lick their own balls.
-Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.

273
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,391
Anyway, hanging in there.
Glad you stopped by.

274
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,558
Listen, I'm sorry about all this.

275
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,193
I mean,
that guy just came out of nowhere.

276
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,196
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

277
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:55,117
I saw him coming a mile away.

278
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:58,313
Hey, just mark It down
as a brain fart...

279
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,591
...and be thankful no one got killed.

280
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,314
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.

281
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,794
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

282
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:10,308
It's too dangerous. You hear me?

283
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,238
-l'll do It.
-No, you won't.

284
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:15,636
No, Marie's right.
It was a bit short-sighted of me.

285
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,718
-That's why I caved.
-Caved?

286
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,434
Yeah, I broke down.
I ordered me a glmp-moblle.

287
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,313
lwish you would stop calling it that.

288
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,313
What do you mean?
Like a handi-van with a lift?

289
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,558
No, no, it's a regular Tahoe.
It's got hand controls. I ordered it.

290
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,877
Should be here in about a week.
I don't expect to be in it long...

291
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,073
...but gotta get around on my own. Stop
being such a damn burden to everyone.

292
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,712
Sorry. Car wash business.

293
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,228
Hey, it's me. Can you talk?

294
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:57,316
-I can listen.
-FaIr enough.

295
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,751
He doesn't own a gun,
at least not one that he bought legally.

296
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,351
Nor does his home security system
have any panic button arrangement.

297
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,598
So way I see it, we're good to go.
If this is still how you want to handle it.

298
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,710
Like I said, I don't want anyone hurt.

299
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,911
All I want
Is for him to write a cheque.

300
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,998
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.
I've got my A-team on It.

301
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,238
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, thanks.

302
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,475
What--? You just can't--

303
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,118
-What's this about?
-l'll tell you what this Is about.

304
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,551
This is about you and me
doing our best to keep Huell happy.

305
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,793
-Huell? Who's Huell?
-Thls Is Huell.

306
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:58,196
-Huell, you happy?
-Reasonably.

307
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,037
What would make you unhappy?

308
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,594
Thls motherfucker
not doIng what he's told.

309
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,952
If you were unhappy,
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?

310
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,514
I'm gonna say no.

311
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:12,029
Well, there you have it.
Let's go find your chequebook. Ready?

312
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:15,515
Here we go. All right?
We're walking, we're swinging our feet.

313
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,677
There you go. Very nice.
Beautiful place you have here.

314
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:25,273
This way. So the amount's
gonna be for $617,226"

315
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,199
-I don't have that kind of money.
-Hold that thought.

316
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,359
Forgot to mention we know exactly how
much money is in your account, okay?

317
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,074
Understand? You still want to say
that stuff from before? Maybe not.

318
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,799
So $617,226 and 31 cents...

319
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:46,628
...made payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

320
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,952
What?

321
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,511
Walt, thls ls...?

322
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,433
-Skyler? Skyler White sent you?
-It doesn't matter.

323
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,869
For now, all you have to do
Is worry about that.

324
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,877
My God, this is a misunderstanding.

325
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,548
Skyler Is a dear friend of mine,
all right?

326
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,227
Let me call her. We'll....

327
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,831
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke. Phone call time is over.

328
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,917
-Cheque writing time.
-Skyler would never do this to me.

329
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,518
Sit down and write!

330
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,316
There you go.

331
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,438
Six hundred-seventeen thousand,
two-hundred-twenty-six dollars...

332
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,197
...and thlrty-one....

333
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,277
Yeah, right.

334
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,557
You got It.

335
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,670
Huell, you happy?

336
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,357
Huell's happy.

337
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:47,347
All right. Everything else

338
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,596

00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:55,153
...rlght there.

341
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:01,958
Great.

342
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,513
Hard part Is over.

343
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:07,109
Here's what happens next.
Huell is gonna hang here with you.

344
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,676
I'm gonna make sure I get this down
to UPS before 5:00.

345
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,949
Way back,
I'm gonna grab some sandwlches.

346
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,152
The three of us can hang out
and play cards or watch TV...

347
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,272
...for the next couple
of days until the cheque clears.

348
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,038
Palnless, rlght?

349
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:23,789
Unless you don't have cable...

350
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,794
...in which case it's gonna suck, so....

351
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,237
Does the laundry have to be dirty?

352
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,158


353
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,752
Someone cooked here.

354
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,707
You've been out of commission
four days.

355
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:09,072
You think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation just for you?

356
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,839
Who cooked? Who was here?

357
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,913
I don't know how you're doing the flips.
Tell me.

358
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,268
Keep cool.

359
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:27,957
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

360
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:32,472
Jump.

361
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,519
You're pressing buttons,
and it makes you do magical stuff.

362
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,517
-No.
-Yes. Cheater.

363
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,438
-Hey.
-Who's wlnnlng?

364
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,359
-I am.
-Go on. Got you. Look at you.

365
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,914
-Look at--
-Yeah.

366
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:53,709
-A hundred and one back flips, I did.
-Oh, you. Hey, keep it going.

367
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,637
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Relax.

368
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,397
-You're In trouble.
-Good luck.

369
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,636
Mama is in the house.

370
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:03,277
Jesse.

371
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,919
-What do you want? I'm busy.
-We need to talk.

372
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,068
I got nothing to say to you, man.

373
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,991
Jesse, please. I'm sorry.

374
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,151
Just one minute. That's all I ask.

375
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,237
Get the hell out of my house.

376
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,873
Come on. Come on.

377
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,116
Hey. Just give me one minute.

378
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,880
Let me just explain. Okay. Okay.

379
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,354
Let me--

380
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,553
All right. All right.
Okay, okay. All right, I'm sorry.

381
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:38,549
I know that you have been cooking
without me.

382
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,512
That's right. So what?

383
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,996
So what?

384
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,875
Isn't It obvious to you
what Gus Is plannlng?

385
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,799
He's going to use you to replace me.

386
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,593
He doesn't think
you need me anymore.

387
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,114
Jesse. Jesse, if you agree...

388
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,276
...to replace me...

389
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,148


390
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,469
You brought your brother-in-law to our
lab. What the hell is wrong with you?

391
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,638
-That's not my fault, Jesse.
-Get off.

392
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,999
You've got to help me. Please.

393
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:19,671
The last time I asked for your help,
you said:

394
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:24,828
"I hope you end up buried in a barrel
in the Mexican desert."

395
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,839
You are done.

396
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,591
FIred.

397
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,874
Do not show your face
at the laundry agaln.

398
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,915
Stay away from Pinkman.

399
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:15,078
Do not go near him.

400
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,111
Even

401
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,990
Are you listening to me?

402
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,755
Or else you'll do what?

403
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,592
What did you say?

404
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,314
Stay away from Pinkman...

405
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:36,989
...or else you'll do...

406
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,752
...what?

407
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,998
Kill me?

408
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:46,907
If you could kill me...

409
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,754
...l'd already be dead.

410
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,669
But you can't.

411
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,678
You can't kill me...

412
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,271
...because Jesse wouldn't cook for you
If you did.

413
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,995
That's It, Isn't It?

414
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,553
No matter how hard you try...

415
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,795
...to turn him against me...

416
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,195
...to screw with his head...

417
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,233
...so that he would hate my guts...

418
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,950
...and he still won't let you do it.

419
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,478
For now.

420
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,513
But he'll come around.

421
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,317
In the meantime, there's the matter
of your brother-in-law.

422
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,352
He Is a problem you promised
to resolve.

423
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,277
You have failed.

424
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:53,631
Now it's left to me to deal with him.

425
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,397
You can't--

426
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,194
If you try to interfere...

427
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,667
...thls becomes
a much simpler matter.

428
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:06,154
lwIll kill your wife.

429
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,476
lwIll kill your son.

430
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,916
I will kill your infant daughter.

431
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,229
Great. Perfect. You know, this is just....

432
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,519
I told her you were my A-team.

433
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,516
It was an act of God.

434
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,950
Ain't no accounting
for no act of God.

435
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,957
Cheque is in the mail, at least.

436
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:17,718
"Hello, Mrs. White.

437
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,549
The good news is the IRS
has been paid off. The bad news is...."

438
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,638
Jesusl

439
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,758
Well, here goes nothing.

440
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:28,234
-HeyI HeyI
-Slow down.

441
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,758
-What the--?
-Saul.

442
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,031
-How dId you hear?
-What? Hear what?

443
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,753
Guys, go, go, go. Scram.

444
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:39,348
-What the hell happened to you?
-Saul. Saul.

445
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,277
This man that we spoke of before.

446
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:44,232
This person that you saId
could disappear me.

447
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,792
-lee me a new life.
-Yeah.

448
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,877
-Make sure I'm never found.
-Yeah.

449
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,957
Yeah, I need him, Saul.

450
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,151
Gus Is gonna murder
my whole family.

451
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,028
Christ.

452
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,753
I need this man now.

453
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,155
-Saul. Now, Saull
-Yeah, yeah.

454
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,989
There's no coming back. You're gonna
get new Socials, new identities.

455
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:07,032
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

456
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,151
-All right. I understand.
-How are you gonna sell this...

457
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,750
-...to that wife of yours and your son?
-I have got no choice.

458
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,872
You're wanted by scary individuals,
not to mention the law.

459
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,435
You're high-risk. You'll need
the deluxe service. It'll cost you.

460
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,789
How much?

461
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,752
Last quote I got on the deluxe
was 125 grand.

462
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:27,996
But you got four people.
It'll be at least half a million.

463
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,474
-He accepts cash only.
-l've got the money.

464
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,907
-Pleasel
-Here.

465
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,438
Okay.

466
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,834
This Is a vacuum cleaner
repair company.

467
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,350
Did you expect Haji's Quick-Vanish?
I don't even know his name.

468
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,391
You just call and leave a message.

469
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,592
You tell them
that you need a new dust fllter...

470
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:48,632
...for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure Pro, Model 60.

471
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,229
I wrote It right on there.
He'll call you back.

472
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:54,237
Okay, fine. How long does it take
for him to arrange?

473
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,316
The guy works fast. That's the game.

474
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,115
You gotta have your family packed
and ready before you make the call.

475
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,551
He'll tell you where to meet,
he'll put you up in a safe house.

476
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:07,115
You gotta bring money. He doesn't
lift a finger unless he's paid.

477
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,594
Okay.

478
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,235
-Saul.
-Can't say It's been a pleasure--

479
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:13,634
I need you to do one more thing
for me.

480
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,319
You need you to call the DEA.

481
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,954
You need to tell them Gus
has a hit out on Hank.

482
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,913
-You have to do It for me.
-I gotta go on lIvIng here.

483
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,271
-l'm way too comfortable in my--
-Just call anonymously.

484
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:26,310
-You call anonymously!
-I can't!

485
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,272
I'm practically in the DEA family.

486
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:31,869
I go to their Christmas parties.
They know me. They know my voice.

487
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,514
They'll know me.
Please, you gotta do It for me.

488
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,914
-Please. Please.
-No.

489
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,395
My brother-in-law doesn't deserve
to die because of this.

490
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,829
There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.

491
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,156
-Okay.
-The most I'll go--

492
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,271
I'll say It's the cartel.
They're back to finish the job.

493
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:52,472
You say whatever you have to say.
You just give me an hour to....

494
00:40:53,279 --> 00:40:55,793
I need to collect my wife and kids.
Okay?

495
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,391
Give me an hour and then you make
the phone call. Don't forget. Please.

496
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,191
Yeah.

497
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:05,157
Thank you, Saul.

498
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,672


499
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,552
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

500
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,354
-Walt?
-Down here!

501
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,755
Wait, what did that phone call mean?

502
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,037
Where Is It?

503
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,791
Where's the rest?

504
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,029
The money, Skyler.
Where Is the rest?

505
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,750
Skyler, where is the money?!

506
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:18,634
I gave It to Ted.

507
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,193
What?

508
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,599
-You dId what?
-Walt, I had to.

509
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:26,312
For us, for the family.

510
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,078
I swear, Walt--

511
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,509
You gave our money to Beneke?

512
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,747
Walt, please.
Please just hear me out. Please.

513
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:45,472
Walt.

514
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,958
Walt.

515
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,348
Walt.

516
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,674
Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.

517
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,711
Skerr.

518
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,273
It's happening again.

519
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:20,757
The DEA called, they got some tip
from an informant.

520
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,310
The cartel, they want to kill Hank.

521
00:43:24,399 --> 00:43:26,230
Oh, God.

522
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:32,717
They're sending agents
to our house right now to guard us.

523
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,717
Oh, God.

524
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,718
When is this going to end?

525
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,316
Marle, I'm here.

526
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,032
I'm here.

527
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:46,878
Tell me exactly what happened.
