1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,391
The city's called Duke
The state's called New Mexico

2
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,353
Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated

3
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,431
'Cause of the new drug they created

4
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,997
They say the colour ls blue
And the quallty pure

5
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:57,753
Thls potent drug's runnln'
Through the clty

6
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,871
And no one could stop It
If they wanted to

7
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,189
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,916
Talkin' 'bout some ”Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

9
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,398
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

10
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,469
The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving

11
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:35,913
But that homey's dead
He just doesn't know it yet

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,234
Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan

13
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,673
From way far away
They want to taste that meth

14
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,274
That blue stuff has crossed the border

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,511
Now New Mexico's Iivin' up to its name

16
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:31,511
Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs lt's hldlng

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,637
Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as ”Heisenberg"

18
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,438
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

19
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,075
Talkin' 'bout some ”Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

20
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,398
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,589
The fury of the cartel
Ain't no one escaped it yet

22
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,833
But that homey's dead

23
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,191
He just doesn't know it yet

24
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,507
Nltrogen bonds to oxygen,
whlch In turn....

25
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,315
You do know what a bond is?

26
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:50,476
A strong force of attraction.

27
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,717
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

28
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,117
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

29
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,719
No?

30
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:05,679
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

31
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,793
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

32
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,072
-What hold us together.
-Yeah. Yeah. No, I got It.

33
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,234


34
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,874
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

35
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,112
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

36
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,395
What Is 'close'?

37
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,476
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

38
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:36,477
There are rlght answers
and wrong answers.

39
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,830
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

40
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,909
Yeah, but I'm Just saylng, Mr. Whlte,
two polnts?

41
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,913
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

42
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,513
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

43
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,393
lee, all nlght, hard.

44
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,717
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

45
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,516
Ijust think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit....

46
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,995
Couldn't you please
Just let thls sllde?

47
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,709
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

48
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,072
The answer Is no.
Next tlme, apply yourself.

49
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,759

When I said, "Handle it."

54
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,519
Well, don't. Just let it go.

55
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,153

Spend it in good health,

Tell me what happened.

116
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:04,193

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,307
...you did not kill anyone?

128
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:44,992
Does anybody think

129
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,952
I called the cops.

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,313
Word.

00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,553
Who's saying that?

205
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,638
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

206
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,400
Usually I gotta chase dudes down

224
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,432
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,

225
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:23,834

00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:27,358

Oh, 10th grade,

239
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,159
He's-- He's taller than I am now.

00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:21,948

241
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,593
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

242
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,315


243
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,872
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

244
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,150
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

245
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,396
-They're gorgeous.
-Yes, they are.

246
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:41,114
And they know It.

247
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,037
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

248
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,831
Yeah.

249
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,997
So the big office, huh?

250
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,837
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,916
Welrd, Isn't It?

252
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,349

253
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,834


254
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,518
Me too.

255
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,309
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

256
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,556
Yeah, he'd be proud.

257
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,118
Walt? How's he doing?

258
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,075
Oh, he's-- He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

259
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,556
-Great. He's stlll teachlng?
-Yeah.

260
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,355
-You tell hlm l sald hello.
-I wlll deflnltely do that.

261
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,114
To be honest, Ted,
l dldn't just stop by to say hello. I....

262
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,438
l was applying for the data-entry job.

263
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,754
Skyler, you were, Ilke,
our go-to bookkeeper.

264
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,314
Yeah. Well...

265
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,874
...the economy, you know, so....

266
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,469
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mlstake.

267
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,957
How about...

268
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,833
...get your old job back?

269
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:04,628
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me...

270
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,035
...the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

271
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,829
Your work would be cut out for you...

272
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,636
...but we could use your help.

273
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,832
Okay.

274
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:25,594
All rlght. Now, thls Is our terrltory,
rlght? Currently.

275
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,028
Hey. Hello.

276
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,469
-Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
-Now, look at thls.

277
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,510
Here, here, here and here.

278
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,676
What does that look like to you?

279
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:39,116
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

280
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,758
No, look.
Look, It's an entlre clty full of buyers.

281
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,631
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

282
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,150
-Because it's not our territory?
-Because we lack initiative.

283
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,588
-Inlt|atlve.
-Yes.

284
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,676
You need to employ more dealers.

285
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:54,109
Double, trlple your crew.
Those three I met?

286
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,392
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

287
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,556
Exponentlal growth,
that's the key here.

288
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,277
It's not our terrltory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

289
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,040
We go rolllng Into
these nelghbourhoods...

290
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,958
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

291
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,715
Sure, they won't like it...

292
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:17,672
...but I say they're not gonna
do a thlng about It.

293
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,756
-No. LIsten, Jesse--
-No.

294
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,518
Jesse.

295
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,437
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

296
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,276
-What are you talking about?
-Apparently, it's all over town.

297
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,869
Somebody crossed you,
you got angry...

298
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,038
...you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

299
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,150
-That's not how It happened.
-Who cares...

300
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,511
...as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

301
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,871
-Oh, my--
-No, don't you see how great thls Is?

302
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,987
Look, you-- You are a....

303
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,791
Jesse, look at me.

304
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,432
You are a blowfish.

305
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,756
-What?
-A blowflsh. Thlnk about It.

306
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:05,918
Small In stature,
not swlft, not cunnlng.

307
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,347
Easy prey for predators...

308
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,755
...but the blowflsh
has a secret weapon...

309
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,190
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?

310
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,153
What does the blowflsh do, Jesse?
What does the blowflsh do?

311
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,796
-I don't even know--
-The blowflsh puffs up.

312
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:24,674
The blowflsh puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

313
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,347
And why? Why does he do that?

314
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,120
So that It makes hlm IntImldatIng,
that's why.

315
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,275
IntImldatIng.

316
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,552
So that the other scarler flsh
are scared off.

317
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,398
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

318
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,433
You see, it's just all an illusion.

319
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,518
You see, it's nothing but air.

320
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,398


321
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,597

-Yeahl

327
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,712

...new guy don't speak Spanlsh.

332
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,308
Hey, whlte boy,

00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,237
You know what? I'll teach you.

335
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,996
It means, "Let's make a deal."

336
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,394

Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

356
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,358
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

357
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,951
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

358
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:40,792
I take my time, but I always win.

359

365
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,668
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

366
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:07,313
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

367
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,478
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

368
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:13,034
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

369
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,752
They keep him busy every second.

370
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,871
He's already got some
bIg operatlon golng.

371
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,355
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about...

372
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,789
...except It's on the other slde
of the border.

373
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:23,512
Wow, that sounds exciting.

374
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,150
He's being safe, right?

375
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,351
Yeah.
He says he's mostly rldlng a desk.

376
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,437
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

377
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,878

Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

384
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,914


385
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,634
You dId not.

he was practically slurring his words.

388
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,236
-Just what you want in an executive.
-And he apologised profusely.

389
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,876
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

390
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,673
It will not happen again.

391
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,034
