1
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,356
Thou paopla.

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,875
Pathatlc.

3
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:33,875
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,956
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,232
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,748
We won't even get the result:
tlll next weak.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,428
Buddy, wo'ro gonna be here.
You klddlng me?

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,234
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

9
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,352
You definitely want the PETICT
and not just the PET.

10
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:54,869
Yeah, It's a PETICT.

11
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,434
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:00,836
Some places Iklmp
and they only do the PET.

13
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,754
I'm not naming any names.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,838
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

15
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,631
This is where Walt's doctor is.

16
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:12,399
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,272
...to get the results.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,313
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,033
I could take one look at Walt's...

20
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,475
...and tell you Immediately
how he's doing.

21
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,352
-Really.
-Doctore like people to think...

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,870
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

23
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,038
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,238
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,398


26
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,997
You all right in there?

27
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,912
Yeah.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,078
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,713
Yea.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,956
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,198
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,235
-So how'd we do?
-You did flne.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,358
-See anything?
-l'm Just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:47,278
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,832
Sorry.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,956
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

37
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,596
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,359
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:39,347
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,470
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,913
Weeks.

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,633
Maybe.

43
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,238
Sorry to hear It.

44
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,910
l was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,795
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,593
How much money
are we laundering?

47
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,757
At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,032
How long you been doing this?

49
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,388
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,999
Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,319
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

52
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,909
...mlnus my fee,
which Is 17 percent...

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,157
...comes to $9960.

54
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,830
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,430
Well, we'll Just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,914
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,237
Make hay
while the sun |s stlll shlnlng.

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,157
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,510
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,031
Actually, I....

61
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,473
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,351
-Really?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,838
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,716
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,198
God, Walt.

66
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,117
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

67
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,550
lam. Positive is good.

68
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,909
I'm all for positive...

69
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:33,397
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

70
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,918
lt....

71
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,867
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,399


73
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,830
Walt, I'm Just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,030
You know, forgive me.

75
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,192
Look...

76
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,197
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if--

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,913
If...

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,028
...l'm no longer around.

79
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,311
IJust need to get that straight,
that's all.

80
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,588
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

81
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,509
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

82
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:16,278
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

83
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,836
A 30-minute discourse...

84
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,350
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,711
And, oh, she's countlng
every one of them, you know.

86
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,951
I'll be lucky
If I get a word In edgewlse.

87
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,994
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

88
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,358
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

89
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,519
Yeah.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,039
-We should do something.
-Yeah, we should.

91
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,595
No, something else.

92
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,470
We should go somewhere.

93
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,351
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

94
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,596
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

95
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,155
Georgia O'Keeffe.

96
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,190
She's a painter.

97
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,671
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

98
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,676
No, Is that bad?

99
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,430
-Boy, you need some educating.
-Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

100
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,632
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

101
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,276
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

102
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,947
So romantlc.

103
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,719
Yup, we're going. Get up.

104
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,552
Why can't we Just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

105
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,954
It's the shit.

106
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,157
A little culture won't kill you.

107
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,795
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.

108
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,194
Really?

109
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,268
-Is there still cereal?
-Yeah.

110
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,992
Yo, ifl know you, leave a message.

111
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,839

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,111
-HeIIo? Jesse, plck up--
-Hold on, hold on.

113
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,275

115
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,034

116
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,634
-l've been busy.
-WeII, clear your socIaI calendar.

117
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,230
-We have to cook.
-What? Today?

118
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,748
No, you'll need today at least
to gather suppIIes.

119
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,109
Now, we're golng to need
a" new glassware...

120
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,709
...heatlng mantles,
about a hundred pounds of Ice.

121
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,672
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

122
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,712
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

123
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,559
Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating...

124
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,149
...do not constitute plans
In my book.

125
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,351
WeII, screw you and your book, man,
a" rIght?

126
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,393
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

127
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:15,638
-You're going to a museum, huh?
-Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

128
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,751
-Georgla O'Keeffe?
-She's a paInter, duh.

129
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,358
She does these vagina pictures.

130
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,552
Or paintings, or Just palnted.
I don't know.

131
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,113
What are you even talking about?

132
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,356
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

133
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,550
It's none of your damn buslness
what I'm doing.

134
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,957
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

135
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,559
Let me explain something to you.

136
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,672
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

137
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,919
-Tuesday? Four days straight?
-Like it or not, we have no choice.

138
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,271
Yeah? And why exactly is that?

139
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,275
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

140
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,630
-What?
-lt's Ioslng Its chemlcal potency.

141
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,831
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you....

142
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,267
Hell, no.

143
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,993
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

144
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,316
You have a paper and pencil?

145
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,388
-Come on.
-All right, all right. Go.

146
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,354
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

147
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,676
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

148
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,836
I really wish
you dIdn't have to do this.

149
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,352
Me too.

150
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,231
But I'll be back before you know it...

151
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:22,033
...and you can always call
If you need me.

152
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:26,630
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

153
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,072

154
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,719
-Fly safe, okay?

00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,672
How about something
with some protein maybe?

173
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,075
Something green, huh?

174
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,511
Man, I'm getting no service.

175
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,995
How are you even alive?

176
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,435
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

177
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,278
Yeah, I've got a signal.

178
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,749
-Hey, let me use yours, would you?
-Absolutely not.

179
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,029
l have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

180
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,195
-You know that.
-lt's not business, all right?

181
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,627
-lt's personal.
-Oh, personal.

182
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,512
-What, female?
-Maybe.

183
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,471
Absolutely. That's all I need.

184
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,874
Skyler hlts redIal
and some strlpper answers.

185
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,629
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
chkwad.

186
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,509
Sorry. My wife checks.

187
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,511
-Dr|nk|ng water?
-Yup.

188
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,311
Is that all we've got?

189
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,273
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

190
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,147
Oh, God.

191
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:10,594
No, not there.
That Is our workstation.

192
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,951
-Oh, our 'workstatlon.‘
-That's right.

193
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,195
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

194
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,878
Considering it's our only set...

195
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,913
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

196
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,716
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

197
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,710
Two-point-three-five pounds.

198
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,558
Two-point-three-five.

199
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,352
That's the last of it.

200
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:42,109
-How many total?
-N|neteen.

201
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,200
So dollar-wlse?

202
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,957
How much?

203
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:50,151
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

204
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,911
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at....

205
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:57,394
-What are we selling for these days?
-Forty a pound.

206
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,272
-Forty thousand dollars?
-Hey, you said raise the prices.

207
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,232
All right, that's 40 times 42...

208
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,351
...minus distribution charges....

209
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,634
What?

210
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,428
What?

211
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,389
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

212
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,114
-All In?
-No.

213
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,839


214
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,395
Each?

215
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,114
-Each.
-Slx hundred and--?

216
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,675
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:32,189
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

218
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,916
Hey, come hlgh, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

219
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,797
Yes! Yes!

220
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,398
Well, there goes the generator.

221
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,830
I think that's it for the gas.

222
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,472
Perfect tlmlng, yo.

223
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,433
-How do you figure that?
-What do you mean?

224
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:55,594
We're done cooking.

225
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,597
I am not done
until this barrel Is empty.

226
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,914
Look at this.

227
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:03,236
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

228
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,432
-Come on, where's your ambltlon?
-Jesus. Seriously?

229
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,835
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

230
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,872
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

231
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,878
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

232
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,547
Come on, can we at least
Just take the night off?

233
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,193
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

234
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,833
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the slzzle...

235
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,472
...and glass up the rest.

236
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:25,634
Come on.

237
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,593
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

238
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,392
Grand Slam?

239
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,670
Hot shower?

240
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:33,948
A bed?

241
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,314
-Separate rooms.
-Yeah, that's a given.

242
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,712
What the hell?

243
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,318
What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:56,792
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

245
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,554
...where did you put them?

246
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,310
-I left them right here in the ignition.
-Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,589
Whoa, whoa, no,
this Is not my fault, all right?

248
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,279
-The buzzer dIdn't buzz.
-The what?

249
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,630
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

250
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,398
...to let you know the battery's on.

251
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,192
I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,594
Look, I dIdn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,598
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,835
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,553
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

256
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,273
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,515
The buzzer did not buzz.

258
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,789
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,557
Yes, I see your point.

260
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,273
Your imbecility being what it is,
lshould've known to say:

261
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,552
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,273
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bItch.

263
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,755
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

264
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,791
-Jesus.
-Okay, just....

265
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,599
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

266
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,357
Okay.

267
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,709
How?

268
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,629
You gonna be okay?

269
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,916
Oh, damn It.

270
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,158
What's it taste like?

271
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,749
Bad, huh?

272
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,875
This Is good.
This Is good. Right here.

273
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,991
Okay. There.

274
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,793
Here. Red to red, black to black.

275
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,030
Posltlve, negatlve.
All right. Start It up.

276
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,670
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

277
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:47,677
-You have to really pull.
-I am.

278
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,597
No, really pull, not like a girl.

279
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,359
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulllng.

280
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,878
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

281
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,229
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,431
Oh, jeez.

283
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,274
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just....

284
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,992
Well done.

285
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,998


286
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,956
Come on, you bitches.

287
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,150
Hear me now.

288
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,590
Damn It.

289
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,072
Stupld.

290
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:19,149
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

291
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,396
This Is rulned. Do you understand?
Just rulned.

292
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,517
You hooked It up wrong
and blew It up.

293
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,359
No, no, no.
That Is not what happened.

294
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,629
How do you know?

295
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,071
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

296
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,951
-That's what I know.
-There was a fire.

297
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,912
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

298
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,110
Is that what you were--?
You were thinking?

299
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,072
Now that we have
ldentlfled the problem--

300
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,395
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

301
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,435
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

302
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:48,789
Your wife Is not gonna notlce
one little call.

303
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,516
Mr. White, come on.

304
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,114


305
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,189
All right, look, just make it snappy.

306
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:02,357
-Roam|ng drains the battery.
-All right.

307
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,152
Yo, Skinny, hey.

308
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,397
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

309
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,878
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

310
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,832
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

311
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,394
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,873
All right, so you ready?

313
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,992
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

314
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,637
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

315
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,591
All right--
No, bIg arrows, glant arrows.

316
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,916
They light up and bllnk.
You can't miss them.

317
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,236
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

318
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,193
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on It, okay?

319
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,039
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:47,312
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

321
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,237
About another 15 miles.

322
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,079
-Really? That far?
-Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

323
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,237
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

324
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,989
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

325
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,556
Oh, and, yo, hey, llsten.

Here.

328
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,038


329
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,514
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

330
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,029
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

331
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,799
...and he had to drink urine for....

332
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:24,752
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

333
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,830
He saId It tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

334
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,512
Look, we should just call, you know?

335
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:40,348
I'll be quick, just be like,
'Yo, where are you?‘

336
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:44,038
All right.

337
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,677
Come on.

338
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,675
Yo. Yo, where are you?

339
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,073
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

340
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,713
Yes, he's almost here.

341
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,548
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

342
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,114
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:13,230
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

344
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,397
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

345
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,591
Wait, wait. What river?

346
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,073
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

347
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,714
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

348
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,036
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you--?

349
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,792
Phone's dead.

350
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,072
Now what?

351
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,871
Mr. White, what now?

352
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,511
Oh, come on. Seriously?

353
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:20,351
What's this?

354
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:24,470
I'm trying to...

355
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,308
...trickle-charge the battery.

356
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,996
Seriously?

357
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,356
Just by turning that thing?

358
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,278
The commutator.

359
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,314
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

360
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:42,268
Usually this little piston engine
turns It...

361
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,391
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totalled....

362
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,471
Anyway.

363
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,310
Apply a little elbow grease.

364
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,718
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

365
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,673
...but theoretically...

366
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,670
...It should work.

367
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,030
Theoretically.

368
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,477
It has to work.

369
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,071
You understand?

370
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,998
Can I try?

371
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,431
How much longer?

372
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,111
I don't know.

373
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,512
Now?

374
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,278
Hey.

375
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,798
Mr. White.

376
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,918
Hey.

377
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,679
Yeah?

378
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,069
Yo, man, you hanging in?

379
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:01,676
Yeah, I'm good.

380
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,310
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

381
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,627
No, give it a little longer...

382
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,831
...just to make sure we're--

383
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,280
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

384
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,879
...does It?

385
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,388
No. That's not why we're here.

386
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,399
Yo.

387
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,358
LIe much?

388
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,673
Here, push.

389
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,478
Okay, okay, okay.

390
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:23,232


391
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:26,232


392
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,472
Please, please, please.

393
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,549
Yes. Yes.

394
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,076
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

395
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,669


396
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,591
Please. Please.

397
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,111
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

398
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,153
Why? Why?

399
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:34,550
Mr. White.

400
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,317
Mr. White!

401
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:45,151
What are you doing?

402
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,358
Mr. White?

403
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,431
Oh, God.

404
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:10,235
l have this coming.

405
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,118
What?

406
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,716
l have It comlng.

407
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,671
I deserve this.

408
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:24,996
Hey, snap out of It.

409
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:28,987
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

410
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,633
nght?

411
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,279
All lever managed to do...

412
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:38,676
...was worry and disappoint them...

413
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,112


414
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,788
Oh, God.

415
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:46,795
All the lIes.

416
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,357
I can't even....

417
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,438
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

418
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,160
You know what? Screw this.

419
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,796
I'm walking. You can come or not.

420
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:05,113
Where's my other shoe?

421
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,398
Jesse. Jesse.

422
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,230
Your body...

423
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,115
...ls runnlng dangerously low
on electrolytes.

424
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,189
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

425
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,755
And when they're gone...

426
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,589
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

427
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,637
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

428
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,674
You go marching out there...

429
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:43,588
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

430
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,713
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

431
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,750
...and think of something scientific.

432
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:53,076
Something--
Something sclentlflc, rlght.

433
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,112
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

434
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,879
You made poison out of beans, yo.

435
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:02,188
All right, look. We got--

436
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,314
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

437
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,475
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

438
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,147
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

439
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,158
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

440
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,510
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

441
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,313
...or a homlng devlce...

442
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,271
...or build a new battery or....

443
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,231
Or waIt, no.

444
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:27,589
What If we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

445
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:31,109
...and build it into something
completely different?

446
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,072
You know, like a....
lee a dune buggy.

447
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,590
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or....

448
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:42,557
What? Hey. What is it?

449
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,993
What?

450
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,633
Do you have any money?

451
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:49,908
Change, I mean. Coins.

452
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,793
-Yeah, I got a bunch from the--
-Okay.

453
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,752
-Yes.
-Gather them.

454
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,668
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

455
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,111
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

456
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,756
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

457
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,075
-Sol|d zlnc, okay.
-And-- And bring me--

458
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,555
Bring me brake pads.

459
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:14,195
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

460
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,039
-Okay. Brake pads, okay.
-Brake pads.

461
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,394
What are we building?

462
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,993
-You saId It yourself.
-A robot?

463
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,239
-A battery.
-Yes.

464
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:30,236
Movel

465
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,039
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

466
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,310
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

467
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,111
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

468
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:55,073
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

469
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,872
Remember the electrolytes?

470
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,314
Well, think about it.

471
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,031
A battery is a galvanic cell.

472
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,878
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

473
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,116
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

474
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,797
-nght.
-Yeah, well, anyway.

475
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:14,469
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

476
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:16,795
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

477
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,993
This Is the cathode.
This Is the positive terminal.

478
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,272
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

479
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,995
Then.... Here, I'll show you.

480
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,633
On the opposite side is our anode.

481
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,593
Thls.

482
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,438
It's zlnc.

483
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,509
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

484
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,995
-So the sponge Is the electrolyte?
-Yeah.

485
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:47,908
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

486
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,033
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges In.

487
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:54,398


488
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,950
Good. And now, what shall we use...

489
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,720
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

490
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,034
What one particular element
comes to mind?

491
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,397
ere.

492
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,912
Copper.

493
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,076
-Oh, I mean--
-Copper.

494
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,633
nght.

495
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,511
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

496
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,518
And how many cells will we need?

497
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:33,472
We've only got materlal enough
for six.

498
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,271
Okay.

499
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,071
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

500
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:47,678
All right.

501
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,477
Cathode.

502
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,913
Anode.

503
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,998
Damn. That is good.

504
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,351
That Is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

505
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,475
Come on.

506
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:09,231
Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact...

507
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:11,634
...wlth your personal belonglngs
at all tlmes.

508
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,229
Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated by....

509
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,111
How's the...?

510
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:19,712
It's fine.

511
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:33,431
I know I can trust you to....

512
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,638
Yeah.

513
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,073
Hey, whatever happens...

514
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,829
...your family will get your share.

515
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,073
Thank you.

516
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,237


517
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,955
...l'll be hearing from you, yeah?

518
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,073
Yeah.

519
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,916
How's everyone doing?

520
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,598
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

521
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:40,633
-I know. I know, enough already. It's--
-l'm teaslng.

522
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,717
Everything in its time.

523
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,993
Wait, I have your scan results.

524
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,710
-Yeah.
-You're showing signs of remission.

525
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,667
-Oh, my God.
-I wanna clarify.

526
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,474
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

527
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,954
It does not mean
that the patient Is cured.

528
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:05,117
To classlfy someone
as In remlsslon...

529
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:07,913
...we only need to determine
that the tumour hasn't grown.

530
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:10,394
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

531
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,068
Technically speaking...

532
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:15,191
...a tumour can remain
the exact same size it was before...

533
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,755
...and the patient
could still be In remlsslon.

534
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:21,349
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage III adenocarcinoma...

535
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,471
...l'd like to see, I hope to see...

536
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,149
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumour mass...

537
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,639
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

538
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,557
Everybody still with me?

539
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,510
And how has my cancer responded?

540
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:42,950
Walt, your tumour has shrunk
by 80 percent.

541
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,392
-Oh, my God.
-Wa|t, waIt, waIt. I'm sorry.

542
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,749
Wait, I'm really.... I'm confused.

543
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:55,268
ls--? lsn't 80 percent a lot?

544
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:00,312
-Mom, yeah.
-Yes, 80 percent Is a lot.

545
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,514
-Okay, but, I'm-- Walt--
-Sweetheart, you were right.

546
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,359
-lt's very good news.
-lt's very good news.

547
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,471
-Oh, my God.
-My God, are you kidding me?

548
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,718
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back In.

549
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,712
That's great.

550
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:28,391
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

551
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,309
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

552
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,511
It's okay. This is fairly common.

553
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,998
See that scary-looking thing there?

554
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:41,876
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

555
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:45,192
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

556
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,391
l'll prescribe some prednisone.

557
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,398
Tissue inflammation? l....

558
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:52,476
Are you sure about that? I mean, l--

559
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:58,231
Because the other day,
l was coughing up some blood.

560
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,318
-What?
-You probably have a tear...

561
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,033
...In your oesophagus
from coughlng.

562
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,912
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

563
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,351
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

564
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:12,312
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

565
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:14,953
-l'm sorry, ljust--
-No more secrets, Walt.

566
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,709
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

567
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:22,918
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

568
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,950
But now at least
we have some options...

569
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,912
...the most Important of which
Is tlme.

570
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,269
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

571
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:35,108
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

572
00:43:38,439 --> 00:43:40,236
-Yes.
-Yeah.

573
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:41,554
Oh, my God.
