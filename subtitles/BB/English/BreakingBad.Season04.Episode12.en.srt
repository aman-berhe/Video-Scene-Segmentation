1
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,827
They're here, out front.

2
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,076
-How many?
-Nel:on Bray, thru others.

3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,554
-H|: toothbrush?
-Got It.

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,875
What about your stuff?

5
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,037
Oh, we'll talk to them
about stopping at your place.

6
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,195
Skylar. Skylar.

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,514
-What?
-l'm not golng.

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,075
-What?
-l'm not golng to Hank and Marle'l.

9
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,918
-We're In danger.
-Yes, that's true. Because of me.

10
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,598
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,074
All that matters
Is the rest of you are safe.

12
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:58,952
And that's why
I'm not golng wlth you.

13
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,228
I'm the real target.

14
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,351
-But we'll all be safer at Hank's.
-No, no, no.

15
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,073
No one wlll be safe at Hank's
If I'm there.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,748
Walt, It's the DEA.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,076
Skyler, you don't know these people.

18
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,598
.|..
-No. Skyler, please.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,155
Trust me. This is how it has to be.

20
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,510
Those agents outside.
They're not gonna just leave you here.

21
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,198
lt's protective custody.

22
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:23,994
All they know is that Hank
is the only person that's in danger.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,431
They're including us as a courtesy
to Marie, to keep her happy.

24
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:32,554
How am I supposed to explain that
to Marie or Junior? Or Hank?

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,159
I don't know.

26
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,429
But you'll do it. You'll figure it out.

27
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,429
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreactlng.

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,431
Except she's not.

29
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,354
I'll talk to Hank. You just back me up
with everyone else.

30
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:53,791
You really expect me to say,
"Okay, Walt, sure. Just stay here and"....

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,873


32
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,831
There's gotta be another way.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,029
There Isn't.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,632
There was.

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,077
But now there isn't.

36
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,231
Walt...

37
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,629
...how long till you're safe?

38
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,194
Till you can work this out?

39
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,156
0h, Skyler.

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,875


41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,753
-Skyler.
-No.

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,909
l have lived under the threat of death
for a year now.

43
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:31,438
And because of that,
I've made cholces.

44
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,470
.|..
-Llsten to me.

45
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,910
I alone should suffer the consequences
of those choices, no one else.

46
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,272
And those consequences...

47
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,518
...they're coming.

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,718
No more prolonging the inevitable.

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,670
Feed that belt through
those seatbelt holders.

50
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,915
Hank, I've got a car wash to run.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,352
I mean, you don't honestly believe
that I'm in danger, do you? Me?

52
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:12,950
Oh, Jesus, it's gonna go over like a
lead balloon. It'll be Marie that kills me.

53
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,151
Well, just know that I'll get there
as soon as I can.

54
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,669
And let Steve Gomez know.
I told his guys.

55
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,710
And just stay safe.

56
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,558
Oh, please.
Whole thing's just a giant jerk-off.

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,833
Yeah, yeah. But keep your head down
anyway, all right?

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,519
All right.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,950
All right, buddy. Take care.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,039


61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,753
Okay, sweetle.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,391
Okay, my love. Okay. Okay.

63
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,873
Okay, my darling. It's okay.

64
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,307
All right.

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,317
Okay.

66
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,673
He's gonna rlsk his life
over a stupid car wash?

67
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,473
Does he understand
what's going on with Uncle Hank?

68
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,272
He'll come when he's able.

69
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,515
That's pathetic. l--

70
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,280
How hard did you even try
or did you?

71
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,676
-Hey, hey, hey. Lay off your mom.
-Well, you know, Hank.

72
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,111
We wouldn't be arguing about this if
you and Steve would make him come.

73
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,037
Why didn't you put him
In the car?

74
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,276
-lt's not Nazi Germany, all right?
-Oh, you-- Nazi Germany.

75
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,074
If I had a dollar for every time
I heard that. I'm gonna call him.

76
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,239
He's gonna get his behind here.
Immediately. End of story.

77
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,670
Thank you,
at least somebody |s llstenlng.

78
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,269
-Because we are all in danger here.
-We're not all in danger here.

79
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,233
Will you stop saying that?
That is asking for trouble.

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,353
Come on, Walt.

81
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,832
He's not picking up.

82
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,111
Look, could we just take this down
a notch, okay? Everybody?

83
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,628
You guys can stay here
as long as you like.

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,989
We got plenty of room.

85
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,590
I wouldn't worry about any danger
to Walt or any of us, okay?

86
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,148
This whole thing
|s just a damn smoke screen.

87
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:48,193
-How do you mean "a smoke screen"?
-An anonymous threat against me?

88
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,868
I'm stuck In a wheelchair,
I'm not even on the job.

89
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,789
No, someone didn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

90
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,509
Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh?

91
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,278
I start looking...

92
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,232
...Into Frlng,
I'm under lockdown for my protection.

93
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,112
-Dld you say--?
-Gus Frlng?

94
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,230
-What--?
-From the chicken restaurant?

95
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,556
Hank, what are you talking about?

96
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,278
Just one man's humble opinion,
that's all.

97
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,550
I think Los Pollos Hermanos
Is a front...

98
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,671
...for the biggest meth distributor
in the Southwest.

99
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,236
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Steve, are you even looking into this?

100
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,910
We're looking into everything.
But we work on fact, not conjecture.

101
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,557
And the fact is that the scumbags
that hit you first were Mexican cartel...

102
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,228
...not some German multlnatlonal
whatever.

103
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,032
Definitely not Colonel Sanders.

104
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,276
Now, if we even had a shred of proof--

105
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,595
Isn't that what you get paId
to go get?

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,470
From that laundry I told you about.
I'd start there.

107
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,748
-Come on, man.
-Jesus.

108
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,837
It's the perfect spot
for a meth superlab.

109
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,359
Oh, my God.

110
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,753
Hey...

111
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,549
...what If I'm right?

112
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,399
Even if you were right-- And you ain't.

113
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,591
--there's no way a judge
is gonna give me a warrant.

114
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,110
Warrant? What happened
to good old-fashioned knock and talk?

115
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:10,752
Oh, that's right.

116
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,948
I forgot.

117
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,878
You were never very good at those,
were you?

118
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,472
-Can I help you?
-Yes, sir.

119
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,114
We wondered
if we could take a look around.

120
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,309
Why?

121
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,350
-Sorry, what's your name?
-Denn|s.

122
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,394
Dennis. Hey. I'm Steve Gomez.
I'm with the DEA. Drug Enforcement.

123
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,715
Is there a problem?

124
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,148
For you? No. No problem.

125
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,158
We were just wondering
if we could take a look around.

126
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,117
Can I tell you a story?

127
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,912
-Yeah.
-I bust thls chef.

128
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,439
Well, he says he's a chef.

129
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,996
Because you work at a restaurant
that charges $14 for a burger...

130
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,272
...that don't make you a chef.
Makes you a burger-flipper.

131
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:16,878
-Least In my book.
-Yeah.

132
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,753
Anyway, so we bust thls chef,
heroln possesslon.

133
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,556
He says, "Just because you found heroin
in my chef whites doesn't make it mine.

134
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,435
Maybe it came from the place that
launders my chef whites." This place.

135
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,677
-We don't do that stuff over here.
-I know, I know.

136
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,393
I'll say It for you.

137
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,272
HIs story Is a bIg load
of steaming horse shlt.

138
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,710
We're gonna find heroin here
like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa.

139
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,068
nght?

140
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,831
The thing is that this chef's daddy
is a United States senator.

141
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,792
I'm not gonna tell which one,
but you know who he is.

142
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:53,311
So now I gotta waste my time
checking out this burger-flipper's story.

143
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,749
If I don't,
his old man's gonna jam me up...

144
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,189
...my ASAC, my whole entire office.

145
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,991
Polltlcs, huh?

146
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,315
So, what do you think?

147
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,635
Listen, I have to check
on my boss.

148
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,037
He's out of town. I can't promise
I'll reach him anytime soon.

149
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,355
Well, yeah.
That's probably the way to go.

150
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,393
I'll have to go get a warrant
and we'll do it official.

151
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,430
You have to close down for the day.

152
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,598
-What--? Why?
-Twenty agents poking around?

153
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,835
It'd be less trouble if it was just us.

154
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,838
But your call.

155
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,755
Just the two of you?
You make It qulck, rlght?

156
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,474
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.

157
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,835
-0kay.
-Could you tell him?

158
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,713
-0kay.
-0kay.

159
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,029
Can you clear out
some of your people for us?

160
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,515
Confuses the dog's nose.

161
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,873


162
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,868
...how long we gotta be quiet
down here?

163
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,352
And what happens after this?

164
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,790
Provided they don't find their way
in here and bust our asses?

165
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,390
I gotta be, like, snuck down here in a
laundry hamper for the rest of eternity?

166
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,034
Now, I'm going on record.

167
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,707
Thls blows.

168
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,193


169
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,998

00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,030
l have a pretty good idea.

173
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,073
This Is all the result
of your former partner.

174
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,915
Do you understand now?

175
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,232
Do you see why this can't continue?

176
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,749
I get It.
The guy Is a complete and total dlck.

177
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,029
But I can't.

178
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,230
I'm not signing off.

179
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,318
Okay?

180
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,276
Like I said...

181
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,033
...If something flnal happens
to Mr. White...

182
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,394
...we're going to have a problem.

183
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,955
So, what are you gonna do?

184
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,669
There will be
an appropriate response.

185
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,598
Appropriate? What does that mean?

186
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,233
Hello?

187
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,473
They're gone.

188
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,157

-Hey. Yo, get your goon off me.
-Not him, moron. Drop.

203
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,389
Leave it. Go lie down. Sorry.
You can't be too careful these days.

204
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,827
Come on, come on.

205
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,758
Lock the door, Frisky. Jesus.

206
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,478
Take a break, H.T. Let's go.

207
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:51,273
Stop calling me that
or I'll hang you by your tle.

208
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,710
Yeah, yeah.
Stop showing off for the client.

209
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,037
Honey Tits. I say it's endearing.

210
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:00,437
So, what's so important?

211
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,914
Well, they're here.
The end times, kld.

212
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,349
-End times.
-What does that mean?

213
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,993
Why'd you drag me here for?

214
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:10,555
You want your money, don't you?
I assume that you do.

215
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,874
That couldn't wait?

216
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,674
Ever hear of the expression,
'A fart In the wlnd'?

217
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:18,918
Inside of an hour, that will be me,
I'm hitting the road. I'm out of here.

218
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,079
-What, for, like, good?
-For as long as It takes.

219
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,874
I don't like my heat so hot
If you catch my drift.

220
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,116
I'm not catchlng anything
you're saying.

221
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,469
What is your problem?

222
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,831
-You haven't talked to your partner?
-Not since last night.

223
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,158
Today, he didn't show up to work
and the DEA just happened to raid us.

224
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,558
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?

225
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:41,831
Yeah, I don't know about that.

226
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,554
All I know is when he tells me
that your employer took him out...

227
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,432
...threatenlng to murder his family,
I take notice.

228
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:50,869
Because after all,
what am I, If not famlly?

229
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,798
What are you talking about?
When did that happen?

230
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:56,878
I don't know. Forget it.

231
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,309
I mean, he exaggerates, right?
He does that.

232
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,397
Hey, listen. Do me a favour.

233
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,549
Put in a good word for me with Fring.
I mean, just for old time's sake.

234
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,796
I can't afford
to butter the wrong bread here.

235
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,073
Yeah?

236
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,555
Hey.

237
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,112
Hey.

238
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:46,788
Nothing, huh?

239
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,398
Clean as a whistle...

240
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,036
...so he says.

241
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,152
You've reached Walter White.

242
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,272
State your name, number
and the reason for your call.

243
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,913
Thank you.

244
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,757
It's me again.

245
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,590
I really wish you'd pick up.

246
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,352
God, ljust....

247
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,318
Call me back, okay?

248
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,747
Just....

249
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,755
Just call me back, please.

250
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,476
Hi. I'm sorry. Is it okay
if I come out here for a few minutes?

251
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,156
Sure.
Just stay up here, If you would.

252
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,713
Okay.

253
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,596


254
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,594
I wonder If you have a--
An extra charette.

255
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:14,313
I sure could use a smoke
right about now.

256
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,998
Sure.

257
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,793
Thank you.

258
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,998
Thanks.

259
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,354
Hey, what's up?

260
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,354

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,153
Hey. Hey.

00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,278

-They got me filling all this paperwork.
-How is he doing? Tell me.

268
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:35,358
The doctors,
they don't know what It Is exactly.

269
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,471
It's like he's got the flu.

270
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:42,149
But he just keeps getting worse.

271
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,669
Jesse, I don't understand.

272
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,756
He was fine this morning.

273
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:53,752

00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:05,035
-You can bring that with you.
-Okay.

277
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,628
-Slr, you're the boy's father?
-No.

278
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,196
Okay. Sorry. It's just we try to keep it

-Hey. No yelllng.

289
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,994

-I need to talk to her.

290
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,508

What Is It?

294
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,908
Jesse, I can't go out.
My son's In here.

295
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:32,670
Okay. I'm thinking Brock
may have been poisoned, okay?

296
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:33,948
What?

297
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,435
There's this stuff,
this stuff called rIcln.

298
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,551
Sounds like rice. You need
to tell the doctors about it.

299
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,192
What? How do you know?

300
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,357
Doesn't matter.
Just tell them It's a guess. Okay?

301
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,993
Rlcln.
They'll know what you're talking about.

302
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:51,714
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying, you have to tell me.

303
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,750
I gotta go. I gotta go see someone.

304
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,677
-Jesse.
-l'm sorry, I gotta go.

305
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:57,358
Just tell them, okay?

306
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,436
Now. Just do It.

307
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,227
Hello. Could you buzz me in, please?

308
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,396


309
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,557
What do you want?

310
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,511
We need to talk.

311
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,229
-Who's with you?
-No one. Just me.

312
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,475
Let me In.

313
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,308
I don't know what you're thinking
coming here.

314
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,870
Oh, Christ.

315
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,910
What does it matter?

316
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,589
Everything, it's all coming to an end.

317
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,108
Do you even know
what's happening?

318
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,515
The full scope of what's happening?

319
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,590
They took me out into the desert.

320
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,471
They put a hood over my head...

321
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,113
...and drove me out Into the desert
on my knees.

322
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,869
They threatened my family
and not just Hank.

323
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,234
My wife, my children.

324
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,194
It's just a matter of time now.

325
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,071
l was able to protect them for now,
but....

326
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,388
Gus is gonna make his move.

327
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,678
And I don't-- I don't know when.

328
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:11,474
I don't know where or how.

329
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,959
All I know is it's gonna happen.

330
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,434
And I'm powerless to stop him.

331
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,719
What are you doing?

332
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,950
Why did you do it?

333
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,911
-Why?
-Jesse.

334
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,357
Gus gave me no choice.

335
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,030
I had to call the DEA to protect
my family. What else could I do--?

336
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,312
Okay, look, just--

337
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:50,351
Just put the gun down, okay?

338
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,074
Just put It down and we'll talk,
all right?

339
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,113
You tell me
what It Is you think I did.

340
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,434
Brock.

341
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,788
Why did you poison him?

342
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:01,877
-Who's Brock?
-You saw him In my lIvIng room.

343
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,038
You came and you looked right at him,
so don't tell me you don't know him.

344
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:07,877
The boy?

345
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,231
Jesse, l have no Idea
who these people are.

346
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,429


347
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,189
Okay,
that's Brock and he was poisoned?

348
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,832
The rIcln.

349
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,429
He's dylng because someone gave It
to him.

350
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:26,349
And only you and l were the only two
people on earth who knew about it.

351
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,039
No, wait a minute.

352
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,673
Wait a minute.
Maybe he went into your pockets--

353
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,949
No! I had It.

354
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,629
I had the cigarette with the ricin
in my pack this morning.

355
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,149
The last time I saw Brock
was last night.

356
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,397
And this morning, I switched
the cigarette into a new pack.

357
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,511
There's no way Brock took it himself.

358
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,836
Jesse, you're not thinking clearly.

359
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,837
You saId It yourself
that you had It this morning.

360
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,109
When could I have possIbly
gotten It?

361
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,515
You had Saul do it.

362
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,994
-What?
-Yeah.

363
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,952
Yeah. I went to his office.

364
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,036
He called me In,
had to see me today.

365
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,116
His big bodyguard patted me down.

366
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,073
That's when he must have stole It
off me. nght?

367
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,034
That's the plan? Was that the plan?

368
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,438
Jesse.

369
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,438
Why?

370
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,598
Why In God's name
would I polson a child?

371
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,949
To get back at me.

372
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,517
Because I'm helping Gus...

373
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,316
...and this is your way of ripping my
heart out before you're dead and gone.

374
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,237
Just admlt It.

375
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:33,590
Admit what you did. Admit it.

376
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,790
-I did not do this!
-Shut up!

377
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,794
Stop lylngl

378
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,910
Look, I'm not lying.

379
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,112
I'm not lying. Just listen to me.
What would I have to gain?

380
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,551
What possible--? Possible could l--?

381
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,954
Who--? Who would--?

382
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,272
Oh, my God.

383
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,118
Hey.

384
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,189
Stop laughlng.

385
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,913
Stop laughlngl

386
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,389
l have been waiting--

387
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,673
I've been waiting all day...

388
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:21,595
...waltlng for Gus
to send one of his men to kIll me.

389
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,037
And It's you.

390
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,479
Who do you know
who's okay with using children?

391
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,628
Jesse, who do you know who's allowed
children to be murdered?

392
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,273


393
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,798
He has been 10 steps ahead of me
at every turn.

394
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:47,912
And now, the one thing
that he needed to finally get rid of me...

395
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:51,350
...is your consent.
And, boy, he's got that now. He's got it.

396
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,596
And not only does he have that...

397
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,757
...he manipulated you
into pulling the trigger for him.

398
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,599
No, only you and I knew about the ricin.

399
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,791
No, you don't even believe that.

400
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,669
Gus has cameras everywhere.
Please.

401
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,392
Listen to yourself.

402
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,033
No, he has known everything
all along.

403
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,150
Where were you today? In the lab?

404
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,911
You don't think it's possible that Tyrus
lifted the cigarette out of your locker?

405
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,632
Come on.

406
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,078
Don't you see?

407
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,713
You are the last piece of the puzzle.

408
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,989
You are everything that he's wanted.

409
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,996
You're his cook now.

410
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,193
You're the cook and you have proven
that you can run a lab without me.

411
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,233
And now that cook
has a reason to kIll me.

412
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,828
Think about It.

413
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,109
It's brIllIant.

414
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,071


415
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,352


416
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,313
If you think that I am capable
of doing this...

417
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,952
...then go...

418
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,474
...put a bullet In my head
and kIll me right now.

419
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:58,473
-l'll do It.
-Do It!

420
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:01,755
-Do It.
-l'll do It.

421
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,439
Do It.

422
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,558
Do It.

423
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,433
-Where are you going?
-Flnd the son of a bItch...

424
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,311


425
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,233
Don't.

426
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,396
He'll see you coming.

427
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,473
You'll dIe
before you get anywhere near him.

428
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,668
I don't care.

429
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:52,437
Jesse.

430
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,151
Jesse, just get in your car.

431
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,634
Just go.

432
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,637
Just drlve.

433
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,672


434
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,474
I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

435
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,955
Then let me help.

436
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:41,955
Jesus. Mr. Pinkman,
I'm not gonna keep telling you.

437
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,788
Unless the family wants you in there,
you're not allowed.

438
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:48,877
You can't keep coming In here
like this.

439
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,592
You hear me?

440
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,278
You understand?

441
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,790
Mr. Pinkman, I'm gonna call security.

442
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,199
All right, here I go.

443
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,637
Come on now.

444
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,554
Mr. Pinkman, final warning.

445
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,317
Hey.

446
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,118
You need to be at work, now.

447
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:46,677
I already told you. I'm not going.

448
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,591
Got a batch that'll be ruined...

449
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:55,508
...and an employer who will be
very upset if that happens.

450
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,995
And I could give a shit.

451
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,878
I'm not leaving here.

452
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,592
If my employer has a problem with that,
he can tell me himself.

453
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,677
Not his errand boy.

454
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,434
ldlot.

455
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,713
Hey, I don't know this guy.

456
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,310
Call security. I'm being attacked.

457
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,829
Yeah.

458
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,358
That's right.

459
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,951
We've got a situation.

460
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:39,475
He'd like to speak with you.

461
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:42,308
I told you, I'm not leaving.

462
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,636
He's downstairs.

463
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,394
Tyrus told me what's happening.

464
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,630
The sick child.

465
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:11,271
I understand your preoccupation,
but, Jesse, lam running a business.

466
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:14,867
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

467
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:18,476
You can return when you're done.

468
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,711
I can't.

469
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,439
It is, as you must know,
in both of our best interests.

470
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:32,638
That little boy upstairs is dying.

471
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,155
I can't be away.
I don't even wanna be here now.

472
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,749
I can't be away,
If something happens, If he--

473
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:42,393
I am very sorry.

474
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,552
Is there anything I can do?

475
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,115
lam on the board of this hospital.

476
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:50,674
I can recommend doctors...

477
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,474
...make sure he gets
whatever he needs.

478
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,112
The best treatment.

479
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,191
He's not sick.

480
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,590


481
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,233
How did that happen?

482
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,630
The doctors...

483
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,551
...they don't know.

484
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,795
This current batch...

485
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,191
...is surely ruined now, correct?

486
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,790
Stay with the boy.

487
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,109
Tyrus will dump what's there
and clean the tanks.

488
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,269
You will start a new batch
when you are ready to return.

489
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,994
Next week.

490
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,431
There you are.

491
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,158
There you are.

492
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,388
Keep going.

493
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:20,748
Why did you stop?

494
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,669
Why did you stop?

495
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:32,588
Why did you stop?

496
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,590
Come on. Come on.

497
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,559
Come on. Come on.

498
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,040
No, no, no.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

499
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,275


500
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,830
0h, shlt.

501
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,479
