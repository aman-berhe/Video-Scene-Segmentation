1
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,190
Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,315
-What': up, brother?
-Hey, bro.

3
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,830
Thl: I: Itupld.

4
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,711
-You got a battar Idea?
-0kay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,911
-So whon do m, you know?
-Wo don't, for now.

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,236
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,149
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,395
Look, ljuat put my family
through an ordeal...

9
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,878
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't--

10
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,555
That's too expensive.

11
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,109
Look, I can't leave my house...

12
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,594
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,552
I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,435
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,109
Your A-hole brother-ln-lavl
took all my money.

16
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,518
That's $600.

17
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,038
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:16,512
-Reat of what?
-Half your money's mlne.

19
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,835
Flfty-flfty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,077
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:24,156
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,113
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,351
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:40,115
As for now, no contact. Understood?

25
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,554
Where are you going?

26
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,439
I leave f|rst.

27
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,834
-Waltl
-In the kitchen.

28
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,833
Hey.

29
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,996
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,350
Hllarlous, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

31
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,039
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,354
What?

33
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,159
-Good morning, honey.
-Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,793
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,719
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,995
Nice? Follow me.

37
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,077
There's also orange Juice
and grapefruit Juice...

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,113
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,278
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,108
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,513
I wanted to.

42
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:14,477
-Grapefrult Juice?
-Yes, please. Thanks.

43
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,075
There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,510
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:25,990
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,672
-Yeah.
-There you go.

47
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,268
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,313
-No.
-Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,988
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

50
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,918
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,553
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

52
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,749
-That's besides the point.
-Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,439
You too.

54
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,751
-Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
-Boz Scaggs.

55
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,315
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,474
-Bye.
-You're welcome.

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,193
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,752
All right.

59
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,790
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs ls.

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,150
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,795
Come to think of it...

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,514
-...I barely know who Boz Scaggs ls.
-stop It.

63
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,756
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get It. I'll get It. Yeah.

64
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,313
Thank you.

65
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,791
Hey, llsten...

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,116
...in the calendar section...

67
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,670


68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,035
...there's a fiction wrlter's seminar
at UN".

69
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:32,470
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

70
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,069
-...and that sort of thing.
-Yeah?

71
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,868
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you mlght....

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,791
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,790
Oh, and...

74
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,755
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,190
You were wondering
If I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,788
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,915
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,311
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

79
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,518
...to, well, remInd me
to take my medlcatlon.

80
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,513
And, well, the weird thing is that...

81
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,349
...the alarm sound
Is almost exactly the same...

82
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,552
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

83
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,229
...If you ask me.
But I think that was probably It.

84
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,432
ltrled to go In
and change It to a dIfferent sound...

85
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,834
...other than the phone ring, but....

86
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,078
They so overcompllcate
these things.

87
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,476
Anyway, It was probably
Just as well that I lost It.

88
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,709
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,595
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

90
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,712
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,558
Skyler?

92
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,315
Skyler?

93
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:08,157
-Ready?
-Yo, for what, mIght help.

94
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,399
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,230
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

96
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,159
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

97
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:35,236
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

98
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,271
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

99
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:41,836
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

100
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,156
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,668
-lt's your aunt Ginny's house.
-And she gave It to me.

102
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,313
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,158
You were allowed
resIdentlary prlvlleges.

104
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,477
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,229
Look, we talked about this, okay?
l'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,749
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:04,519
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,914
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:10,555
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,955
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,709
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

112
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,548
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

113
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,637
...so you're welcome.

114
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,909
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,949
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,868
l was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

117
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,278
...and I found your laboratory.

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,070
You guys have your own key?

119
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:52,629
Manufacture of a Schedule II
controlled substance...

120
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,469
...is a second degree felony.

121
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,792
Under federal asset seizure...

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,037
...the government can take
the entIre house.

123
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,756
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned It all out.

124
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,348
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

125
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,835
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

126
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,879
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,991
Otherwise,
your parents have authorlsed me...

128
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,476
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,115
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,998
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,233
Come on.

132
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,758
-Hl.
-Hey.

133
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,869
-I fixed the garage door.
-Great.

134
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,433
Yeah.

135
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,200
One track was bent.
That's why It was bounclng.

136
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,878
Okay.

137
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,599
-Where were you today?
-Out.

138
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,711
Is everything okay?

139
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,558
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,912
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

141
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,916
...the cancer support group.

142
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,871
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,633
Yeah.

144
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,630
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,674
You were rIght
on the money about that.

146
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,070
It's good to, you know...

147
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,915
...talk about things.

148
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,437
lthlnk that's great.

149
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,917
Yeah.

150
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,113
Jesse.

151
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,989
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,589
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,031
Yeah, no, I've just been...

154
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,753
...pretty busy. How'd you--?

155
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,554
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,995
Hey, llsten.

157
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,274
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

158
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:31,711
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

159
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,116
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and....

160
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,869
-lt's not just your father, Jesse.
-No, I know. I know. I know.

161
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,074
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

162
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,112
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

163
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,596
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,155
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now....

165
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,715
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this Is good.

166
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,515
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:03,916
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,190
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,718
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,956
-I thought it was just a wake-up call.
-We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:14,275
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,674
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,872
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,231
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,633
I earned thIs.

176
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,069
You dId not make
her lunch every day.

177
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,951
What did you do, huh?

178
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,720
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,115
-Don't start with me.
-Now what?

180
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,471
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,790
Great family, Mom.

182
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,755
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,667
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,588
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,119
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,278
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

187
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,635
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,867
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,991
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,951
Jeez.

191
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,949
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,799
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,274
Come in and say hello.

194
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:45,232
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

195
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:46,434


196
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,473
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

197
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,476
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,319
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,157
-Who's Flynn?
-Flynn.

200
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,237
He's your....

201
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,030
-Flynn?
-Yeah.

202
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,752
So?

203
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,717
So? Nothlng.

204
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,429
-You ready?
-lee It.

205
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,277
-Bye, Mr. White.
-Okay.

206
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,518
Bye.

207
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,428
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thlng?

208
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,149
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As In what, Errol?

209
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,477
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,476
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,591
Don't take it personally.

212
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,635
He wants his own identity.

213
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,392
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,909
-About the blackout?
-Louls Is hIs frIend, Walt...

215
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,587
...and your dIsappearance
upset hIm.

216
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,789
Hey, I made omelettes.

217
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,433
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:11,118
Where you going?

219
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,555
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,235
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,068
-Whlte resIdence.
-Yo, It's me. Is thIs a good tIme?

222
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:31,269
What part of 'no contact'
dIdn't you understand?

223
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,472
-I know, but there's a problem.
-I don't care. We agreed.

224
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,638
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:40,034
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,953
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,871
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,954
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,512
Out.

230
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,395
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,512
Skyler.

232
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,677
-What?
-Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

233
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:13,234
...but I'm In a situation here,
and I need my money.

234
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,078
I just gave you $600.

235
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,508
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

236
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,711
...but that was
before my housIng sItuatIon...

237
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,955
...went completely
testIcular on me, okay?

238
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,070
You smoked the entIre 600,
dIdn't you?

239
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,508
-What? No.
-Yes.

240
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,755
-No.
-Look, Jesse...

241
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,439
...your problems are just that:

242
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,231
Your problems.

243
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:32,033
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:35,948
-When the moment is right, I will call.
-Mr. White, you're not listening.

245
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,275
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,911
You son of a bItch.

247
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,355
Son of a bItch.

248
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,149
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,193
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,870
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,310
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,474
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,751
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

254
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,996
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,951
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,994
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,269
Two nlghts tops.

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,789
No, you still staying

259
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,388
Yeah. I'm thinking of movIng.

260
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,798
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,994
Yeah.

262
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,237
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,395
Too hot.

264
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,512
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,073
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,669
Are you still havIng

267
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,915
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,715
I can't IIe. It's pretty hectlc

269
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,995
Damn. l'm hating, man.

270
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,998
That's why we need to get the Hammer

271
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,636
-Get you out of the house.
-How awesome would that be?

272
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,431
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,997
I cut all the green parts off like you--
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,636
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,908
Get back in the scene.

276
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,834
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all rIght?

277
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,998
Okay, listen. How about

278
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,792
...and then you take--

279
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,475
Mommy's home.

280
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,435


281
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,948
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Plnkman?

282
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,798
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,830
-Hey, Jesse.
-Hey.

284
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,428
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,840
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,477
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

287
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,196
Hey, Hen, lthlnk
It's someone's nap tIme. Come on.

288
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:05,436
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:10,076
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,632
You got other people to call?

291
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,114
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,356
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,876
Yo, In-laws?

294
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,709
-Sucks to be you, P.
-Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

295
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,317
Here.

296
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,873
See you, man.

297
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,991
It's good to see you.

298
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,071
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and--

299
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,113
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

300
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,674
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,233
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:48,189
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,989
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,912
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,077
-You cannot be serIous.
-Hey.

306
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,308
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,430
Not cool.

308
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,350
-Morn|ng.
-Oh, hey.

309
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,879
Morning.

310
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,072
Where did--? Where did Mom go?

311
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,438
Out.

312
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,549
Where's breakfast?

313
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,627
Hey.

314
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,552
Let's go do something.

315
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,312
Like what?

316
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,230
Somethlng fun.

317
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,838
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,919
-Is your foot on the-- Okay. Good.
-Yeah. I got It.

319
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,114


320
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,789
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,432
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:20,834
Okay, let's slow down here...

323
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,031
...to a stop In preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:27,037
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,833
-Sorry about that.
-That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,794
-Much better than last time, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,199
Has he?

328
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,629
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,795
Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.

330
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,308
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:46,238
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,994
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,719
Right hand.

334
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,634
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,835
-Are you usIng both feet?
-Yeah.

336
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,110
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,356
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

338
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,153
-Why not?
-Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,911
-Just stop, please. Right. All right.
-Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,199
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,358
So let's just try It again,
right foot only.

342
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,197
-All right.
-Okay?

343
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,876
Okay, just-- You don't have to--
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,832
Just-- That's okay. That's okay.
Just try It agaln.

345
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,668
Here we go.
Let's just, just try It agaln.

346
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,033
Okay.

347
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:42,470
Don't-- Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,069
That was better. See?
nght? Better? RIght.

349
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,917
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

350
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,518
I can't do thIs.

351
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,798
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,718
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with It.

353
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,718
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,195
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,469
-All right.
-Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,352
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,199
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,870
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,310
Prepare, Wait, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,238
-Braklng.
-You're usIng both feet agaln.

361
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,635
-lt's not stopping.
-That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,558
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,799
Okay.

364
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,118
That's one way to stop.

365
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,752
I told you.

366
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,359
Flynn.

367
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,478
-Hands up, asshole!
-Yo, yo, It's cool.

368
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,238
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,398
No, please, no, all rIght?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

370
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,315
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,034
You towed It.
Your cousln Badger, remember?

372
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,070
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,109
-You smell like shIt.
-lt's a long story.

374
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,709
So I fIxed up your felonIous
rolllng laboratory here...

375
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,069
...750 for the repaIr.

376
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:09,351
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

377
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,111
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,672
Okay.

379
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,873
Here's the thIng.

380
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,399
I can't pay you today.

381
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,875
But I can pay you this week,
all rIght?

382
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,837
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,837
-I thought your word was your bond.
-lt totally ls.

384
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,509
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,910
But I wIll, soon.

386
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,237
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,432
I kick you out.
I take payment from your Inventory.

388
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,154
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,716
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,309
Two days, two grand.
That's totally falr.

391
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,797
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

392
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:00,229
Please, all right?! really....

393
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,992
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:10,756
Clovls, come on.

395
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,997
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff In there.

396
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,794
There's something called
methylamine. Me-- Meth....

397
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:37,308
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,636
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:49,309
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,313
Hey! Hey!

401
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,187
Skyler.

402
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,668
Louis took Wait to school.

403
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:44,590
l was thinking maybe...

404
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,155
...this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,994
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,438
In Ireland.

407
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,953
Welrd.

408
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,998
Sounds weIrd.

409
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,275
I wanted to apologise...

410
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,393
...for everything.

411
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,599
My...

412
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,987
...deslre for privacy.

413
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,677
My emotIonal...

414
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,155
...unavallabIIIty.

415
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,677
HavIng cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,992
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

417
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,718
...and for that...

418
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,352
...l'm very sorry.

419
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,119
I love you.

420
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,997
And ljust...

421
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,278
...want to make sure that...

422
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,275
...we don't lose contact.

423
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,353
Thank you.

424
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,159
Okay.

425
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,638
I agree.

426
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,039
Is that It?

427
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,549


428
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,829
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

429
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,470
-Do what?
-Th|s.

430
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,397
Not talking to me.

431
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,951
Going out all day
and refusIng to tell me where.

432
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,310
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

433
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,556
...so let's talk about it.

434
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,119
Oh, God.

435
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:32,154
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

436
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,510
...that I'm up to something.

437
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,437
-lee what?
-I have no Idea, Skyler.

438
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,711
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

439
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,876
Is that why you asked me
about the....

440
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,310
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

441
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,191
-I don't know.
-Okay.

442
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,197


443
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,039
Why?

444
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:01,431
-Would you even tell me?
-Yes. I would.

445
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,392
Of course, I would.

446
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,627
And no. I'm not.
I'm not havIng an affair, okay?

447
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,399
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

448
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,910
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

449
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,837
I heard you, Walt.

450
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,070
You're not having an affair.

451
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,834
Congratulations.

452
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,348
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

453
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,595
Great job.

454
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,394
-l'm trying to talk to you, and you--
-Okay, so talk, Walt.

455
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:35,031
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

456
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,035
You want to know
what you have to do?

457
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,118
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

458
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:46,038
Today. No more excuses.

459
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,073
No more apologies.
No more of these-- These obvious...

460
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:52,747
...desperate breakfasts.

461
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,072
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

462
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,759


463
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,756
Then tell me.

464
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,712


465
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,351
Tell you what?

466
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,597
Skyler.

467
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,471
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

468
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:41,467
We're not done here. Skyler.

469
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,996
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

470
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:51,918
What the--?

471
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,232
-Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
-What Is wrong with you?

472
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,828
Why are you blue? Jesus.

473
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,315
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

474
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:20,148
-...kleptomaniac douche bags.
-Are you actually this stupid?

475
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:22,077
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal--

476
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:26,238
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

477
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:30,478
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

478
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:33,519
-Nothing. I'm sorry. ljust--
-What if Skyler had seen you?

479
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:36,472
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

480
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,909
-I don't know.
-You know why you don't know?

481
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,190
Because you don't think. That's why.

482
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,994
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

483
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:47,714
I said I was sorry. ljust need
my half of the money, and I will go.

484
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,233
Your half?

485
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:52,828
There is no your half of the money.

486
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,474
There Is only my all of It.
Do you understand?

487
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,830
Why should I be penalised
because of your sloppiness?

488
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,916
Look, that Is completely uncool,
all rIght?

489
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,838
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

490
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,951
Partners In what?
What exactly do you do here?

491
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,232
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

492
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:13,478
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

493
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,673
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

494
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,270
...slmple rudlmentary lnstructlons.
Too stupid to re--

495
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,478
Do It.

496
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,879
Try not to touch anything.

497
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:29,311
Want some breakfast?
