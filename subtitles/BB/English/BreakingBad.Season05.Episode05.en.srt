00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,794
HANK [OVER COMPUTER]:
You know anythlng about GPS trackers
on a methylamlne barrel?

164
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,592
Madrlgal Houston, I'm talklng about.

165
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,188
GOMEZ:
Nope. Nobody from my team
planted anythlng, Why?

166
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,197
HANK:
Oh, I don't know. I ﬁgured as much.

167
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,310
All rlght. Thanks.

168
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,916
I know what you're thlnklng,
but I dldn't do It.

169
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,078
I'm telllng you, I dldn't plant that thlng.
Shut up.

170
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,550
And there you have It, llke l sald.

171
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,637
All rlght. So now what?

172
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,388
It's not the DEA's, so Schrader's
probably thlnklng some crew planted It,

173
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,477
looklng for a weak spot
to pull a helst.

174
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,670
He's gonna send a team
over to that warehouse.

175
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,508
He's gonna wlre It out the wazoo.
Bugs, cameras, the whole nlne yards.

176
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,358
So the warehouse Is too hot.

177
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,834
Her supply Is useless to us now.

178
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,157
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get hls guys there.

179
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,351
We're 900 mlles closer, after all.

180
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,597
I say we keep llstenlng,
suss out how much tlme we have.

181
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,075
If It's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there,

182
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,110
use her securlty code
to galn access,

183
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,992
and we take every barrel we can.

184
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,589
U-Haul can only take
slx or seven before
the suspenslon glves out.

185
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,678
It's a stopgap. But rlght now,
It's the best we can do.

186
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,108
[WHISPERING]
Well, what about her?

187
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,073
MIKE:
You two drlve the
barrels back tonlght.

188
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,834
I'll deal wlth her.

189
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,473
No! No, no, no.
You're maklng a mlstake.

190
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
Thls was not me!
I swear to God I dldn't do It!

191
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:00,907
I don't know. Sounds llke
she's telllng the truth to me.

192
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,917
She has a gun to her head, kld.

193
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,680
Everyone sounds llke Meryl Streep
wlth a gun to thelr head.

194
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,632
I'm sorry, Jesse.

195
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,878
You're the one who wanted
to put It up to a vote.

196
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,991
It's two agalnst one.

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,675
No. No! You can't klll me!
Come on!

198
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,189
I swear I dldn't do anythlngI

199
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,198
HANK:
JanIce, glve me Doughty
In the Houston ofI'Ice, wIII you?

200
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,673
JANICE:
You got It.

201
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,918
Hank Schrader for Mr. Doughty.

202
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,152
He's on the flue.

203
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,750
HANK:
Hey, Erol. Please tell me you guys
dldn't do somethIng as IamebraIned

204
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,395
as put a GPS tracker on the outsIde
of a barrel of methylamlne.

205
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,352
One earmarked for the
Madrlgal warehouse In Houston?

206
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,917
EROL:
Um... Who's askIng?
DId someone ﬁnd them?

207
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,518
HANK:
Jesus. Are you shIttIng me?

208
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,473
SInce when do you put a GPS tracker
on the outsIde ofa barrel?

209
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,194
EROL:
We dldn't have tlme to go In
wlth hazard suIts, Hank.

210
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,436
They were about to shIp.
We epoxIed them to the bottom.
They were well-hldden.

211
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,394
HANK:
Oh, really? Well, not well-hldden
enough. How many barrels you tag?

212
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,353
EROL:
All of them. All the ones
headed to the warehouse, anyway.

213
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,110
HANK:
ChrIst. All rlght. Well, sIt tIght.
Let me ﬁgure out how to play thIs.

214
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,629
Next tlme, a "ﬁle communIcatIon ﬁrst,
all rlght?

215
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,558
EROL: Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Asshole.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,037
Aslde-- Aslde from the fact

217
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,711
that we almost kllled thls woman,
all of those barrels are already marked.

218
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,592
We solve the problem we can.

219
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,473
Thls has not changed the equatlon
one Iota for her.

220
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,309
Oh, come on! You are not serlously
stlll conslderlng kllllng me?

221
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,556
I saved you! If It weren't for me,
we'd all be In ]all rlght now.

222
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,991
I hate to say It,
but she's rlght, Mlke.

223
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,998
She saved our asses
by flndlng that thlng.

224
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,033
She Is savlng herself.
She's a loose cannon.

225
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:52,676
lam telllng you, she wlll
turn a gun or a badge on us
the flrst chance she gets.

226
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,198
The woman put a hlt out on me.

227
00:14:58,839 --> 00:14:59,908
Serlously?

228
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,794
Walt. A hlt? What? lee the mafla?

229
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,594
Yeah, llke the mafla.

230
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,030
Hey! You stlll need methylamlne,
don't you? nght?

231
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,388
You wanna talk methylamlne?

232
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:16,069
Then tell your partner to stop
threatenlng me, and let's talk.

233
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,429
Talk about what? You heard.

234
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,631
You can't even get us
a slngle barrel.

235
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,716
Who sald anythlng about barrels?

236
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,514
I'm talklng about an ocean
of the stuff.

237
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,869
Just glve hlm a mlnute,
would you?

238
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,798
Trust hlm.

239
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,069
'Trust hlm.'

240
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,833
[MIKE OHUOKLES]

241
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,394
WALT:
Okay. So, let's hear It.

242
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:50,750
Not wlthout a guarantee that once
I tell you how to get what you want,

243
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,996
I won't be kllled anyway.
Flne. You have my word.

244
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,316
Not good enough.
Ha. Look, lady--

245
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,148
Do you have chlldren?
That has nothlng to do wlth thls.

246
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,750
It's not a trlck questlon.
Why don't you Just answer It?

247
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,678
Yes, I have chlldren. So what?

248
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,110
You thlnk that somehow
because we're both parents

249
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,514
that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

250
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,199
Swear on thelr llves.
Uh, what?

251
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,754
Swear on your chlldren's llves
that I won't be harmed.

252
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,711
Otherwlse, how can I trust you?

253
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,196
Look, you're
a smart buslnesswoman.

254
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,117
You understand the concept
of leverage.

255
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,755
Please don't patronlse me. I hate that.
You have none.

256
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,797
But trust has to work
both ways, Lydla.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,719
Is It true that you
put a hlt out on Mlke?

258
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,917
Yes.
Why?

259
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,234
l was scared.

260
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,351
Of Mlke?
Not at flrst.

261
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,233
There are men who used to work
wlth Gus Frlng In custody now.

262
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:54,112
Nlne of them. They know
everythlng about me. Everythlng.

263
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,437
Some of them even know about you,
assumlng you're the master chemlst

264
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,710
they're always talklng about.

265
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,708
And If It's these nlne
that you're worrled about,

266
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,990
why put the hlt on Mlke?
I had no cholce.

267
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,556
I'm not golng to prlson and have
my daughter ralsed In a group home.

268
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,909
Do you have any Idea
what those places are llke?

269
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,757
I gave hlm a llst of names

270
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,155
but Instead of handllng It,
he's protectlng them.

271
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,635
So I hlred someone else.
At that polnt, there was no optlon

272
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,876
but to add Mlke to the llst.

273
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,233
Thls ocean of methylamlne

274
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,318
that you clalm
you can get your hands on,

275
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:35,556
how much are we
talklng about, llterally?

276
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,557
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

277
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,348
Once a week, on a Wednesday,
a frelght traln leaves
the Port of Long Beach

278
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,357
loaded wlth Industrlal chemlcals.

279
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,279
There's always at least one tanker car
full of methylamlne

280
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,835
whlch we Import from
a manufacturer In Guangzhou.

281
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,349
The traln travels east
through Arlzona,

282
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,437
stops at a rall yard
outsIde Flagstaff

283
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:01,154
where It gets broken down
and rebullt. But the methylamlne
always moves on,

284
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,033
destlned for our pestlclde concerns
In Texas and Oklahoma.

285
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,912
Whlch means that It passes
rlght through your home state.

286
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,874
There's a remote three-mlle stretch
here In McKInley County.

287
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,877
That's where you do It.

288
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,474
That's where we
do what exactly?

289
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,828
Get your methylamlne.

290
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,715
lee, rob It? lee Jesse James?
LYDIA: You want the stuff?

291
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,955
I'm offerlng you enough
to flll a swlmmlng pool.

292
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,356
You are offerlng us a qulck trlp
to prlson. That's what I'm hearlng.

293
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,629
Stopplng a traln, post 9I11?

294
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,879
You have any Idea how many alarms
that'll set off between here and D.C.?

295
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,628
None, If you do It rlght here.
If a frelght traln Is stopped In translt,

296
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,070
anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots,

297
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,828
absolutely, a slgnal wlll alarm
the FRA and the TSA Surface Dlvlslon

298
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,032
at the Department of Homeland
Securlty. But what you don't know,

299
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:51,754
and I do, because my ]ob requlres me
to keep track of my buyers' shlpments,

300
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,110
thls Is dark terrltory.

301
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,150
What's that?
LYDIA: Traln-speak for an area

302
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,476
of no contact.
It's a dead zone.

303
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,797
No automated supervlslon system,
no alarms, no contact wlth control.

304
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:04,114
What about cell phones?

305
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,833
Crew could Just call the cops.
LYDIA: No cellular elther.

306
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,712
I'm telllng you,
It's the perfect place.

307
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,796
You'd have tlme enough
to stop the traln,

308
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,274
slphon off as much methylamlne
as you can carry,

309
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,677
get away before the pollce are called.
Walt a mlnute. Walt a mlnute.

310
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:20,552
Assumlng we can stop
a movlng traln,

311
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,910
how do we know we have the rlght
one? And whlch tanker car Is whlch?

312
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,587
I can't belleve that they would
advertlse thelr contents.

313
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,870
Once the traln
gets rebullt In Flagstaff,

314
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,548
a flnal manlfest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

315
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,637
I'll have It for you sometlme
between mldnlght and 2 am.

316
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,354
That'll glve you at least
slx hours of lead tlme.
