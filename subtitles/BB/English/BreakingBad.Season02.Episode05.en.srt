7
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,587

00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,276
And your halr should start
to come back.

11
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,797
Klnd ot' gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:58,151
-I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
-Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:02,557
So no more confusion?

14
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,072
-No more--?
-No. No. Absolutely none.

15
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,598
How are you two holding up?

16
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,755
Flne.

17
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,952
I mean, you know, we're busy...

18
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,719
...but we're good. Absolutely.

19
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,598
It's all good.

20
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,232
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,237
Yes. Direct blll.

22
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,794
Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,678
Thank you.

24
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,350
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

25
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:15,073
Absolutely. lt's included.

26
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,952
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:21,754
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,154
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,793
Okay.

30
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,632
Congratulations.

31
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,518
Thank you.

32
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,718
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

33
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,876
Can you--?
Can you please explain to me...

34
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,118
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

35
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,232
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered It.

36
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,872
Okay, you know,
It should be covered.

37
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,238
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

38
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,351
Yeah. Okay.

39
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,038
Bitch.

40
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,839


41
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,277
Been around someone
who smokes?

42
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,673


43
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,790
The hospital bill came.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,877
-That was fast.
-Yeah.

45
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,992
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,319


47
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:49,478
...I know It's strlctly your domain,
but....

48
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,670
They will. I'm sure they will.

49
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,437
I'll handle It.

50
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,476
Oh, God.

51
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,711
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

52
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:29,908
-Dead.
-stlll?

53
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,235
-Completely.
-Okay, then.

54
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,874
-Well, thanks for stopping by.
-Okay.

55
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,836
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

56
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,270
-Good.
-Of course, that's not gonna last.

57
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,313
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

58
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,872
No takers so far?

59
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,277
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Helsenberg.

60
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,789
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

61
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,195
-Helsenberg?
-Yeah, I know.

62
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,959
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

63
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,118
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

64
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,675
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

65
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,073
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

66
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,391
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

67
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:17,988
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

68
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,191
...in pursuit of their prey.

69
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,276
Yeah, I think I heard that.

70
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,274
You, my friend, are a great white.

71
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,271
How does Albuquerque liaison...

72
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,677
...Tri-State Border lnterdiction
Task Force sound?

73
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,918
Like one hell of a promotion.

74
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,634
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

75
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:41,148
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

76
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,317
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

77
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,955
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

78
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,832
Hey, buddy,

79
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,348
-l'm the whole package.
-l'm glad I didn't Just eat.

80
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,915
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

81
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,680
-You wanna grab lunch?
-Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

82
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,519
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstalrs.

83
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,597
Try not to get lost on the way.

84
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,711
Schrader.

85
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,988
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

86
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,714
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

87
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,512
Yeah, El Paso.

88
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,913
Here's the man.

89
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,908
-Hey, congratulations, Hank.
-Thanks.

90
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:21,232
Gets two In the sand,
two In the forest, you know?

91
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,591
And then he says,
'lee me a four,' you know?

92
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,357
Hey. Hey.

93
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,709
-Hey.
-Got some nerve coming back here.

94
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,751
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

95
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,995
Yeah, well, maybe both.

96
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,718
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

97
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,515
...and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

98
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,392
...the toilet.

99
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,795
Look, like I said...

100
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,753
...my word is my bond.

101
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:46,553
What would you charge me
to store this here?

102
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,558
-A mIllIon-flve.
-Come on, yo.

103
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,875
-Your slster.
-Dog, I'm serious, all right?

00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,517
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

105
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,028
We could, you know, negotiate.

106
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,269
Five hundred.

107
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,707
-A month?
-A week.

108
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,519

109
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,277
-See you.
-Wa|t, waIt, waIt.

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,596

What about that one?

123
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,438
Serlous?

124
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,794
It's Jane, rlght?

125
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:39,309
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place Is awesome.

126
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,353
-Really? Does it inspire awe?
-No. I mean, you know, it's great.

127
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,868
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

128
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,833
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

129
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,192
...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

130
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,277
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

131
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,069
Jesus.

132
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,514
Utilities are included.

133
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,438

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,712
Bedroom.

138
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,989


139
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,237

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,438
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

145
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,553
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2

...former address, you know,

147
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:45,954
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

148
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,633
Yeah. Look...

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,998


151
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,599
Unbelievable.

152
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,269
-l'm just currently between situations.
-Then I'm currently not renting.

153
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:01,949
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

154
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,469
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

155
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,147
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

156
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,429
-Trust me.
-Your dad?

157
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,313
Owns the place. I manage it.

158
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,635
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

159
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,477
Or go run your game
somewhere else.

160
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,796
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This Is It.

161
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:22,274
And I got no game, all right?

162
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,994
I just need a chance.

163
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,356
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

164
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,392
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

165
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,352
Didn't meet their expectations again.

166
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,232
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

167
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,399
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

168
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:46,908
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

169
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,952
lwIll not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

170
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,709
Rent just went up.

171
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,594
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

172
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,278
Yes.

173
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,432
Okay. Yes.

174
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:09,233
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

175
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,034
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

176
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,594
DBAA fee, non-refundable.

177
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,156
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

178
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,827
All right. So, what's DBAA?

179
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,269
-Don't be an asshole.
-Gotcha.

180
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,914
-I live next door.
-Really?

181
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,316
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

182
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,999
If you blow this, I want you gone.

183
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,158
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster...

184
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,679
...faster than you can blink.

185
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,030
l'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

186
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,467
Which is what, by the way?

187
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,875
It's Jesse.

188
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,715
Jesse Jackson.

189
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,795
Seriously?

190
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,554
What?

191
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,068
-What are you doing?
-Beating off. What's it look like?

192
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,589
That Is In fact exactly
what It looks like to me.

193
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,757
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

194
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,837
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

195
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,109
So let me get this straight.

196
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,711
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited...

197
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:05,149
...career-boosting promotion...

198
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,478
...so you can play Oktoberfest
In your man cave?

199
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,958
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

200
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:14,036
Babe, relax.

201
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,439
-Please, don't tell me to relax.
-Sorry, I forgot.

202
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:19,550
-You know I hate that.
-nght.

203
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,431
Dave said I should express that.

204
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:24,233
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

205
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,679
I can take a day.

206
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:28,517


207
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,477
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

208
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,558
Okay, so, what's the plan?

209
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,954
The plan Is we cook.

210
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,391
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

211
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,467
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

212
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,274
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

213
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,198
-Dude.
-What?

214
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,114
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't It?

215
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,596
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

216
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,871
-...but still, what choice do we have?
-First of all, there's no we.

217
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,993
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

218
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,349
I got profile now.

219
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,631
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

220
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,071
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

221
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,714
-No way.
-Then what do you suggest?

222
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,595
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

223
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,714
I got bllls, man.

224
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,148
You've got bIlls?

225
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,112
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

226
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,037
I've already lost more than
I've made...

227
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,799
...and I am tIred
of dlcklng around out here.

228
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:30,911
You wanna know how much
I've got left?

229
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,110
After completing
my first round of treatment...

230
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,676
...and financing
the world's most expensive alIbI?

231
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:38,756
Zero. le. Nothing.

232
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,918
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

233
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,395
...which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

234
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:52,594
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

235
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,711
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices.

236
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,831
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

237
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,995
...or you and I start--

238
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:04,794
You selling whatever you can.

239
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,590
There's a third way.

240
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,837
And what would that be?

241
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:17,551
We got to be Tuco.

242
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:20,034
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

243
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:23,914
So you're going to what?

244
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,189
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

245
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:29,311
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

246
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,877
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

247
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,789
Look, we control production
and distribution.

248
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,071
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

249
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,192
I mean, the point here Is
to make money, right?

250
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,628
Sky-high stacks.

251
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,318
-No.
-No? That's not the point?

252
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,988
No, lam not willing to do that.

253
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:54,710
Who said anything about you?

254
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,670
I don't vote for this plan.

255
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:03,872
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

256
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,514
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

257
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,076
I beg your pardon?

258
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,908
-This is a partnership, remember?
-I rem-- Oh, I remember.

259
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,155
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

260
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,511
That was the division of labour
when we started all this.

261
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,789
And that's exactly
how we should have kept It.

262
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,718
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

263
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,036
...or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

264
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:31,072
...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

265
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,996
All right, lwIll admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

266
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,987
And perhaps
I was overly ambItIous.

267
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,108
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

268
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,911
Yeah, damn straight.

269
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,030
Know why?

270
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,912
Because we do things
my way this tIme...

271
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,871
...or I walk.

272
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:03,391
You need me more than
I need you, Walt.

273
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,119
Yo, enter my casa.
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?

274
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,274
What up with it, yo?

275
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,597
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

276
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,439
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

277
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,439
-Yo, Badge, hey.
-Cool crIb, man.

278
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,197
Hey, It echoes.

279
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,958


280
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,036
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

281
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,877
Let me give you the virtual tour,
okay?

282
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,514
So plasma is gonna go right here.

283
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,676
Probably llke 50-Inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

284
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:52,995
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

285
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,792
No. They burn In, yo.

286
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:57,991
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

287
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,667
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

288
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,471
That's what I'm waiting for.

289
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,795
-Porn, coz. You know?
-Jesus.

290
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,388
lee 3-D tatas,
like right In your face.

291
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,279
...for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

292
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,549
Those are buck.

293
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:17,637
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

294
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,876
-Feng shul, yo. I can dIg It.
-Yeah.

295
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,195
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles...

296
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,708
...maybe one of those
little fountaln jobs right here.

297
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,637
-lt's gonna be chlll.
-The ladIes...

298
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,435
...they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

299
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,628
You are going to score, big time.

300
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,116
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

301
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,312
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

302
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,989
You got any other refreshments?

303
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:47,952
-I could kick It. It's been a while.
-Yes, yes.

304
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,468
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

305
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,830
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

306
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,509
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

307
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,230
Okay? So IIsten up.

308
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,955
This Is how It goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

309
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,913
You sell It for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

310
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,758
No cuttlng It.
You sell It as Is, all right?

311
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,315
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

312
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,952
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

313
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,470
-Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 10.
-Seventeen.

314
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,229
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

315
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,716
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

316
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,911
...who else Is selllng right now,

317
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,031
-lt's dry out there, that's for sure.
-Church.

318
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:33,356
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

319
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,597
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

320
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,916
Short me, you're out.

321
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,632
Cut It, you're out.

322
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,398
Perlod.

323
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,354
This Is a bIg opportunity
I am giving you.

324
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,038
Understand?

325
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:50,753
Badger, what is this?

326
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,392
A bIg opportunity.

327
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,910
Exactly. All right?
This Is the ground floor.

328
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,475
Gentlemen,
how far you go Is up to you.

329
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,078
So bring out the product, yo.

330
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,918
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

331
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,907
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

332
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:15,517
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

333
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,438
Now, I got mad volume.

334
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:21,154
So you move It quick,
you move It rlght...

335
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,352
...there is always more.

336
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,877
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

337
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,196
Apply yourselves.

338
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:32,434
Hell, yeah.

339
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,557
Hell, yeah.

340
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,629
Hey, there's the big guy.

341
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,990
-Congratulatlons, Uncle Hank.
-Hey, Hank.

342
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,315
It's an armplt.

343
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,191
It's not an armplt.

344
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,958
Oh, excuse me.

345
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,593
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

346
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,074
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

347
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,510
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

348
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,711
Human heads, they leave.

349
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,832
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

350
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,314
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

351
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,954
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

352
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,912
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

353
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,633
You just do your time
like a good boy...

354
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,673
...and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

355
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:46,551
...In a couple of years.

356
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,988
I went online to this fantastic...

357
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,998
...real estate website for DC.

358
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,796
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

359
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,955
l was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wlfe.

360
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,072
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

361
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,396
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there--

362
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,473
Apologlse.

363
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,079
What?

364
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:38,468
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologise.

365
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,038
-For?
-You know perfectly well, Marle.

366
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:47,117
-Well, obviously I don't--
-Your IIes.

367
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,832
To me.

368
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,235
The shopllftlng.

369
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,953
All of It.

370
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,437
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

371
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:01,597
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it--

372
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,553
Apologlse.

373
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:08,835
Now or never. I mean it.

374
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,394
Or it'll never be the same.

375
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,948
Why are you punishing me?

376
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,949
If you don't respect me enough to
apologise, to tell me the truth, then--

377
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,437
I need my sister back.

378
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,477
I'm sorry.

379
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:54,591
I'm sorry.

380
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,191
-What, do you want the gory details?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

381
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,118
No, you don't.

382
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,117
Keep you up at night.

383
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,749
So was It scary?

384
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:20,393
Hell, yeah, It was freaklng scary,
you little punk.

385
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,589
Jesus.

386
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,552
But you were way faster than him.

387
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,037
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

388
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,831
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

389
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,313
Kick ass and take names.

390
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,192
-Son.
-No, It's fine.

391
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:37,116
You know what it is?

392
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,835
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

393
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,871
I mean, you don't think about it.

394
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,630
You stomp them down.

395
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,672
Where do they come from?

396
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,587
Criminals, like the one you....

397
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,348
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

398
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,832
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

399
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:06,030
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

400
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,399
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

401
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,835
Cops.

402
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,038
Copsl

403
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,636
Wasn't sure it was you.

404
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,793
New car?

405
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:25,628
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

406
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,832
I'm guessing
this one doesn't bounce.

407
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,591
Your half.

408
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,155
Flfteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

409
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,198
You're welcome.

410
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,389
Jesus.

411
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,876
Help me understand the math,
okay?

412
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,876
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

413
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:55,877
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

414
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,798
$1,000 each.

415
00:36:57,999 --> 00:36:59,830
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

416
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,670
Sixteen ounces should net
to me $16,000.

417
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,713
Sixteen. Not 15.

418
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,598
Something came up.

419
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,313
Something came up?

420
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,478
One of my guys got held up
by a couplejunkies.

421
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,070
Lost an ounce. But It's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

422
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,633
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed--

423
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,960
Or rather you got robbed.
--but it doesn't matter.

424
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,513
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

425
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,357
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

426
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,436
And you're thinking
this Is acceptable?

427
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,597
It's the cost of business, yo.

428
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:43,198
You're sweating me over a grand?

429
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,632
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

430
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,990
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage...

431
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,157
...ls just you making a fool
of yourself.

432
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,075
I've got another technical
term for you.

433
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,910
Non-sustainable business model.

434
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,270
You're focusing on the negative.

435
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,915
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

436
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,830
What happens when
word gets out...

437
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,316
...and It's open season
on these clowns you've hlred?

438
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,318
Once everyone knows that
Jesse Plnkman...

439
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,432
...drug lord,
can be robbed wlth lmpunlty.

440
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,868


441
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,390
You think Tuco had breakage?

442
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:26,111
I guess it's true, he did.

443
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:27,388
He broke bones.

444
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:31,396
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

445
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,989
You want another grand?
Is that It?

446
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,349
-That's not my point.
-Take It. Here.

447
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,838
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

448
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,109
Hey, we're making bank.
Shlt happens.

449
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,834
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

450
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,313


451
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,114
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

452
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,073
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

453
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:58,032
You've made
the division of labour very clear.

454
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:02,715
Yo, I mean, seriously...

455
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,276
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

456
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:33,354
Hey.

457
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,753
Sorry.

458
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,631
Wow, you snuck In.

459
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,831
Didn't even know you were home.

460
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,069
What you eating?

461
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,191
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

462
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,997
I thought we nixed those, huh?

463
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,837
DId we?

464
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,271
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

465
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,871
I had a craving.

466
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,150
Once in a while is no big deal.

467
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,552
So where's Jr.?

468
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:08,633
Out.

469
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,035
With whom?

470
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,638
Louls.

471
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:19,475
Out where?

472
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,718
Somewhere. I don't know.

473
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,593
-He'll be back by 9.
-Okay.

474
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,915
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

475
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,633
Why don't you?

476
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:38,918
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

477
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,428
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

478
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,790
Just pick up the phone like I do.

479
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,399
Great.

480
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,071
Perhaps you might know
something...

481
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,394
...about this.

482
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,115
Perhaps.

483
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,029
And then again...

484
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,156
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

485
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,669
Perhaps I smoked them
In a fugue state.

486
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,556
I'd like an explanation, please.

487
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,513
-You don't wanna go down that road.
-Why would you do this?

488
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,632
-You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
-Three and a half cigarettes...

489
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,238
...won't do a thing to the baby.

490
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:33,475
-Nothlng.
-l'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

491
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,147
Three and a half. That was It.
I tossed the rest.

492
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:42,071
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

493
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,758
Skyler, this--
I mean, this Is something that--

494
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:51,076
-Thls Is so unlike you. Why--?
-Really?

495
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:53,110
How would you know?

496
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:57,750
No, thank you.

497
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,028


498
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,548
Jesus.

499
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,791
Yo.

500
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,991
You asked me what
I want you to do.

501
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,307
I want you to handle it.
