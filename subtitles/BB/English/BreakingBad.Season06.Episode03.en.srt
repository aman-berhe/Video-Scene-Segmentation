You're not gonna negotlate

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,952
Let'a go.

277
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,274
My name Ia Walter Hartwell Whlte.

278
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,993
I llve at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane...

279
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,670
...Albuquerque, New Mexlco, 87104.

280
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,475
Thla Ia my confeaalon.

281
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,956
If you're watchlng thla tape...

282
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,232
...l'm probably dead...

283
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,076
...murdered by my brother-In-Iaw,
Hank Schrader.

284
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,758
Hank has been bulldlng
a meth emplre...

285
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,555
...for over a year now
and ualng me as hla chemlat.

286
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,319
Shortly after my 50th blrthday...

287
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,715
...he aaked that I use
my chemlatry knowledge...

288
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:20,878
to cook methamphetamlne,
whlch he would then aell...

289
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,710
...ualng connectlona that he made
through hla career wlth the DEA.

290
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,670
I was astounded.

291
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:34,157
I.... I always thought Hank
was a very moral man...

292
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,238
...and! was partlcularly
vulnerable at the tlme...

293
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,115
...somethlng he knew
and took advantage of.

294
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:44,707
I was reellng
from a cancer dlagnosls...

295
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,434
...that was polsed
to bankrupt my famIIy.

296
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,472
Hank took me on a rIde-along
and showed me just how much money...

297
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,352
...even a small meth operatlon
could make.

298
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,592
And! was weak.

299
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,792
I dldn't want my famIIy
to go Into ﬂnancIaI ruln...

300
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,478
...so I agreed.

301
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:07,918
Hank had a partner, a buslnessman
named Gustavo Frlng.

302
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,077
Hank sold me Into servltude
to thla man...

303
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:14,470
...and when I trled to qult,
Frlng threatened my famIIy.

304
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,557
I dldn't know where to turn.

305
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,475
Eventually, Hank and Frlng
had a faIIIng out...

306
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,591
...and thlngs escalated.

307
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,395
Frlng was able to arrange...

308
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,470
...I guess--
I guess you call It a hlt on Hank.

309
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,433
It faIIed,
but Hank was serlously Injured...

310
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,789
...and I wound up
paylng hla medIcaI bIIIs...

311
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:40,878
...whlch amounted
to a llttle over $177, 000.

312
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,119
Upon recovery,
Hank was bent on revenge.

313
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,953
Worklng wlth a man
named Hector Salamanca...

314
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,956
...he plotted to M" Frlng.

315
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,755
The bomb that he used
was buIIt by me.

316
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,548
He gave me no optlon In that.

317
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,476
I have often contemplated suIcIde...

318
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,795
...but I'm a coward.

319
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,394
I wanted to go to the poIIce...

320
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:13,392
...but I was frlghtened.

321
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:18,157
Hank had rlsen to become the head
of the Albuquerque DEA.

322
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,432
To keep me In "M,
he took my chlldren.

323
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:24,107
For three months he kept them.

324
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,516
My wlfe had no Idea
of my crImInaI actIvItIes...

325
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,473
...was horrlﬂed to learn
what I had done.

326
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,992
I was In hell.

327
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,269
I hated myself for what
I had brought upon my famlly.

328
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:47,630
Recently, I trled once agaln to qult...

329
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,719
...and In response, he gave me thla.

330
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,955
I can't take thla anymore.

331
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:08,074
I llve In fear every day
that Hank wlll klll me...

332
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,192
...or worse, hurt my famlly.

333
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:19,391
All I could thlnk to do
was to make thla vldeo...

334
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,799
...and hope that the world
wlll flnally see thla man...

335
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,635
...for what he really ls.

336
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,957
Who do you thlnk he's shown thls to?

337
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,832
No one. It's a threat.

338
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:49,518
It's what he wlll do II I don't back off.

339
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,191
lthlnk you should show thls to Ramey.

340
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,355
Just get ahead of It.

341
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,189
That vldeo Is a bunch of lles, Hank.
Anybody who knows you wlll know.

342
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:01,436
A hundred and seventy-seven
thousand dollars?

343
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,076
Hell Is he talklng about?

344
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,272
Marle?

345
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,918
They told me It was gambllng money.

346
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,190
What was gambllng money?

347
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,716
Oh, Jesus Chrlst, Marle.

348
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,353
-Oh, God, no.
-How was I supposed to know?

349
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,312
How was I to know
where It came from?

350
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:37,317
Why were they paylng for my bllls?
What about my Insurance?

351
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,228
Insurance wouldn't have covered
the treatment you needed, and l....

352
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,868
-I wanted the best for you.
-Why dldn't you tell me?

353
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,230
Because I knew that
you would refuse It...

354
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:49,511
...and wlthout It, you may never
have been able to walk agaln.

355
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,199
Oh, Chrlst, Marle.

356
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,952
You kllled me here.

357
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,028
I mean, It's the-- It's the last nall.

358
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,156
That's the last nall In the cofﬁn.

359
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,437
What do we do?

360
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,040
II I were you, I'd be more nervous.

361
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,233
Jesus.

362
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,839
It's always the desert.

363
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,393
I already checked It.

364
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,398
It's clean.
I wouldn't have drlven It here It It wasn't.

365
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,590
Get one of these, by the way.

366
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,837

367
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,279

368
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,994
I mean, he knows you're Helsenberg.

369
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,076
But I Ilgure not much else...

370
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,270
...otherwlse, you know,
you'd be locked up.

371
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,950
What dld he say exactly?

372
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,111
He wants me to Inform on you

374

Anythlng else?

375
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,789
I don't thlnk he's told

376
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,152
Why do you say that?

377
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,954

...and, plus,
he was actlng klnd oI' shady.

379
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:29,114

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,311
...hearlng what he had to say.

381
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,669
Are we gonna talk about the raln oI' caca

382
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:38,552
Want to hazard a guess
what hls llttle charlty drlve cost you?

383
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,715
Why don't you go take a walk, Saul?

Jesse, wlll you let me help you?

385

388
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,237

390
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,193
Maybe It's tlme for you to Just...

391
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,347
...leave all of thls behlnd.

392

Just get out of town.

393
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,032

00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,835

...and set you up
