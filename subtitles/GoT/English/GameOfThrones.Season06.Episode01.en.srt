from men like that all my life.

533
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,676
In my learned opinion, we open that door...

534
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,033
And they'll slaughter us all.

535
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,429
They want to come in, they're gonna come in.

536
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,636
Aye, but we don't need to
make it easy forthem.

537
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:49,437
Edd is our only chance.

538
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,114
It's a sad fucking statement
if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

539
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,514
There's always the Red Woman.

540
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,194
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

541
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:02,193
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.
