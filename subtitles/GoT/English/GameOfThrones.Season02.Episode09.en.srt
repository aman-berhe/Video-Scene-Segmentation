357
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:43,948
Here.

358
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,713
Sit.

359
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,914
Drink.

360
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,070
Not like that. Drink, girl.

361
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,430
I should have been born a man.

362
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,397
I'd rather face a thousand swords

363
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,789
than be shut up inside
with this flock of frightened hens.

364
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,630
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.

365
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,797
It was expected of me,

366
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,236
as it will be ofyou
ifyou ever become Joffrey's queen.

367
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,310
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

368
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,277
these hens will return to their cocks

369
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,150
and crow of how my courage inspired them,

370
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,071
lifted their spirits.

371
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,912
And ifthe city should fall?

372
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,678
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

373
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:35,751
The Red Keep should hold for atime,

374
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,151
long enough for me to go to the walls
and yield to Lord Stannis in person.

375
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,875
If it were anyone else outside those gates,

376
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,797
I might have hoped for a private audience,

377
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:47,029
but this is Stannis Baratheon.

378
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:51,029
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

379
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:56,389
Have I shocked you, little dove?

380
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:59,039
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

381
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,555

382
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,234
Learn how to use it. Drink.

383
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:13,428
Do you have any notion of what happens
when a city is sacked?

384
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,795
No, you wouldn't, would you?

385
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,628
lfthe city falls, these fine women

386
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,832
should be in for a bit ofa rape.

CERSEI: When we were young, Jaime and I,

427
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:01,993
we looked so much alike
even our father couldn't tell us apart.

428
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,515
I could never understand why
they treated us differently.

429
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:09,868
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

430
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,470
and I was taught to smile

431
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,352
and sing and please.

432
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,950
He was heir to Casterly Rock,

433
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,033
and I was sold to some stranger like a horse

434
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,950
to be ridden whenever he desired.

435
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,271
You were Robert's queen.

436
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,395
And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.

439

That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.

440
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,069
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

441
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,909
Straighten your back and bend.

442
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,551
Better. You learn fast.

443
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:01,231
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

444
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,718
A few weeks, Your Grace.

445
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,111
When did you leave Lorath?

446
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,951
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

447
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,514
But she was a nobleman's daughter.

448
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,715
You're not.

449
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,318
When did you come to Westeros?

450
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,392
Ten years ago, Your Grace.

451
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,947
From Lorathi commonerto the Red Keep
in 10 years,

452
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,788
all without learning how to curtsy.

453

464
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:12,474

have landed outside the city walls.

00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,478
-Why isn't he with us?
-MAN 14: Who are we fighting for?

535
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,393
Who leads us?

536
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:54,197
I'll lead the attack.

537

-They say I'm half a man.
-(BANG|NG ON DOOR)

545
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,040
But what does that make the lot of you?

546
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,554
The only way out is through the gates.

547
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:22,958
And they're at the gates.

548
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,348
There's anotherway out.
I'm going to show you.

549
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,878
We'll come out behind them
and fuckthem in their arses.

Don't fight foryour king

00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,275
and don't fight for his kingdoms.

555
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,790
Don't fight for honour. Don't fight for glory.

556
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,155
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

557
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,994
This is your city Stannis means to sack.

558
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,752
That's your gate he's ramming.

559
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,957
If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns,

560
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,838
your gold he steals,

561
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,237

Those are brave men knocking at our door.

565
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,675
Let's go kill them.

LANCEL: The battle is lost, Your Grace.

568
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,958
Stannis' troops are at the gates.

569
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:41,633
When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,

570
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,676
they lost all heart.

571
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,113
Where is my son?

572
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,031
I want to escort him back to the battle.

573
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,792
Why do I care what you want?

574
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:51,187

576
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,358
Don't be afraid.
The queen has raised the drawbridge.

577
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,635
This is the safest place we can be.

578
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,472
Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.

579
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,437
His knights have rallied behind him.

580
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,669
They will save the city.

581
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,233
Shall we sing a hymn?

582

You must go.

586
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,189
Run to your chamber and bar your door.

587
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,192
Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

588
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:35,757
-Come with me.
-I need to say goodbye to someone.

589
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,830
The queen said they'd rape everyone.

590
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,513
No one is raping me.

591
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,592
Go. Run.

Not here for long.

-|'m going.
-Where?

600
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,155
Someplace that isn't burning.

601
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:36,752
North, might be.

602
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:38,593
Could be.

603
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:41,311
What about the king?

604
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:44,953
He can diejust fine on his own.

605
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,391
I can take you with me.

606
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:55,270

I'll be safe here.

Stannis won't hurt me.

611
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,913
Look at me.

612
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,232
Stannis is a killer.

613
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,474
The Lannisters are killers.

614
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,072
Your fatherwas a killer.

615
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:26,830
Your brother is a killer.

616
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:30,231
Your sons will be killers someday.

617
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,830
The world is built by killers.

618
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,358
So you'd better get used to looking at them.

619
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,198
You won't hurt me.

620
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,155

I'll tell you a story.

639

You know the one about
the mother lion and her little cub?

640
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,707
-They lived in the woods.
-The Kingswood?

641
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,233
Yes, my love.

642
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,230
In the Kingswood,
there lived a mother and her cub.

643
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,117
She loved him very much.

644
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:34,951
But there were otherthings
that lived in the woods. Evil things.

645
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,314
Like what?

646
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:40,038
Like stags.

647
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,513
Stags aren't evil.

648
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,318
They only eat grass.

649
00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:46,158
And wolves.

650
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:47,638
My lord.

00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,630
CERSEI: He could hearthem
howling in the night.

652
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:51,915
The little cub was frightened.

653
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,118
His mother said, "You are a lion, my son.
You mustn't be afraid.
