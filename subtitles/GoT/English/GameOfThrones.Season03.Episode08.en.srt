for herwhen the mob had her on her back.

Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none.

You could have
freed me yesterday or tomorrow,

198

but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife

199
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:51,348
because you knew I'd counsel restraint.

200

say it because you believe it yourself.

slaughters innocents for gain or glory.

"I don't ever want to die."

204
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:12,995

"You won't, child. You won't ever."

205
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,358
I hated the idea
of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.

206
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,876
I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods

207
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,713
because they wanted their
children to sleep through the night.

208

And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

211
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,793
