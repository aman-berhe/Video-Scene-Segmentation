178
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,354
Correct.

179
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,952
A student of history, are you?

180
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,992
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

181
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:40,993
Visenya rode Vhagar.

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,230
I'm sure I knewthat when l was a boy.

183
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,154
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

184
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,279
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

185
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,674
Hmm.

186
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,432
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

187
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,237
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

188
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,436
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

189
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,317
-Most girls are idiots.
-(LAUGHS)

190
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,310
You remind me of my daughter.

191
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,356
Where did you learn all this stuff about
Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?

192
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,393
From my father.

193
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,875
He was a well-read stonemason.

194
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:27,317
Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

195
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,512
Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

196
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:34,474
Careful now, girl.

197
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,111
I enjoy you, but be careful.

198
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,591
Take that back to the kitchen.

199
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,474
Eat what you want.

200
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,194
And, girl.

201
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,629
"M'lord."

202
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,030
Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"

203
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,113
not "my lord."

204
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,798
lfyou're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

205
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,669
My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.

206
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,200
She taught me how to speak proper...
Properly.

207
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,917
You're too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?

208
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:16,712
Yes.

209
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,595
Go on.

210
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,471
I beg pardon, ser.

211
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,075
I should have come to you after
to thank you for saving me.

212
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,635
-You were so brave.
-Brave?

213
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,069
A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.

214
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,790
Does it give you joy to scare people?

215
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,670
No, it gives mejoy to kill people.

216
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,039
Spare me. You can't tell me

217
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,917
Lord Eddard Stark ofWinterfell
never killed a man.

218
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,668
It was his duty. He never liked it.

219
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,271
Is that what he told you?

220
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,474
He lied.

221
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,232
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

222
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,636
Why are you always so hateful?

223
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,190
You'll be glad ofthe hateful things I do
someday when you're queen

224
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,397
and I'm all that stands between you
and your beloved king.

225
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,911
l've demanded a meeting ofthe Thirteen.
One ofthem did this or knows who did.

226
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,557
You are one ofthe Thirteen.

227
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:29,630
If I wanted your dragons,
lwould have taken them.

228
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,678
-They mean nothing to me on their own.
-Nothing?

229
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,230
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

230
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,708
Shall we look inside my vault

231
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,791
and see what selling your dragons
would buy me I cannot buy already?

232
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,799
We will get them back.

233
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,359
There is no we,
so why would you help me get them back?

234
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:49,749
I took you under my protection
in front ofthe rulers of my city.

235
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,070
A man is what others say he is and no more.

236
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,993
lfthey say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
my word is worth nothing.

237
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,348
I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.

238
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,556
But it did happen underyour roof.

239
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,870
Khaleesi, manytimes in my life, l have been...

240
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,518
I don't care where you've been.

241
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,429
You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.

242
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,115
We can't make steel as good as yours,
it's true, but...

243
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,799
We're free.

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,753
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,

245
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,956
we'd shove a spear up his arse.

246
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,715
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.

247
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,552
No.

248
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,313
No, you serve Mance Rayder,
the King beyond the Wall.

249
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,675
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

250
00:16:56,359 --> 00:17:00,511
He was a crow, same as you,
but he wanted to be free.

251
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,197
You could be free, too.

252
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,634
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

253
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,230
Wake up when you want to wake up.

254
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,751
I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.

255
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,036
Build yourself a cabin and
find awoman to lie with in the night.

256
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,792
You're a pretty lad.

257
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:25,038
The girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.

258
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,908
Walk.

259
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,271
I could teach you how to do it.

260
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,358
I know how to do it.

261
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,436
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

262
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,268
And what did she say?

263
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,874
She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

264
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,192
And what then?

265
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,834
She...

266
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:24,314
If every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,

267
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:25,514
we'd all hang.

268
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,788
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

269
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:33,274
You've acted with honour.

270
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,952
I thank you for it.

271
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,751
Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's
pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

272
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,399
Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

273
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,470
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

274
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,558
Too many prisoners.

275
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:49,151
Is there room for Ser Alton?

276
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,630
Does he need to lie down?

277
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,312
Have the men build him a new pen.

278
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,998
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

279
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,993
Have your boy watch over them.

280
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,713
Torrhen.

281
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,954
That will be all.

282
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,038
Aminute ofyourtime?

283
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,275
I've been treating your wounded men.

284
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,874
And my enemies, as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

285
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:36,673
They're not my enemies.

286
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,871
That's what I tell my bannermen.

287
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,674
I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.

288
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,718
Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

289
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,954
But some are not.

290
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,396
I need silk for stitching.

291
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,472
I need fennel root for those with fever,
willow bark. Mostly I need milk ofthe poppy.

292
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,156
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

293
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,871
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

294
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,519
-|fyou need help finding these...
-I know where to find them.

295
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,995
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

296
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,918
Continue, my lady.

297
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,354
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

298
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,589
Yes.

299
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,558
The Crag will have a maester
and he will have what I need.

300
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,793
I expect he will.

301
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,870
lfl could write a list.

302
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,711
Come with me to the Crag.

303
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,955
I don't thinkthat will be...

304
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,996
Let the maester show you his stores.

305
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,428
I want the wounded men to be treated well,

306
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,037
all the wounded men.

00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,433
Hurry up!

MAN: Can't find anything, ser.

311
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,594
-They've lost the scent.
-Try again.

312
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,956
We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign ofthem.

313
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,759
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.

314
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,558
I'm looking at spending the rest of my life

315
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,358
being treated like a fool and a eunuch
by my own people.

316
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,150
Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do
to stop that from happening?

317
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,232
The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.

318
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,676
l'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

319
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,320
And once I've got them,

-Who, m'lord?

My lord, over here.

329
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,349
I think I've found what we're looking for.

330
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,711
Send the old man home.

331
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,518
Go back to Winterfell.

332
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,797
Take him back.

333
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,637
Theon, don't do this.

334
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,195
-You came back.
-As soon as I heard.

-I know.

00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,756
-She was a good...
-She's dead.

338
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,796
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

Doreah?

340
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,548
We can't find her.

341
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,432
She must be dead, too.

342
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,077
I led my people out ofthe Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

343
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,954
I should have been here.

344
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,792
You went to find me a ship.

00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,591
My place is by your side.

00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,830

with these people.

"These people"?

00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,431
And who is to be trusted?

350

Who are my people?

351
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,158
The Targaryens?

352

| only knew one, my brother,

353
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:28,309
and he would have let athousand men
rape me if it had got him the crown.

354
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,593
The Dothraki?

355
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,276
Most ofthem turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

356
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,111
Your people are in Westeros.

357
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,589
The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

358
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,557
-They will soon enough.
-And then what?

359
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:42,675
They'll pray for my return?

360
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,989
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

361
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,274
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

362
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,554
You are not your brother.

363
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,311
Trust me, Khaleesi.

364
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,473
There it is.

365
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,479
"Trust me."

366
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,715
And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?

367
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,193
Only you?

368
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,595
I don't need trust any longer.

369
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,029
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

370

-You are too young to be so...
-And you are too familiar.

without help. No one.

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,714

get back to your crows?

You don't know, do you?

00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,193
-Do you even know where they are?
-We're close.

381
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,989
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

382
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,990

talk about it without blushing,

bringing little princes and princesses
into the world,

the greatest honour for a queen.

441

Joffrey has always been difficult.

Robert was hunting.

00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,754
That was his custom.

Whenever my time was near,

449
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:58,354
my royal husband would flee to the trees
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

450
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,474
And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

451
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,558
and I would present him with a baby.

452
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:10,149
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

453
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:14,118
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives, and I had my brother.

he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,

456
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,917
and asked which one ofthem
proposed to keep him out.

with you on this very special day.

You'll do things forthem
that you know you shouldn't do.

You'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.

Love no one but your children.

On that front, a mother has no choice.

gotten a little largerthan she...

You did.

00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,957
Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he threw up.

484
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,475
He threw up on his horse on the way to
the tourney grounds. What was his name?

-Bryan.

You'd never squired for anyone before.

490

That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
"Let me, my lord. Let me."

You really remember?

495
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,314
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away. It's a rare talent.

Most of my squires,

497
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,552
they mean well, but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

505
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:27,834
the rake lines in the dirt along the list,

506
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,749
where the sun was in the sky when
you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,

507
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,592
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

508

l'll remember it all until I die.

And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

511
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,519
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.

what it had been like squiring foryou,

when l knewthat they could never have
the faintest idea what I was talking about.

521
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,431
I also had to replace someone's squire
on short notice.

522
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,028
Which knight was it?

523
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,949
Barristan Selmy.

524
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,993
The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
Before yourtime.

525
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,272
What was he like?

526
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,318
(SIGHS)

527
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,155
He was...

528
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,193
A painter.

529
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,308
A painter who only used red.

530
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:57,394
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,
not backthen.

531
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,433
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something that perfect.

532
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,750
I don't need to explain how that felt,
not to you.

533
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,673
It's hard to put into words.

534
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,953
It's like

535
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:15,677
stepping into a dream you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember,

536
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:17,590
and finding out that the dream

537
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,796
is more real than your life.

538
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,791
Leaving that battlefield was

539
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,870
like being dragged offto prison.

540
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:31,034
-Did you squire for him again?
-No.

541
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,548
I didn't have your gift.

542
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,193
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

543
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,032
l was awful, a complete liability.

544
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,874
Until one ofthe outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.

545
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,751
It's a good thing I am who I am.

546
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,316
I'd have been useless at anything else.

547
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,992
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.

548
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,479
Shocking, I know.

549
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,228
Some men are.

550
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,108
Ned Stark,

551
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,595
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

552
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,638
Not me, though.

553
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:22,675
My life has left me
uniquely unfit for constraint.

554
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,231
And have you thought about...

555
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,991
Of course. Every day.

556
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,319
And?

557
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,354
Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.

558
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,438
The Starks are very careful.

559
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,229
But there is a way, I think.

560
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,155
It wasn't possible until now.

561
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,475
What is it?

562
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,479
-|t's actually quite simple.
We”, let me help you.

563
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,869
You'll only have to do one thing.

564
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,758
Tell me.

565
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:05,111
You'll have to die.

566
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,514
(CHOKING)

567
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:41,958
(BONE CRACKING)

568
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,992
Jorah the Andal.

569
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:01,708
This man must sail past old Valyria.

570
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:06,074
All who travel too close to the doom
must have protection.

571
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,911
I didn't come here for lessons.

572
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,150
No, you came for the dragons.

573
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,795
You have them?

574
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,998
Where are they?

575
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,798
Draw your sword.

576
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,315
See what your steel is worth.

577
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:25,798
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

578
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,467
You love her.

579
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:38,758
Where are the dragons?

580
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,471
Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?

581
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,590
Will you betray her again?

582
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,793
Never.

583
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,992
The thief you seek

584
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,713
is with her now.

585
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,391
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

586
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,231
No one is calling you a thief.

587
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,032
Who is she to accuse us?

588
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,111
Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.

589
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,828
Begging us? It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

590
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,115
Without me, the dragons will die.

591
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,872
It will be forthe best.

592
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,750
Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

593
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,510
lfl knew where they were,
lwould not tell you.

594
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,192
PYAT PREE: You are cruel, my friend.

595
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,070
The Mother of Dragons is in the right.

596
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:41,989
She must be reunited with her babies.

597
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,918
-I will help you, Khaleesi.
-How?

598
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,873
I will take you to the House ofthe Undying
where l have put them.

599
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,311
You have my dragons?

600
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,156
When I learned you were coming to our city,
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.

601
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,588
(LAUGHING)

602
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,473
He procured them for me.

603
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,950
But there is no King of Qarth.

604
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,349
There is now.
That was the other half ofthe arrangement.

605
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,356
You would keep your gates and your minds
closed to everything outside your walls,

606
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,317
but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

607
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:25,109
I will open Qarth to the world
as l have forced it to open itselfto me.

608
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,790
Your ambition is an inspiration.

609
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,478
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

610
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:37,557
Three dragons the size of cats
and an alliance with a charlatan

611
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,470
do not make you a king.

612
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:41,830
An upstart and a charlatan?

613
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,191
Empires have been built by less.

614
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,555
Those on the margins
often come to control the centre,

615
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,234
and those in the centre make room for them,
willingly or otherwise.

616
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,519
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

617
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,591
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side,

618
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,473
forever.

619
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,834
-(GURGL|NG)
-(GASPS)

620
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:12,193
(GROANING)

621
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,318
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

622
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,830
A mother should be with her children.

623
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,315
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

624
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,078
Your dragons wait foryou
in the House ofthe Undying.

625
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,913
Come see them.

626
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,679
-Lady Stark!
-No farther.

627
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,632
Keep your hands off me, woman.

628
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,712
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

629
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,157
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

630
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,715
-CATELYN: What is it?
-They caught the Kingslayer.

631
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:08,147
(MEN SHOUTING)

632
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,629
Kingslayer!

633
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,711
-Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him!
-Hang him!

634
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,829
(MEN SHOUTING)

635
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,758
You'll die today.

636
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,558
Justice for the Karstark.

637
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:33,674
Gut him!

638
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:48,150
Get back! I want his head!

639
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:54,115
Any man who stands between a father
and his vengeance asks for death.

640
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,633
Lord Karstark,

641
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,711
this man is our prisoner.

642
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,993
This monster killed my son.

643
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,553
And crippled mine.

644
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,630
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.

645
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,949
lwill have his head.
And ifyou try and stop me...

646
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,392
You will strike me down?

647
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,231
Have you forgotten me, ser?

648
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:16,034
lam the widow of your liege,
Lord Eddard Stark.

649
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,348
lam the mother of your king!

650
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:19,669
-And where is our king now?
-You know very well.

651
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,871
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

652
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:25,269
Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.

653
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,160
-He brought that foreign bitch with him.
-How dare you!

654
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:31,118
-Threatening my lady is an act oftreason.
-Treason?

655
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,235
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

656
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,710
I understand your grief, my lord,
betterthan most, I understand it.

657
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:40,676
But in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

658
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,114
stand down.

659
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,635
When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.

660
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,075
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

661
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,468
Fathers who love their sons do.

662
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,877
I will have his head.

663
00:43:57,399 --> 00:44:00,277
Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
Lady Stark.

664
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,476
I would have come to your defence, but...

665
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,710
Take him to the stockades.

666
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,631
Bind him with every chain you can find!

667
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,676
You've become a real she-wolf
in your lateryears.

668
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,678
There's not much fish left in you.

669
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:12,112
And gag him!

670
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,788
Since when do you light your own candles?

671
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,635
Since I decided that I can't stand to look at
any of my handmaidens for another instant.

672
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,280
How manytimes
can you read one raven scroll?

673
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:35,595
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted
sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.

674
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:38,955
-More than we have.
-Yes, that's more than we have.

675
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,435
He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.

676
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:45,555
We have strong, high walls.

677
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,829
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

678
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,115
"Rain fire on them from above."
You're quoting Father, aren't you?

679
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:54,518
Why not?

680
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,272
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

681
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,953
Call it tactics, not strategy.

682
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,190
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

683
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:04,351
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.

684
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,558
It's just you, me and Joffrey,

685
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,516
the Lord ofthe Seven Kingdoms
and Protector ofthe Realm.

686
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,033
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

687
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,588
He needs to start acting like a king.

688
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:21,038
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

689
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,556
And ifthe entire city wants Joffrey dead...

690
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,869
I'm not the one
giving the boy whores to abuse.

691
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:28,073
I thought the girls might help him.

692
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,956
-Did you?
-l was wrong.

693
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,036
lfwe can't control him...

694
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,839
Do you think I haven't tried?

695
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:41,197
He doesn't listen to me.

696
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:48,635
It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.

697
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,590
| always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

698
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,473
He looks like him.

699
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,513
In a certain light.

700
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,759
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

701
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:12,158
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

702
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:16,791
Sometimes I wonder.

703
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:18,998
What?

704
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,912
lfthis is the price

705
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,713
forwhat we've done,

706
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,834
for our sins.

707
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,629
Sins?

708
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:30,907
The Targaryens...

709
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:33,559
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years, I know.

710
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,510
That's what Jaime and I would say
to each other in our moments of doubt.

711
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,955
It's what I told Ned Stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.

712
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:47,959
Halfthe Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

713
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:49,558
What's the saying?

714
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:52,631
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin."

715
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,115
You've beaten the odds.

716
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,515
Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children, both ofthem.

717
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,114
(SOBS)

718
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,989
MAN 1: Then why wait?
MAN 2: We're sworn to the king.

719
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,310
-There's not a king.
-That's treason.

720
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:34,310
MAN 1: So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

721
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,151
-Back off, you.
-No, lwon't.

722
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,675
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

723
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:41,147
So they say.

724
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:42,911
BRlENNE: The Kingslayerwon't last the night.

725
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:46,475
The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.

726
00:47:47,399 --> 00:47:49,469
And when the Karstarks draw their swords...

727
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:52,634
Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

728
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,308
Come.

729
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,910
MAN: He'll not be making it through the night.

730
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,837
I need to be alone with him.

731
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:16,514
-My lady, our orders...
-Your orders, which ljust gave you,

732
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,795
are to leave me alone with him.

733
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,757
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

734
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,274
I believe it's my last night in this world.

735
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:31,794
Is that awoman?

736
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:34,110
Do you hear them out there?

737
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,319
They want your head.

738
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,718
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

739
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,519
You strangled his son with your chains.

740
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,273
Oh. Oh.

741
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,393
Was he the one on guard duty?

742
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:51,557
He was in my way.

743
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,559
-Any knight would have done the same.
-You are no knight.

744
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:57,834
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

745
00:48:57,919 --> 00:48:59,352
So many vows.

746
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,271
They make you swear and swear.

747
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,438
Defend the king, obeythe king,
obey your father,

748
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,308
protect the innocent, defend the weak.

749
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,559
But what ifyour father despises the king?

750
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:15,517
What ifthe king massacres the innocent?

751
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:17,553
It's too much.

752
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,551
No matterwhat you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

753
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,069
Where did you find this beast?

754
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,068
She is a truer knight than you will ever be,

755
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:31,634
-Kings|ayer.
-Kings|ayer.

756
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,078
What a king he was.

757
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,636
Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the Second of His Name,

758
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,632
Lord ofthe Seven Kingdoms,
Protector ofthe Realm,

759
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:44,753
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

760
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,075
You are a man without honour.

761
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,509
Do you know,

762
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,829
I've never been with any woman but Cersei.

763
00:49:56,439 --> 00:49:57,997
So in my own way,

764
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,598
l have more honourthan

765
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:03,950
poor old dead Ned.

766
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,836
What was the name of
that bastard he fathered?

767
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,876
-Brienne.
-No, that wasn't it.

768
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,478
Snow, a bastard from the North.

769
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,359
Now, when... When good old Ned
came home with some whore's baby,

770
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,998
did you pretend to love it?

771
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,153
No.

772
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,316
You're not very good at pretending.

773
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,277
You're an honest woman.

774
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,355
You hated that boy, didn't you?

775
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:36,190
How could you not hate him?

776
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:38,549
The walking, talking reminder

777
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,196
that the honourable Lord Eddard Stark

778
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,118
fucked anotherwoman.

779
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,395

(SIGHS)

781
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,912
I told you what would happen.

782
00:50:57,279 --> 00:50:58,712
All ofyou.

783
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:03,157
I told you what would happen
ifyou served me loyally.

784
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,631
And what would happen ifyou did not.

785
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,634
What are you doing? What have you done?

786
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:13,394
lfthere are any who still question
whether your new lord means what he says,

787
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,072
here is the answer to your question.
