00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,354
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

185
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,431
Where are you taking me?

186
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,352
I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.

187
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,557
She's waiting for us at the Eyrie.

188
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,358
You'll be safe there.

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,319
Did you kill Joffrey?

190
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:03,111
Did I kill Joffrey?

191
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,598
I've been in the Vale for weeks.

192
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,829
I know it was you.

193
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,353
And who helped me with this conspiracy?

194
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,357
There was Ser Dontos.

195
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,317
You used him to get me
out of King's Landing,

196
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,959
but you would nevertrust him to kill the King.

197
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,468
Why not?

198
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,117
Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

199
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,759
Then perhaps it was your husband.

200
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,879
No.

201
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,190
How do you know?

202
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,712
| just do.

203
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,910
You're right.
He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.

204
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,035
But you were.

205
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,631
Do you remember
that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?

206
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,072
I don't suppose you noticed
that a stone was missing after the feast.

207
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,268
The poison.

208
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,074
I don't understand.

209
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,594
The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.

210
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,352
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.

211
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,508
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

212
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,991
Always keep your foes confused.

213
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,549
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

214
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,631
they can't know what you plan to do next.

215
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,758
I don't believe you.

216
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,836
lfthey catch you, they'll put your head

217
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,757
on a spikejust like my father's.

218
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,798
You'd risk that just to confuse them?

219
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,714
So many men, they risk so little.

220
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,789
They spend their lives avoiding danger.

221
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,999
And then they die.

222
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,717
l'd risk everything to get what I want.

223
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,874
And what do you want?

224
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,074
Everything.

225
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,350
My friendship
with the Lannisters was productive.

226
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,788
But Joffrey,

227
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,278
a vicious boy with a crown on his head,
is not a reliable ally.

228
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,478
And who could trust a friend like that?

229
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,677
Who could trust you?

230
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,270
I don't want friends like me.

231
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,554
My new friends are predictable.

232
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,078
Very reasonable people.

233
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,149
As for what happened to Joffrey,

234
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,870
that was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

235
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,310
Nothing like athoughtful gift

236
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,510
to make a new friendship grow strong.

237
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,912
MARGAERY: I can't believe you're going.

238
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:29,559
Leaving me alone here with these people.

239
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,550
OLENNA: The time has come, my dear.

240
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:34,358
There's nothing more tedious than atrial.

241
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,715
Except perhaps these gardens.

242
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,191
lfl have to take one more leisurely stroll
through these gardens,

243
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,588
l'll fling myself from the cliffs.

244

(MARGAERY LAUGHS)

245
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:45,557
OLENNA: Have you been to see Tommen yet?

246
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,629
No.

247
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,469
Have they even agreed to the match?
No one tells me anything.

248
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,314
I wasn't originally meant to
marry your grandfather Luthor.

249
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,313
He was engaged to my sister,
your great-aunt Viola.

250
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,033
l was to be given to some Targaryen or other.

251
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,834
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

252
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,478
But the moment I saw my intended,

253
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,238
with his twitchy little ferret's face

254
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,357
and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.

255
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:21,472
So the evening
before Luthor was to propose to my sister,

256
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,232
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

257
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,595
and happened upon his chamber.

258
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,788
(LAUGHS)

259
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,153
How absentminded of me.

260
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,718
Mmm-hmm.

261
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,997
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

262
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,355
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

263
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,870
And once he could, the only thing he wanted

264
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,116
was what I'd given him the night before.

265
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,108
lwas good.

266
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,515
lwas very good.

267
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,954
You are even better.

268
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,747
But you need to act quickly.

269
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,637
Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid.

270
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,597
She'll turn the boy against you
as soon as she can.

271
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,637
And by the time you're married,
it'll be too late.

272
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,152
Luckily for you, the Queen Regent

273
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,713

Mourning her dear departed boy.

275
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:12,508
Accusing her brother of his murder,
which he didn't commit.

276
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:13,994
He could have done.

277
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,797
But he didn't.

278
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:17,232
You don't know, Grandmother.

279
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,678
But I do know.

280

You don't think
I'd let you marrythat beast, do you?

281

brought you back to the capital.

Why did she set you free?

370

You know why. She'd hoped
l'd send her daughters back to her.

that if her daughters were alive,
l'd return them to her.

374
