00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,589
MAN 1: Riders approaching!
MAN 2: Open the gate!

2
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,589
-YARA: Why, it's the Prince ofWinterfeII.
-(MEN LAUGHING)

3
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,074
-Envy isn't attractive.
-What envy?

4
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,035
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

5
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:40,508
I took the great castle ofWinterfeII
with 20 men.

6
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,317
You're a great warrior.

7
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,834
I saw the bodies above your gates.

8
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,993
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

9
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,797
(MEN LAUGHING)

10
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,270
I treated the Stark boys with honour,
and they repaid me with treachery.

11
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:57,396
You treated them with honour?
By butchering them?

12
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,674
Before I had to kill them,

13
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,432
-I treated them...
-You seized their home, as is your right.

14
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,157
We're ironborn, we take what we need.

15
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,275
Exactly.

16
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,271
Then you made them prisoners in their home
and they ran away.

17
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,951
Is that treachery?

18
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,198
I'd call it bravery.

19
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,596
-They made me a promise...
-Your little boy prisoners made you a promise

20
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,194
and you got mad when they broke it?

21
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,793
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

22
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,437
-Don't call me...
-A cunt.

23
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,235
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

24
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,671
You know how valuable those boys were?

25
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,479
lfl hadn't killed them,
the Northerners would think me weak.

26
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,232
You are weak. And you're stupid.

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,673
l'm warning you.

28
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,434
Go on, then. Warn me.

29
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,836
You haven't brought enough men.

30
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,036
How am I supposed to
defend Winterfell with just this lot?

31
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,348
You're not.

32
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,112
I've come to bring you home.
Fatherwants aword.

33
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,792
Is this ajoke?

34
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,198
Winterfell is the heart ofthe North.

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,078
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

36
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,911
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?

37
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,672
Our power comes from our ships.

38
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,070
And now that you've decorated your walls
with the bodies ofthe Stark boys,

39
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,231
every man in the North wants
to see you hanged.

40
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,589
-When Robb Stark finds out...
-He won't find out.

41
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,159
We've killed all the ravens.

42
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,117
We have all the horses.

43
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,237
I've taken Winterfell.

44
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,388
And I will keep Winterfell.

45
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,231
Leave us.

46
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,750
Theon, you're my blood.

47
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,440
We both loved our mother.

48
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,159
We both endured our father.

49
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,389
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

50
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,356
I don't intend to die.

51
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,595
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

52
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,078
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

53
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,875
And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,

54
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,075
screaming like a dying pig.

55
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,229
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

56
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,355
lwanted to strangle you.

57
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,676
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

58
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,431
You smiled at me.

59
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,951
Don't die so far from the sea.

60
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,433
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,592
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

62
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,750
Mance will want to question this one.

63
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,149
Knows all about where the crows are
and what they're planning.

64
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,788
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

65
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,029
Gut him.

66
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,680
He could have killed me halfa dozen times.

67
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,987
And now he wishes he did.

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,639
Gut him.

69
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,951
He's a bastard ofWinterfell, Ned Stark's son.

70
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,152
Mance willwant him.

71
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,475
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

72
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,754
I don't know.

73
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,828
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

74
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,235
He runs, l'll chop his balls off.

75
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,835
He runs, I'll do it meself.

76
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,429
We're even now, Jon Snow.

77
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,473
(BREATHING HEAVlLY)

78
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,958
I couldn't do it.

79
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,032
I had the sword on her neck, ljust couldn't...

80
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,268
I know.

81
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,519
The others?

82
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,272
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

83
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,714
We found your tracks fast enough.

84
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,359
But they found us before we found you.

85
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,588
They died because of me.

86
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,919
See that it wasn't for nothing.

87
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,068
MAN: All right, up, lad.

88
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,277
Come on, on your feet, now.

89
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,588
Move it.

90
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:33,197
Is she beautiful?

91
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,878
I've never met her.

92
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,913
What's her name?

93
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,957
Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.

94
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,630
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,354
(LAUGHING)

96
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,837
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

97
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,592
-An important bridge.
-Ah.

98
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,667
It was before they killed my father.

99
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,954
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

100
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,395
but only ifl crossed that bridge.

101
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,947
When I speak to people from the North,

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,156
they all loved your father.

103
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,588
He was the best man I ever met.

104
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,194
I know children always thinkthat
about their fathers, but...

105
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,192
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

106
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,515
He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father,

107
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,957
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all ofthem.

108
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,837
The farmers ploughing the fields
are yours to protect.

109
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,877
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

110
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,473
The soldiers you order into battle.

111
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,430
He told me he woke with fear in the morning
and went to bed with fear in the night.

112
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,358
I didn't believe him.

113
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,510
| asked him,
"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

114
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,474
"That is the only time a man can be brave,"
he told me.

115
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,396
lwish I could have met him.

116
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,316
He would have liked you.

117
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,153
Most lords worry more about their gold
and their glory

118
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,911
than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

119
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:13,230
-He didn't care much about gold or glory.
-And you?

120
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,514
You think I'm fighting this war
so they'll sing songs about me?

121
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,558
lwant to go home.

122
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,830
-I want the men following me to go home.
-Then why don't you?

123
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,595
Because we'll never be safe
until the Lannisters are defeated.

124
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,671
And because I believe in justice.

125
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,956
-Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
-That would be a start.

126
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,559
(HORSE NEIGHING)

127
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,197
Your Grace, milady.

128
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,514
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

129
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,313
How?

130
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,193
How?

131
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,352
Tell me this isn't true.

132
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,189

Forthe girls.

134
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,554
-You betrayed me.
-Robb...

135
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,754
No!

136
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,431
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

137
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,788
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.

138
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,791
Sansa and Arya are
captives in King's Landing.

139
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,347
l have five children,
and only one ofthem is free.

140
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:27,148
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.

141
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:30,675
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

142
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,358
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

143
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,510
I would carve out my heart
and offer it to the Father,

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,832
if he would let my sons wake
from their graves and step into a prison cell.

145
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,275
-| grieve for your sons, my lord.
-I don't want your grief.

146
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,315
lwant my vengeance.

147
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,549
And you stole it from me.

148
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:55,794
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life foryour children,

149
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,394
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

150
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,589
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.

151
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,835
You've weakened our position.

152
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,433
You've brought discord into our camp.

153
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,909
And you did it all behind my back.

154
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,513
-Make sure she's guarded day and night.
-Robb.

155

in pursuit ofthe Kingslayer?

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,991

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,911
I didn't mean to give offence, my lady.
Forgive me.

177
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:33,433
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

178
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,954
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?

179
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,510
You've harmed others,
those you were sworn to protect,

180
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,832
the weak, the innocent.

181
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,878
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

182
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,394
You will not provoke me to anger.

183
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,994
I already have. Look at you.

184
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,513
You're ready to chop my head off.

185
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,352
Do you think you could?

186
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,077
Do you think you could beat me
in afairfight?

187
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,957
I've never seen you fight.

188
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,677
The answer is no.

189
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,072
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

190
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,639
You're not one ofthem.

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,958
All my life men like you have sneered at me.

192
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,793
And all my life I've been
knocking men like you into the dust.

193
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,837
lfyou're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.

194
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,474
Do you take me for an idiot? In!

195
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,596
I took you for a fighter, a man...

196
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,147
Pardon. Woman of honour.

197
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,957
Was I wrong?

198
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,553
You're afraid.

199
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,237
Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

200
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,828
KEVAN: King's Landing will fall
an hour after Stannis lands his force.

201
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,069
It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.

202
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,278
Surrender the Iron Throne?

203
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:03,431
Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.

204
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,991
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.

205
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,435
He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.

206
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:17,271
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

207
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:21,238
The scouts assure us
Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.

208
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,913
Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
of Stark's movement,

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,433
he lured us into atrap.

210
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,759
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

211
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,997
Too close to Casterly Rock.

212
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,756
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

213
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,352
The Greyjoys have done us a great favour.

214
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:47,038
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.

215
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,235
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.

216
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,950
He'll risk anything at anytime

217
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,150
because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

218
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,558
We'll ride at nightfall.

219
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,473
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

220
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,348
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

221
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,158
Track down this brotherhood
and destroythem.

222
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,558
The girl has proven herself a good servant.

223
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,790
She'll stay on with you.

224
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,756
See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.

225
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,797
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

226
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,193
GUARD: You've got some
questions to answer.

227
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,077
Who killed SerAmory?

228
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,549
MAN: I don't know! Please!
GUARD: Give me the name.

229
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,427
GUARD: Take this one out for the crows.
MAN: I told you, I don't know.

230
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:49,593
Please.

231
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,914
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.

232
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,672
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

233
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,238
Where's Jaqen?

234
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,753
Don't care.

235
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,710
Where's your stick now, bitch?

236
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,357
I promised to fuck you with it.

237
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,954
GUARD: Come on, time to kill some wolves.

238
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,031
You need sour cherries to make it right.

239
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,078
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

240
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,271
That's where the real flavour is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

241
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,429
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

242
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,919
Where's Jaqen?

243
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,717
-How would I know?
-I need him now.

244
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,828
-Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
-You need him?

245
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,548
He's helping me.

246
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,631
-HOT PIE: I saw him.
-Where?

247
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,391
-Where? Where?
-Ow!

248
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,630
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

249
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:43,788
On patrol.

250
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,918
Let go of my ears.

251
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,193
(HORSE NEIGHING)

252
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,397
What do you want with him anyway?

253
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,391
QHORIN: Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

254
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:13,552
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

255
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:15,630
-They'|l nevertrust me.
-They might.

256
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,437
-|fyou do what needs to be done.
-What?

257
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,033
(SHOUTING) How does it feel
knowing those men all died

258
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,077
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

259
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,717
-I didn't.
-I should have known better,

260
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,711
trusting a traitor's bastard.

261
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,473
He's not yours to kill, crow.

262
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:56,754
Do you have to do that here?

263
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:00,869
I like to keep me hands clean.

264
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,068
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

265
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,314
You should start wearing the gold cloak.

266
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,753
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

267
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,830
You're commander of the City Watch.

268
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,276
-You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
-A cloak slows you down in a fight.

269
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,429
Makes it hard to move quietly.

270
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,068
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

271
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,231
Well, you're not
sneaking through alleyways any longer.

272
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,469
You're supposed to stand out.

273
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,517
We had a deal
and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

274
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,157
Fine, fine.

275
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,671
No gold cloak.

276
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,108
What?

277
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,834
-What?
-What? What?

278
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,193
Why are you staring at me?

279
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,516
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

280
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,592
Why am I here?

281
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,750
To help me plan
the defence of King's Landing.

282
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,828
(LAUGHS)

283
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,036
-Stannis will be here any day.
-(S|GHS)

284
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,152
And one ofthese explains how to beat him?

Chevalteesh.

289
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,877
l'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

290
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,870
My Lord Hand. Commander.

291
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:30,235
I must compliment you
on the gold cloaks' performance

292
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,389
these last few weeks.

293
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,555
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

294
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,071
I did not know.

295
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:41,348
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

296
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,436
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

297
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:47,278
For questioning?

298
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,474
No.

299
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,836
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

300
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,752
-We talked about this.
-Aye, we talked about it.

301
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,797
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

302
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,268
Maybe this part's not in your books.

303
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,113
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.

304
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,750
Food's worth more than gold.

305
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,354
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

306
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,557
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

307
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,634
The thieves, they love a siege.

308
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,517
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

309
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,148
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

310
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:27,510
Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

311
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,595
Ah.

312
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,713
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

313
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,756
Thrilling subject.

314
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,798
Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

315
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,270
Stannis knows King's Landing.

316
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,554
He knows where the walls are strongest,

317
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,756
and he knows which gates are weakest.

318
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,158
The Mud Gate.

319
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,351
A good ram will batter it down in minutes,

320
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,675
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

321
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,477
That's where he'll land.

322
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,153
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,

323
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,958
what is our plan?

324
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,551
We could throw books at his men.

325
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,959
We don't have that many books.

326
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,438
We don't have that many men, either.

327
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,476
What do we have?

328
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,273
Pig shit.

329
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,228
(BREATHING HEAVlLY)

00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,956

doing something much worse.

at the end ofthe world.

333
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,516
I can't imagine anything much worse.

334
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:50,310
You lack imagination.

335
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,596
Where do you think Jon is right now?

336
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,353
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

337
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,317
A betting man would go with dead.

338
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,312
He's not dead.

339
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,356
No, Jon's a great fighter.

340
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:07,478
Well, he's betterthan me
and a lot better than you.

341
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,550
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

342
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,794
So did his father.

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,958
It's them in the middle that last a long time.

347
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,198
(METAL CLANGS)

348
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,950
What in seven hells is that?

349
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,229
The First Men made these marks.

350
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,912
Help me with it.

351
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,312
(GRUNTS)

352
00:23:02,999 --> 00:23:04,512
Look.

353
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,354
lfyou find something you're not supposed to,

354
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:13,590
best thing to do
is pretend you've never seen it.

355
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,590
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

356
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,272
It's been here a long time.

357
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,788
Oh.

358
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,312
Must be dragonglass.

359
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:26,718
GRENN: Dragonglass?

360
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,276
The maesters call it obsidian.

361
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,668
Why would a brother hide it here?

362
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,431
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

363
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,677
Mind where you're going.

364
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,512
I'm sorry. I'll...

365
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,352
Where were you?

366
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,634
A man has patrol duty.

367
00:23:57,719 --> 00:24:00,392
Tywin Lannister was right here,
and now he's gone.

368
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:02,356
A girl owes one more name.

369
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,351
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

370
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,708
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

371
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,518
A minute, an hour, a month.

372
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,519
Death is certain,

373
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,158
the time is not.

374
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,389
He's taking his army to attack my brother.

375
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,390
I need him dead right now.

376
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,758
This a man cannot do.

377
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,472
You promised you'd help me.

378
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,432
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

379
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,556
There must be others. Give a name, any name.

380
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,357
And you'll kill them?

381
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,354
Anybody?

382
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,239
By the Seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

383
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,799
I swear it.

384
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,033
All right.

385
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,071
Jaqen H'ghar.

386
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,237
A girl gives a man his own name?

387
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,835
-That's right.
-Gods are not mocked.

388
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,314
-This is nojoking thing.
-|'m notjoking.

389
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,753
A man can go kill himself.

390
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,192
Un-name me.

391
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,599
-No.
-P|ease?

392
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,228
I'll un-name you.

393
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,911
-Thank you.
-|fyou help me and my friends escape.

394
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,679
This would require more than one life.

395
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,672
-This is not part of our bargain.
-Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

396
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,554
A girl lacks honour.

397
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,279
lfl do this thing, a girl must obey.

398
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,032
Agirl will obey.

399
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,754
A girl and her friends will
walk through the gate at midnight.

400
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,558
Thank you, Podrick.

401
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,519
Odd little boy.

402
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,911
l have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

403
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,272
You and Varys both.

404
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,270
Excellent lamprey pie.

405
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,271
Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?

406
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:16,471
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

407
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,791
An inspiration for the troops.

408
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,471
The young king in his shining armour

409
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:23,107
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

410
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,952
He's only a boy.

411
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,679
Younger boys are off fighting his war.

412
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:30,673
-He's not ready.
-What is he, 17?

413
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,907
-Remember Jaime at 17?
-Betterthan you.

414
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,868
Some men have a gift for this sort ofthing,

415
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,711
some don't.

416
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,471
His place is not on the battlefield.

417
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:42,595
It's not on the throne, either,

418
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,352
sadly for all of us.

419
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:49,478
Do you think I'm an idiot?

420
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,710
No, I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.

421
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,109
You shipped off my only daughter.

422
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,078
And now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

423
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,435
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.

424
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,272
He has the finest armour gold can buy.

425
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,917
He needs to be out there.

426
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:07,435
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

427
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,908
instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

428
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,232
Any dessert?

429
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,672
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

430
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,910
Because he has
thousands of spies in his employ.

431
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:21,672
Because he knows everything we do
before we do it.

432
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,078
Because he doesn't have a cock.

433
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,318
Neither do you.

434
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,313
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

435
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:33,278
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

436
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,989
That little worm between your legs
does halfyourthinking.

437
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,671
-|t's not that little.
-(LAUGHS)

438
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,594
Why are you smiling?

439
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,599
Because I'm happy.

440
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,551
And why are you happy?

441
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,949
Because I have your little whore.

442
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,798
I thought you preferred blondes.

443
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,552
Such a droll little fellow.

444
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,312
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

445
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,269
No?

446
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,994
Good. Fatherwill be so pleased.

447
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,035
Why do you care who I fuck?

448
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,587
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

449
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,079
You stole my only daughter,

450
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,758
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

451
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,632
This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.

452
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,947
-You need me.
-Forwhat?

453
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,792
Your skill in battle?

454
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,670
Pretty thing, your whore.

455
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,952
Lovely body.

456
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:32,629
The bruises will heal in time.

457
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,752
Where did you find her?

458
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,989
Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.

459
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,789
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

460
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,353
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

461
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,829
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

462
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,352
Oh?

463
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,594
Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

464
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,512
You don't buythem,

465
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,351
you only rent them.

466
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,998
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.

467
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:02,397
This one you like.

468
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:05,230
You like hervery much.

469
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,394
Could it be love?

470
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,154
Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.

471
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,672
Unless Joffrey is hurt.

472
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,911
And then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer, too.

473
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,878
And if he dies,

474
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:23,554
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.

475
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,630
And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?

476
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,868
Would you like to see her?

477
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,517
I thought you might.

478
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:35,352
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

479
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,589
(DOOR OPENING)

480
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,351
I'm sorry they hurt you.

481
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,437
You must be brave.

482
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,835
I promise I will free you.

483
00:30:20,879 --> 00:30:21,994
Don't forget me.

484
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,795
Never.

485
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,158

(DOOR CLOSING)

487
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,635
lwill hurt you forthis.

488
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,549
A day will come
when you think you're safe and happy,

489
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,996
and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth.

490
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,957
And you will know the debt is paid.

491
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,755
Get out.

492
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,349
Shae!

493
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,476
I've been waiting all night.

494
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,067
What is wrong?

495
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,989
You're beautiful.

496
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,791
Then why do you look sad?

497
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,153
We have to be more careful.

498
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:39,037
Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

499
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,517
There are people who want to hurt me.

500
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,476
I know. I won't let them.

501
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,148
I'll cut offtheir faces. I will.

502
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:54,028
lwould kill foryou. Do you knowthat?

503
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:58,598
I expect I'll have to before this is over.

504
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,679
You're mine.

505
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,832
I'm yours.

506
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,359
Promise me.

507
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:14,109
I'm yours, and you are mine.

508
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:27,511
ROBB: Still no word?

509
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,996
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.

510
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,717
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.

511
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,756
-Once he captures the castle...
-Theon has my brothers.

512
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,388
-|fwe storm the castle...
-He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

513
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:46,348
They're his only hope
of escaping the North with his head.

514
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,556
Send word to your son.

515
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,271
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.

516
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,712
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
Too much...

517
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,315
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

518
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,315
He betrayed our cause.

519
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,949
He betrayed me.

520
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,634
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

521
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:13,797
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

522
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,434
Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.

523
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,872
My lady.

524
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,993
How are you?

525
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,077
How am I?

526
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,230
I've had to arrest my mother.

527
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,311
The Lannisters have my sisters.

528
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,959
The man I considered my closest friend

529
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,156
has seized my home and my brothers.

530
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:48,912
I'm fighting awar and I don't know
if! should march south or north.

531
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:52,150
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

532
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,558
No.

533
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:54,958
Forgive me.

534
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,748
You're being kind.

535
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,834
-l have no right.
-You have every right.

536
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,193
You're a king.

537
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,271
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

538
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,797
What kind do you want to be?

539
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,073
I don't know.

540
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,513
The good kind.

541
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,951
They spend their whole lives
preparing forthe crown.

542
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,554
l was raised to be Lord ofWinterfell.

543
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,994
l was raised to be a proper little lady,

544
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,995
to play the harp and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.

545
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,353
I'd like to hear you playthe harp.

546
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:32,395
-No. No, you would not.
-(CHUCKLES)

547
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,436
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry

548
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,190
to sawing off men's feet?

549
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,916
When I was 12,

550
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,514
my mother and father went to a wedding.

551
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,637
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.

552
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:03,313
And they left me with my little brother.

553
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,311
The second afternoon they were gone
was the hottest day in the three-year summer.

554
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,868
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

555
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:16,110
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

556
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,476
The rich, the poor, we were all there.

557
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:22,790
Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

558
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,151
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

559
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,557
l was treading water,

560
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,396
talking to a friend,

561
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,472
when I realised I hadn't seen my brother.

562
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,996
I called his name.

563
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,593
Then I started screaming his name.

564
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:46,832
And then I saw him...

565
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,711
floating face down.

566
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,033
My heart just...stopped.

567
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,438
lwas...

568
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:01,709
I dragged him from the water.

569
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,556
My friend helped me, lthink.

570
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,516
I don't even remember.

571
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,678
He was so little.

572
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,634
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.

573
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,390
And I screamed at him and I shook him.

574
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,632
And he was dead.

575
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:25,678
Just dead.

576
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:31,077
A man ran over.

577
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,868
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

578
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,676
In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.

579
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:42,956
So you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

580
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,953
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

581
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,348
And he pushed me out ofthe way.

582
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,836
You have to understand,
for a slave to push a highborn girl,

583
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,911
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

584
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,510
But he pushed me out ofthe way,

585
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:05,718
and he started pressing on my brother's chest

586
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,156
again and again and again,

587
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,116
until my brother spat out

588
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,589
half ofthe Rhoyne and cried out.

589
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:20,149
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

590
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,669
I decided two things that day.

591
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,993
I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

592
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,395
And when I came of age,

593
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:41,638
I would never live in a slave city again.

594
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,473
(SIGHS)

595
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,038
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

596
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,271
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

597
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,033
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

598
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,748
I don't want you to marry her.

599
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,670
But you needed that bridge.

600
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,155
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

601
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,468
(CHUCKLES)

602
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,512
(MOANING)

603
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,795
HOT PIE: The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

604
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,949
GENDRY: Shut up.

605
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,713
HOT PIE: Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.

606
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:23,147
The nice, warm oven.

607
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,275
Shut up. What did you bring?

608
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,990
The cheese could be better.

609
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,513
I did get some nice sausages.

610
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,989
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

611
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,559
He didn't say.

612
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,197
He just said, "Walk through the gates."

613
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:36,394
What about the guards?

614
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:38,231
He didn't say anything about the guards.

615
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,878
What, he left that bit out?

616
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,439
It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

617
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:43,518
We have to trust him.

618
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,635
Trust him?

619
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,678
You trusted him to fight with us
when you set him free and he ran.

620
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:49,670
-I want to go back to the kitchens.
-Shut up.

621
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,950
Stay here ifyou're afraid.

622
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,158
HOT PIE: Arry, don't.

623
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,870
Away!

624
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,153
Reset!

625
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,071
lfthe wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

626
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,433
Will it hold?

627
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,678
Can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.

628
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:44,031
MAN: Again, pull!

629
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:49,589
I admire you, Ser Davos.

630
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,796
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.

631
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,668
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
and thinkthey insult you.

632
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,910
So you take the onion for your sigil,

633
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,308
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

634
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,276
My son wishes me to change it.

635
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,510
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

636
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,388
I understand why
the older families look down at me.

637
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:12,310
Do you? Why?

638
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:15,277
-My fatherwas a crabber.
-And?

639
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,193
Well, sons of lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

640
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,679
Our hands stink.

641
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,035
And where were those lords
when Storm's End starved?

642
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,430
Many fought bravely for your brother.

643
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:27,987
Many fought for the Mad King.

644
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,356
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

645
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,991
Some are happy to do it to my face.

646
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,876
We were forgotten.

647
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,549
Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.

648
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,552
The glorious rebels
marching from battle to battle,

649
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,755
liberating towns
from the yoke ofthe Mad King,

650
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,035
while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

651
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,429
-No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
-No? Robert did.

652
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:52,636
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

653
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,075
-He was only a boy.
-Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

654
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,196
First, we ate the horses.

655
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:04,669
We weren't riding anywhere,
not with the castle surrounded.

656
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,750
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

657
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,956
Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.

658
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,677
I do like dogs.

659
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:15,195
Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
Then the rats.

660
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,197
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

661
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:21,429
She couldn't speak any more, she was so frail.

662
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,789
And then you made it through the lines.

663
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,031
Slipped right through
in your little black sailboat with your onions.

664
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:30,758
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

665
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,990
Every man in Storm's End wanted
to kiss you that night.

666
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,230
l was relieved they did not.

667
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,597
Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.

668
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:44,917
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,
so I gave it up.

669
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,594
Insult or no, I gave it up.

670
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,431
Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king

671
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:51,555
and I've always done my duty.

672
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,675
But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

673
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,273
Your Grace,

674
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,471
I pray I serve you well.

675
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:10,148
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
to wearthe badge.

676
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,356
You're the Master ofWhisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

677
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:21,237
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

678
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:24,038
l have many little birds in the North, my lord,

679
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,352
but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

680
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,068
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

681
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,717
To strike?

682
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:37,235
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

683
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,756
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

684
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:42,989
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores
of King's Landing,

685
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,832
I'll ride out to greet him.

686
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:46,671
A brave choice, Your Grace.

687
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:49,353
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

688
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:52,597
They say Stannis never smiles.

689
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,989
I'll give him a red smile

690
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,672
from ear to ear.

691
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,389
Imagine Stannis' terror.

692
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:05,832
lam trying.

693
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:08,792
You're an intelligent man.

694
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,472
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

695
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,189
Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

696
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,079
lwish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

697
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,638
lwish we could, too.

698
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,678
What do you want?

699
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,359
Tell me.

700
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,396
lfwe're going to play, you'll have to start.

701
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,390
My brotherwas
the youngest Kingsguard in history.

702
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,313
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

703
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,078
When I reached manhood,

704
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,708
my father put me in charge of all the drains
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

705
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,876
A most highborn plumber.

706
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,836
The water never flowed better.

707
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:54,592
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

708
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,560
I never expected to have any real power.

709
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:59,470
So when my father named me acting Hand...

710
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:01,390
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

711
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:04,438
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.

712
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,396
Honourable men.

713
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,199
But they disdained the game
and those who played.

714
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:11,395
-You enjoythe game.
-I do.

715
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:13,998
Last thing I expected.

716
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,308
And you play it well.

717
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:17,469
I'd like to keep playing it.

718
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:22,837
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

719
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:26,707
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honourthe Lord of Light.

720
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,432
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,

721
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,033
the Drowned God wants them drowned.

722
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,838
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?

723
00:45:34,959 --> 00:45:37,427
Where is the god oftits and wine?

724
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,038
In the Summer Isles,
they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

725
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,874
We should sail there immediately.

726
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,987
This morning, I heard a song

727
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,712
all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

728
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,673
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

729
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:59,431
A girl at the edge ofthe world
is the least of our problems.

730
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,317
She has three dragons.

731
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,236
But even ifwhat they say is true,

732
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,118
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

733
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:11,273
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

734
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,912
One game at a time, my friend.

735
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,951
JORAH: Careful, Khaleesi.

736
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,272
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have a thousand eyes watching for you.

737
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,118
I found one.

738
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:36,069
A ship with a good captain.

739
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,797
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

740
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,154
Astapor?

741
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:40,433
We cannot stay here.

742
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,512
They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.

743
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,477
They're not your children.

744
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:49,192
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons
and I know you love them,

745
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,759
but you didn't growthem in yourwomb.

746
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,149
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

747
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:55,595
And ifwe stay in Qarth, we'll die.

748
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,149
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

749
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,394
You know I would die foryou.

750
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,629
lwill never abandon you.

751
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:08,596
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

752
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:10,670
Then serve me.

753
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,150
If my dragons are in
the House ofthe Undying, then take me there.

754
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,991
That's what the warlock wants.

755
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,672
He told you so himself.

756
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,432
lfyou enterthat place,
you will never leave again.

757
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,353
-His magic is strong.
-And what of my magic?

758
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:26,351
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

759
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:29,476
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

760
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:34,072
Until my last breath, lwill remember.

761
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,678
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

762
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:44,991
They are my children.

763
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:49,309
And they are the only children I will ever have.

764
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,873
Take me to them.

765
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,350
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

766
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:17,554
lfthey haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

767
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:20,118
As you say.

768
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:23,236
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot awhile longer.

769
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,958
-What's this?
-Gold forthe farmer.

770
00:48:27,439 --> 00:48:28,997
For his trouble.

771
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,915
His troubles are done.

772
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:34,269
He's feeding the crops now.

773
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,953
His wife, too.

774
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:40,997
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

775
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:02,317
OSHA: Got as far
as the farm and then doubled back.

776
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:07,716
Walked through the stream
to throw offthe hounds.

777
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,069
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd thinkto look.

778
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,558
LUWIN: You're right

779
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:18,038
so far.

780
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,677
OSHA: Who was that
out there hung up at the gates?

781
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,868
Must have been the farmer's boys.

782
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,229
OSHA: He killed them and burned them

783
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,399
and passed them off as the little lords?

784
00:49:35,759 --> 00:49:37,351
LUWIN: They mustn't know.

785
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,035
Bran would blame himself.

786
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,917
OSHA: They'll never hear it from me.

787
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,033
The little lads have suffered enough.
