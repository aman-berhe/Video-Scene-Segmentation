He also named a 6-year-old boy High Septon

107
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,752
because he thought
the boy could work miracles.

108

He ended up
fasting himself into an early grave

115
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,030
But he wasn't just for long.

116
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,149
He was murdered in his sleep
after less than a year by his own brother.

117
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,236
Was that truly just of him?

118
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:19,631
To abandon his subjects to an evil that
he was too gullible to recognise?

and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.

125
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,831
And he attended three Small Council
meetings in 17 years.

126
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:46,038
He spent his time whoring and hunting
and drinking

127
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,314
until the last two killed him.

a man who lets his own brother murder him,

130

and a man who thinks that winning and ruling
are the same thing.

131

asks you for your protection

136

against another house with a strong navy
that could one day oppose you.

137

which choice is wise and which isn't?

and heeds their advice until he comes of age.

148

149
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,667
perhaps he'd still be alive.

150

The Mountain follows your orders.

529
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,479
Of course I blame you.

530
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,433
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

531
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,588
Should I be concerned?

532
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,990
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

533

534

I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

without their superiors' knowledge.

536
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,155
So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?

537
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:39,837
Categorically.

538
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,829
I would like to speak with the Mountain.

539
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,270
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

540
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,158
He might not enjoy it
as much as he thinks he would.

541
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,872
I could arrange forthis meeting.

542
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,596
But you want something in return.

543
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,072
There will be a trial for my son
and, as custom dictates,

544
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,832
three judges will render a verdict.

545
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,272
lwill preside.

546
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,318
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.

547
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,432
I would like you to be the third.

548

549
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,989
Not long ago,
the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.

550
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,640
Declared themselves enemies ofthe throne.

551
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,711
Now they are our strongest allies.

552
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,189
Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.

553
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:34,351
Asking me tojudge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

554
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,110
I would also invite you
to sit on the Small Council

555
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:41,555
to serve as one of
the new king's principal advisors.

556
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,637
I never realised
you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

557
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,234
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

558

The King is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.

a Targaryen girl has three dragons.

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,118
Before long,
she will turn her eyes to Westeros.

562
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,588
Onlythe Dornish managed to resist
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

563
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,191
You're saying you need us?

564
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,269
That must be hard for you to admit.

565
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,276
We need each other.

Very well, my wife. Sansa.

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,997

-Gone?

You don't think she...

No one had more cause to kill Joffrey
than Sansa,

608
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,031
but the girl is no assassin.

609
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,112
Whoever killed the King
wanted me to lose my head for it.

Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne
