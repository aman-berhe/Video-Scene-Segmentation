00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:11,116
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

3
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,439
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.

4
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,799
Your son can go on
calling himself King in the North.

5
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,156
The Starks will have dominion
over all lands north of Moat Cailin,

6
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,070
provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,195
And the wording ofthis oath?

8
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,794
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,315
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,389
And in return for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,792
In the morning, l'll destroy my brother's army.

12
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,029
When that's done,

13
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,309
Baratheon and Stark will fight
their common enemy together,

14
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,031
as they have done many times before.

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,999
Our two houses have always been close,

16
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,188
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,599
Negotiate a peace with your brother.

18
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,795
Negotiate with Stannis? (CHUCKLES)

19

You heard him out there.

20
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,798
I'd have better luck debating the wind.

21

Please bring my terms to your son.

22
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,436
I believe we are natural allies.

23
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,793
I hope he feels the same.

24
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,668

When he arrives,
Renly's bannermen will flock to him.

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,754
Revenge.

67
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,236
l have always found that
to be the purest of motivations,

68

but you won't have a chance
to put your sword through Stannis,

not today.

70
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,237
You'll be cut to pieces

If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.

"Your Grace."

78
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,395
Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.

And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

Do you want to be a queen?

81

in some way.

Really? Who'd have thought?

88
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,949
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,

89
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,507
while still others say
it was Stannis himselfwho did it

90
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,669
after negotiations went sour.

91
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,512
Whomever did it, I say well done.

92
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,918
It's not what Varys says.

93
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,468
He says Renly's army
is flocking to support Stannis,

94
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,032
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

95
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,355
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

96
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,351
And I say Father raised you
to have too much respect for money.

97
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,950
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
sooner rather than later.

Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

99
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,588
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

100
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,715
She'll be safer in Dorne.

101
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,757
Yes, I know how concerned you are
for her safety.

102
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,512
It so happens that I am.

Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
and I don't blame her at all foryou.

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,319
So clever.

105
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,075
Aren't you always so clever
with your schemes and your plots?

106
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,877
Schemes and plots are the same thing.

The king is taking personal charge
of siege preparations.

111
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,512
May | ask specifically
what the king has in mind?

112

You may, specifically,
or you may ask vaguely.

113
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:58,990
The answer will be the same.

114
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,678
It's important that we talk about this.

115
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,188
It's the king's royal prerogative

116
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,669
to withhold sensitive information
from his councillors.

ifthe vile allegations

00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:46,231
do you think it will make Jaime

00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,036
we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
and take the city.

179
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,035
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

180
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,190
That's not your concern.

181
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,670
lfyou take King's Landing
with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

182
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,909
lneverthought I'd have reason
to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

183
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,511
Loyal service means telling hard truths.

184
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,758
Oh, truth again.

185
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,150
All right, what's the truth?

186
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,919
The hard truth?

187
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:28,628
She's a foreigner
preaching her foreign religion.

188
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,595
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
and you obey.

189
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,109
What do you believe?

190
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,479
You won those bannermen from Renly.

191
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:45,997
Don't lose them to her.

192
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:53,428
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

193
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:57,792
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

194
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,591
Your Grace, l'm honoured,
but my time on the sea

195
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,147
was spent evading ships, not attacking them.

196
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,752
The other lords won't be happy.

197
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,716
Most ofthose lords
should consider themselves lucky

198
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,949
I don't hang them for treason.

199
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,912
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

200
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,072
GlRL: I've got it! I've got it!

201
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,310
MAN: So it's that one there at the top,
on the right.

202
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,640
Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

203
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,076
Stannis has more infantry,
more ships, more horses.

204
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,593
What do we have?

205
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,195
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

206
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,589
Well, I've never actually been able
to kill people with it.

207
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,954
Good thing. I'd be out ofajob.

208
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,035
What about your father?

209
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,552
He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.

210
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,118
He's very busy.

211
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:05,953
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
is time-consuming.

212
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,157
We won't be able to
hold the city against Stannis,

213
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,672
not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

214
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,875
MAN: Corruption.
CROWD: Yes!

215
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:16,238
We are swollen, bloated, foul.

216
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,474
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of kings

217
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,756
and we're surprised
when the fruit oftheir incest is rotten?

218
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,875
(CHEERING)

219
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,632
Yes, a rotten king.

220
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,475
It's hard to argue with his assessment.

221
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,675
Not after what he did to your birthday present.

222
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,476
The king is a lost cause.

223
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,789
It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

224
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,395
A dancing king,
prancing down his bloodstained halls

225
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,916
to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,149
(LAUGHING)

227
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,910
You have to admire his imagination.

228
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,832
He's talking about you.

229
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,948
What? Demon monkey?

230
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,270
People think you're pulling the king's strings.

231
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,395
They blame you for the city's ills.

232
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,675
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

233
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,909
You don't need to convince me.

234
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,037
Demon monkey.

235
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,638
(MEN LAUGHING)

236
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,993
Yeah, come on.

237
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,399
THEON: You're the crew ofthe Sea Bitch?

238
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:39,794
I'm your commander. Welcome.

239
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,468
Stop.

240
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,678
Stop!

241
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,787
Your captain commands you to stop!

242
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,795
Where are we headed, Captain?

243
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:56,635
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.

244
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,037
There'll be spoils in it foryou, and women,
ifyou do yourjobs well.

245
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,117
And who decides ifwe've done ourjobs well?

246
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,153
I do.

247
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,239
Your captain.

248
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,232
(ALL LAUGHING)

249
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:16,076
l have been reaving and raping
since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.

250
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,875
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

251
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:24,032
Don't reckon I've got much use
for a captain at all.

252
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,950
I'm thinking I can do thejob of captain
real well myself.

253
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,113
All I need is a ship.

254
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,799
You wouldn't know where I could
find myself a ship now, would you?

255
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,276
You could do that,
take the ship, head out on your own.

256
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:46,034
And I will hunt you down, drag you back here
in chains and hang you for a traitor.

257
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,516
Stop. We yield.

258
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,793
Congratulations on your first command.

259
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,394
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

260
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,629
Oh, I'm not here foryou.

261
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,874
lwasjust on my way to Red Harbor.

262
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,474
I've got 30 ships.
There's nowhere to put them here.

263
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,039
Too narrow.

264
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,278
You'd better get out there.
Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

265
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,438
That would never happen.

266
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,875
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if! asked them to.

267
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,191
This lot, though...

268
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,876
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

269
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:28,994
Come on, I'll take you out.

270
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:30,992
Who are you?

271
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,990
Dagmer, your first mate.

272
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,316
Why aren't you with the rest ofthem?

273
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:39,994
Or did they send you to row me out
and dump me halfway in the sea?

274
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,307
That would be good for a laugh.

275
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,278
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

276
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,432
And how am I supposed to prove myself
by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

277
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,872
You're not.

278
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,469
And yet that's the task my father has given me
to prove that I'm atrue lron lslander.

279
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,155
They're all lron lslanders.

280
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,630
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

281
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,436
THEON: The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

282
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,749
The seat ofthe House of Tallhart,

283
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,273
a more impressive prize
than a few fishermen's daughters.

284
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,954
-What, you don't think we could take it?
-No, we could.

285
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,030
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

286
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,269
As soon as Winterfell got word
that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

287
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,318
the Starks would send their men
to take it back.

288
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,068
And then...

289
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,758
Take me to my ship.

290
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,118
The Starks have overextended their lines.

291
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,953
Nowthat summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

292
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,758
keeping their men and horses fed.

293
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,875
The Starks understand winter
betterthan we everwill.

294
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,711
The cold won't beat them.

295
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,315
Our spies report growing discontent
among the Northern lords.

296
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,677
They want to return home
and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

297
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,398
And I'm sure ifthose same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

298
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:07,312
they would report growing discontent
amongst the Southern lords.

299
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:09,835
This is war, no one's content.

300
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,157
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

301
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,629
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

302
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:23,110
And as long as he keeps winning battles,
they'll keep believing he is King in the North.

303
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,593
You've been waiting for him to fail.

304
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:29,473
He is not going to fail, not without our help.

305
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,832
So how do we stop him?

306
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,672
REGINALD: We've worked
through the night, my lord.

307
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,434
Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

308
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,397
Yes, I think you would, Reginald.

309
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,994
And because you're my cousin,
I might even let you wake from that sleep.

310
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,515
Go, I'm sure yourwife must miss you.

311
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,349
My wife's in Lannisport.

312
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,396
Well, then you'd better start riding.

313
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:56,996
Go, before I change my mind
and send heryour head.

314
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:59,073
If your name wasn't Lannister,

315
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,596
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

316
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,433
Not wine, water.

317
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,349
We'll be here for some time.

318
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,429
Girl.

319
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,751
Where are you from?

320
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,558
Maidenpool, my lord.

321
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,915
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.

322
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,630
House Mooton, my lord.

323
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,391
And what is their sigil?

324
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,471
A red salmon.

325
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,153
I think a Maidenpool girl
would rememberthat.

326
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,153
You're a Northerner, aren't you?

327
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,318
Good. One more time, where are you from?

328
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,472
Barrowton, my lord.

329
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,391
House Dustin.

330
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:52,039
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

331
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,396
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

332
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,669
They call him the Young Wolf.

333
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,987
And?

334
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:07,229
They say he rides into battle
on the back of a giant direwolf.

335
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,310
They say he can turn into
a wolf himselfwhen he wants.

336
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,233
They say he can't be killed.

337
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,113
And do you believe them?

338
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,033
No, my lord.

339
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,032
Anyone can be killed.

340
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,827
Fetch that water.

341
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,876
A girl says nothing.

342
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,036
A girl keeps her mouth closed.

343
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,876
No one hears,
and friends may talk in secret, yes?

344
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,878
A boy becomes a girl.

345
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,393
l was always a girl.

346
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,470
And l was always aware.

347
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,110
But the girl keeps secrets.

348
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,309
It is not for a man to spoil them.

Most ofthem are true.

I heard the Halfhand
spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

The whole winter.

386
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:41,148
He was north ofthe Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

388

So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

"Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."

00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,951
They're quite good at killing the better men.

525
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,431
That's not the kind ofqueen I'm going to be.

526
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,317
PYAT PREE: Mother of Dragons.

527
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,116
On behalf ofthe warlocks of Qarth,
lwelcome you.

528
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,799
A demonstration?

529
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,989
Take this gem.

530
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,835
Look at it.

531
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,679
lnto its depths.

532
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,751
So many facets.

533
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:40,238
Look closely enough
and you can see yourself in them.

534
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,832
Often more than once.

535
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,796
Should you growtired
of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

536
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,916
it would be an honour
to host you at the House ofthe Undying.

537
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,792
You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.

538
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,589
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)

539
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,549
My apologies.

540
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,517
Pyat Pree is one ofthe Thirteen.

541
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,637
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

542
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,518
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

543
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,994
What is the House ofthe Undying?

544
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,788
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

545
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,154
and drink shade ofthe evening.

546
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,073
It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.

547
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,516
So soft, they actually believe
their parlour tricks are magic.

548
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,357
WOMAN: You watch over her.

549
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,194
Do I know you?

550
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,879
I know you.

551
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,629
Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

552
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,033
Who are you?

553
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,197
I'm no one.

554
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,310
But she is the Mother of Dragons.

555
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,831
She needs true protectors,
now more than ever.

556
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,473
They shall come day and night
to see the wonder born into the world again.

557
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,438
And when they see, they shall lust,

558
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,076
for dragons are fire made flesh.

559
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,510
And fire is power.

560
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,791
It looked like Stannis.

561
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,392
To me itjust looked like...

562
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,795
A shadow in the shape of a man.

563
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,791
In the shape of Stannis.

564
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,159
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

565
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,036
Will you staythere long, my lady?

566
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,351
Only long enough
to tell Robb what I have seen.

567
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:48,677
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.

568
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,349
My two youngest need me.

569
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,714
I've been away from them for far too long.

570
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,318
I never knew my mother.

571
00:35:58,919 --> 00:35:59,988
I'm sorry.

572
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,673
My own mother died on the birthing bed

573
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,079
when l was very young.

574
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,717
It's a bloody business.

575
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:15,595
What comes after is even harder.

576
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,998
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

577
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,868
will you give me leave to go, my lady?

578
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,952
You mean to kill Stannis.

579
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,794
I swore a vow.

580
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,077
But Stannis has a great army around him.

581
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,673
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

582
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,988
I'm as good as any ofthem.

583
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:36,954
I should never have fled.

584
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,393
Renly's death was no fault of yours.

585
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:42,356
You served him bravely.

586
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,516
| only held him that once

587
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,478
as he was dying.

588
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,793
He's gone, Brienne.

589
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,037
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

590
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:01,112
Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

591
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,638
I do not know your son, my lady.

592
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,430
But I could serve you, ifyou would have me.

593
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,587
You have courage.

594
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,315
Not battle courage, perhaps,
but, I don't know,

595
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,750
a woman's kind of courage.

596
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,196
And | thinkthat when the time comes,
you will not hold me back.

597
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,590
Promise me that you will not hold me back
from Stannis.

598
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,398
When the time comes,
lwill not hold you back.

599
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:47,991
Then lam yours, my lady.

600
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:53,637
lwill shield your back
and give my life foryours, if it comes to that.

601
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,793
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

602
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:07,594
l vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

603
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,032
and at my table

604
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,673
and that I shall ask no service of you
that might bring you dishonour.

605
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:17,309
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

606
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,309

607
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,959
MAN: And it's notjust thieves, my lord.

608
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,474
There's wolves in them hills now,

609
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,629
more than I ever seen.

610
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,472
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

611
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,238
My three sons is away
fighting for your brother, my lord.

612
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,596
They'll fight, keep fighting
till they're told to go home.

613
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,795
l have no one to man my flock now. Only me.

614
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:44,316
I can't keep watch all day and all night.

615
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:49,152
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

616
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,912
to help watch over your flock

617
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,518
ifyou can give them room and board.

618
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:55,512
My wife always prayed for more children.

619
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,909
We'll look afterthem. Thank you, my lord.

620
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,434
And may the gods bless you and yours.

621
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:04,514
Stop it.

622
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,839
lfthat's everyone,
I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

623
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:11,069
-Good.
-Hodor.

624
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,760
-Hodor.
-Ah! Lord Stark.

625
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,237
Torrhen's Square is under siege.

626
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,755
Torrhen's Square
is barely 40 leagues from here.

627
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,793
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

628
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:24,629
Might be a raiding party led bythe mountain.

629
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,596
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

630
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,795
We have to help them.

631
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,156
Most ofthe fighting men are away with Robb,
but I can gather 200 decent men.

632
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,467
Do you need so many?

633
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,199
lfwe can't protect our own bannermen,
why should they protect us?

634
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,115
Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

635
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,191
Won't take long, my lord.
Southerners don't do well up here.

-(B|RD SQUAWKS)
-BRAN: So, what does it mean?

637
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,030
Ask your Maester Luwin.
He's the one studying books all the time.

638
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,317
I did ask him.
He'd never heard ofathree-eyed raven.

639
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,670
Must not mean anything, then.

640
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,749
You're lying.

641
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:07,592
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

642
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:10,472
-You know what it means.
-I never said I didn't.

643
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,391
You didn't give me an honest answer.

644
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,029
That's not the same as being a liar.

645
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,632
Well, it's not far off.

646
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:20,069
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

647
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:25,550
In the godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

648
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,199
Now who's a liar?

649
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,759
What did you see in your dream?

650
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,959
Something bad?

651
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,592
Tell me, boy.

652
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,315
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.

653
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,310
I saw waves crashing against the gates

654
00:40:50,439 --> 00:40:52,999
and the water came flowing over the walls...

655
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:57,430
lt flooded the castle.

656
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,990
Drowned men were floating here,

657
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,991
in the yard.

658
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,630
Ser Rodrik was one ofthem.

659
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,874
The sea is hundreds of miles away.

660
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,194
I know.

661
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,394
-|t's just a stupid dream.
-|'ve got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.

662
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,472
Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

663
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,073
Osha.

664
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,548
The three-eyed raven,

665
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,077
what do they say about it north ofthe Wall?

666
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,316
They say all sorts of crazy things
north ofthe Wall.

-(W|ND HOWLING)
-(HORSES NEIGHING)

668

QHORIN: There.
MORMONT: Where?

669
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:47,871
On that mountain.

670
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,391
SAMWELL: I don't see very well.

671
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,469
JON: A fire.

672
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:56,071
There's a fire.

673
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,633
The people sitting around it
have better eyes than yours or mine.

674
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,113
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

675
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,589
Gives Mance Rayder plenty oftime
to throw a party in our honour.

676
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,630
How many wildlings have joined him?

677
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,598
From what we can tell, all ofthem.

678
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,188
Mance has gathered them all
like deer against the wolves.

679
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:20,871
They're almost ready to make their move.

680
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,513
-Where?
-Somewhere safe.

681
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:26,232
Somewhere south.

682
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:28,834
Can't just march into their midst.

683
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:32,636
And we can't wait for them here with nothing
but a pile of stones to protect us.

684
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,590
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

685
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,708
Mance was one of us once.

686
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:41,355
Now he's one ofthem.

687
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,199
He's going to teach them
ourway of doing things.

688
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,995
They'll hit us in force
and they won't run away when we hit back.

689
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,152
They're gonna be more organised than before,
more disciplined,

690
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,192
more like us.

691
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,309
So we need to be more like them,
do things theirway.

692
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,594
Sneak in, kill Mance,

693
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:05,275
and scatter them to the winds
before they can march on the Wall.

694
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,398
-And to do that...
-We need to get rid ofthose lookouts.

I need to move fast and silent.

697
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:17,389
Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

698
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,474
Lord Commander, I'd like tojoin Lord Qhorin.

699
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,196
I've been called lots ofthings,
but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.

700
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,315
(LAUGHING)

701
00:43:26,399 --> 00:43:28,629
You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

702
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,311
l've fought and killed a wight.

703
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,230
How many rangers can say that?

704
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,594
He's the one?

705
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,556
Aye. You killed a wight.

706
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,915
You also let an old man beat you bloody
and take your sword.

707
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,515
(ALL LAUGHING)

708
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,715
QHORIN: Craster?

709
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,075
In the boy's defence, that's a tough old goat.

710
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:52,834
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, my lord.

711
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,997
It would be no trouble.

712
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,469
Well, I hope you make a better ranger
than you do a steward.

713
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:11,787
Go on.

714
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,837
XARO: So, tell me,

715
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,310
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

716
00:44:24,399 --> 00:44:27,835
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

717
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:29,517
He's my adviser,

718
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,234
my friend.

719
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:32,752
Unlikely.

720
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,599
I can almost always tell what a man wants.

721
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,796
And what about what a woman wants?

722
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:39,671
Much more complicated.

723
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,429
You, for example, what do you want?

724
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,114
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

725
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,553
VVhy?

726
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,436
Because I promised my khalasar
l'd protect them

727
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:52,475
-and find them a safe home.
-(CHUCKLES)

728
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,598
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

729
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,750
I want them because they're mine by right.

730
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,958
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

731
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,433
Ah, a conqueror.

732
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,311
No. I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,

733
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:12,435
except someone normally cares
what happens to cargo.

734
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,114
So you wanted more than you had
and you took it.

735
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:18,988
You're a conqueror, too.
You're just less ambitious.

736
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,308
(CHUCKLES)

737
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,077
What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?

738
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,670
At the gates ofthe city, you bled for me.

739
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,875
VVhy?

740
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,791
I will show you why.

741
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,357
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

742
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,157
The hardest steel does not make a mark.

743
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:49,315
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth
theirweight in gold ifthey could break into it.

744
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,155
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.

745
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:54,556
They all went home empty-handed.

746
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,635
The only thing that can open this door

747
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:59,831
is this key.

748
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:01,274
And behind the door?

749
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,639
(XARO CHUCKLES)

750
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:06,558
And it can all be mine?

751
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,358
All? Let us say half.

752
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,678
More than enough
to buy horses, ships, armies...

753
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,558
Enough to go home.

754
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:20,315
All l have to do?

755
00:46:20,919 --> 00:46:21,908
ls marry me.

756
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,269
That was a romantic proposal.

757
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:29,074
I've already married once for love,
but the gods stole her from me.

758
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,116
I come from nothing.

759
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,918
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

760
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,151
But marry me,
and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms

761
00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:43,510
and our children
will be princes and princesses.

762
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,352
See?

763
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:50,073
l have more ambition than you thought.

764
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,034
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.

765
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:57,878
Robert Baratheon is dead.

766
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,791
JORAH: lfyou cross the sea
with an army you bought...

767
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,110
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war with one another.

768
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,595
Four false kings destroying the country.

769
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,239
To win Westeros,
you need support from Westeros.

770
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,515
The usurper is dead.

771
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,876
The Starks fight the Lannisters,
and Baratheons fight each other.

772
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:23,076
According to your new friend
who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

773
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,078
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army

774
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:28,713
or we'll spend the rest of our lives
rotting away at the edge ofthe world.

775
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,189
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

776
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:34,157
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

777
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,276
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

778
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,555
And if I'd listened to that advice
outside the gates of Qarth,

779
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:41,197
we'd all be dead by now.

780
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,317
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

781
00:47:44,399 --> 00:47:47,709
-but you must...
-Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

782
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,872
-| only want...
-What do you want?

783
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,919
Tell me.

784
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,517
-To see you on the Iron Throne.
-Why?

785
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,794
You have a good claim.

786
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,030
Atitle. A birthright.

787
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,629
But you have something more than that.

788
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:08,993
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

789
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,117
You would not only be respected and feared,
you would be loved.

790
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,910
Someone who can rule and should rule.

791
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:18,877
Centuries come and go without
a person like that coming into the world.

792
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:24,671
There are times when I look at you
and I still can't believe you're real.

793
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,356
So what would you have me do,
as my adviser?

794
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,552
Make your own way.

795
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:49,638
Find your own ship. You only need one.

796
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:52,392
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

797
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,236
And how do | get the ship?

798
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,232
I'll find it foryou.

799
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,830
A sound ship with a good captain.

800
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:08,469
I look forward to meeting him.

801
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:13,631

00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,190
You should stand sideface.

Sideface?

806
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,552
Sideways.

Am I fighting someone?

810

You're practising for a fight.

811
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:00,354
You should practise right.

Did you see anything?

815
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,837
Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

816
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:19,874
Go up the battlement.

817
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,439
Move away.

818
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:33,510
Stand back. He's dead.
