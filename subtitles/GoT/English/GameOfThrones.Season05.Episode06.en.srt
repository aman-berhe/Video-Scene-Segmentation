00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,312
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

183
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,317
He looks strong enough.

184
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:35,196
What about the dwarf?

185
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,828
Worthless.

186
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,275
Cut his throat.

187
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,748
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.

188
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,238
And then chop off his cock.

189
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,278
We'll sell it for a fortune.

190
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,310
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

191
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,595
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

192
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,992
You can't just hand a dry cock to a merchant
and expect him to pay for it.

193
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,838
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

194
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,116
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

195
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,872
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

196
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,790
Guess again.

197
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,717
The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.

198
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,467
(EXHALES)

199
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,990
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

200
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,037
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

201
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,428
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

202
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,159
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

203
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,478
TYRION: The fighting pits in Meereen?

204
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,874
You're in luck, then. You're about to be rich.

205
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,597
You are looking at one ofthe great warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms.

206
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,668
(LAUGHS)

207
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,715
Him.

208
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,474
Him?

209
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,156
He's got to be 60 years old.

210
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:53,032
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

211
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,829
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

212
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,989
They wrote songs about him.

213
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,433
That true?

214
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:16,312
He won the tournament at Lannisport,
unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

215
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,355
(LAUGHS)

216
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,349
The Kingslayer.

217
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,477
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

218
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,949
A fancy game for fancy lads.

219
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,474
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

220
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,028
JORAH: I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

221
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,788
Liar.

222
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,474
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

223
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,790
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

224
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,155
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

225
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,389
I'll prove my worth.

226
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,429
(LAUGHING)

227
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,915
-(SEAGULLS SCREECHING)
-(BELL RINGING)

228
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,958
For my children. Money.

229
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,429
Lord Baelish.

230
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,468
Yes?

231
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,835
Lancel Lannister.

232
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,756
Brother Lancel.

233
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,192
We abandon our family names.

234
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,953
That's quite a family to abandon.

235
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,078
The city has changed
since you were here last.

236
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,832
We flooded the gutters with wine,

237
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,468
smashed the false idols,

238
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,278
and set the godless on the run.

239
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,068
Well done.

240
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,635
I'm here on urgent business
forthe Queen Mother.

241
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,155
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

242
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:54,638
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

243
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:58,428
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

244
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,353
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

245
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,795
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

246
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,347
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

247
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,518
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

248
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,238
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

249
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,232
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

250
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,917
The king's orders.

251
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,036
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras' perversion?

252
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,950
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

253
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,157
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

254
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,950
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

255
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,430
Ser Loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

256
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,670
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

257
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,835
Most curious.

258
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,230
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

259
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,992
A thoroughly repellant woman.

260
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,758
Forgive me.

261
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,111
I know you're still in mourning.

262
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,718
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

263
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,314
She was neither ofthose things.
We both know it.

264
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:04,117
Still, I pity her son.

265
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:08,951
How fortunate the young Lord ofthe Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

266
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,189
I know how hard it can be

267
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,510
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

268
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,432
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights ofthe Vale fight fortheir king?

269
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,869
Young Lord Robin heeds my advice,

270
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:23,678
and I have always counselled
loyalty to the throne.

271
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:25,273
Good.

272
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,312
Ifthere's nothing else.

273
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,358
There is another matter, Your Grace.

274
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,829
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

275
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,711
To my shame, I failed you.

276
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,636
But I have found Sansa Stark.

277
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,829
Alive and well and home again

278
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,955
living at Winterfell.

279
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,156
That's not possible.

280
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,390
My sources are well placed.

281
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,992
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay,

282
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,468
a bastard recently legitimised
by King Tommen.

283
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,116
Roose Bolton is Warden ofthe North
bythe grace of my father.

284
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,988
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

285
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,430
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

286
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,315
Marrying his son to the last ofthe Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

287
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,470
than an alliance with a hated southern house.

288
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,629
lwill skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

289
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,277
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

290
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,838
Patience?

291
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,874
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

292
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:35,674
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

293
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,549
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

294
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,392
Let the enemies ofthe throne
slaughter each other.

295
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,028
And when they're done,
seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

296
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,510
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

297
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,831
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the victor still licks his wounds.

298
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,515
Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

299
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,716
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
ofa kitchen mouse.

300
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,074
Ser Jaime, then.

301
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,879
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

302
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,590
I have no idea when he'll be back.

303
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,272
Perhaps I can help.

304
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,310
The Knights ofthe Vale
are some ofthe best fighters in Westeros,

305
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,277
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

306
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,236
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

307
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,671
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

308
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:27,071
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

309
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,029
What do you have to lose?

310
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:31,357
A brothel keeper?

311
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:32,868
And ifyou succeed?

312
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,915
Name me Warden ofthe North.

313
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,555
I'll speak to the king this evening,

314
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,671
have him issue a royal decree.

315
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,592
I'll not rest until the lion flies overWinterfell.

316
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,750
I'll know you're a man of your word

317
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,558
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

318
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,629
As I said,

319
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,437
I live to serve.

320
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,749
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

321
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,952
-What if he says no?
-He won't.

322
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,792
We've waited long enough.

323
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,709
I want you to be my wife.

324
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,119
Now.

325
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,509
What is it?

326
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,237
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

327
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,548
Ordo you...

328
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,550
We can't. Not yet.

329
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:32,628
Why not?

330
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,710
You know why not. Someone will see.

331
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,075
You are going to be my wife.

332
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,788
I am going to be your husband.

333
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,673
We're allowed
to walk through the gardens together.

334
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,118
How many other girls
have you walked through these gardens?

335
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,588
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you'rejealous.

336
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,114
They do not go squinty,
and you didn't answer the question.

337
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,197
DORAN: They make a lovely couple.

338
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,788
A Lannister and a Martell.

339
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,597
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

340
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,957
We must protect them.

341
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,837
Yes, my prince.

342
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,112
You haven't had to use
that axe of yours in a long time.

343
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,399
I hope you remember how.

344
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,872
I remember how.

345
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,229
BRONN: (SINGING)
The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun

346
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,108
And her kisses were warmer than spring

347
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,159
The Dornishman's blade
It was made of black steel

348
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:36,151
And its kiss was a terrible thing

349
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,116
The Dornishman's wife
Would sing as she bathed

350
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,869
In a voice that was sweet as a peach...

351
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:45,517
All right, that's enough.

352
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,271
I'm coming to the best part.

353
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,315
We're trying to blend in.

354
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,118
Don't want everyone in Dorne
to hear your accent.

00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:40,351
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

534
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,758
(SHOUTING) Tommen!

(WIND WHISTLING)

537
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:06,434
What do you want?

538
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,117
Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

539
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,868
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

540
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,551
You're so beautiful,

541
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,918
but you need to keep him happy.

542
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,514
Ramsay gets bored easily.

543
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,039
You don't want to end up like...

544
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,588
Well, like the others.

545
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,999
What others?

546
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,393
I shouldn't gossip.

547
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,833
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

548
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:55,478
No point hiding any more.

549
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,959
What others?

550
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,636
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

551
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,154
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

552
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,437
But she talked and talked and talked,

553
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,597
and Ramsay grew tired ofthat.

554
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,877
Then there was Violet.

555
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,473
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

556
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,279
But she got pregnant.

557
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:22,112
And, well, that was boring.

558
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,713
Then Tansy.

559
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:27,517
Such asweetgirl.

560
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,310
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

561
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:34,310
after awhile, don't they?

562
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,630
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

563
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,875
Hunt?

564
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,114
Mmm.

565
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:44,954
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

566
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,598
Not so pretty.

567
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,994
But, well, it's your wedding day.

568
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,994
Why am I talking about such things?

569
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,833
What was your name again?

570
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,352
Myranda.

571
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,112
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

572
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,358
Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

573
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,192
And I came along and ruined it.

574
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:18,959
I'm Sansa Stark ofWinterfell.

575
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:23,753
This is my home, and you can't frighten me.

576
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,030
Are you done with your bath, my lady?

577
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,392
Go. I can finish on my own.

578
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,754
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

579
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,234
Yes?

580
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:12,433
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

581
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,792
Ifyou please, my lady, will you take my arm?

582
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,869
No.

583
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:25,593
Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

584
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:26,953
I'm not touching you.

585
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:30,433
Please.

586
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,713
He'll punish me.

587
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,107
You think I care what he does to you?

588
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,829
Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

589
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,952

A woman grown, trueborn and noble.

592
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,193
She comes to beg the blessings ofthe gods.

593
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,439
Who comes to claim her?

594
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:24,917
Ramsay of House Bolton.

595
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,436
Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.

596
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:32,638
Who gives her?

597
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,271
Theon of House Greyjoy, who was...

598
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:46,198
Who was her father's ward.

599
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:51,676
Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

600
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:22,357
Itake this man.

601
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,438
Are you pleased, my lady?

602

Uh, yes.

606
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:20,627
VVhy?

607
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:26,190
Why are you still a virgin?

608
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,994
Afraid of dwarves? (CHUCKLES)

609
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,637
Lord Tyrion was kind.

610
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,916
He was gentle. He never touched me.

611
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,994
You're not lying to me?

612
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:40,868
SANSA: No, my lord.

613
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,189
Lying to your husband on his wedding night,

614
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:46,792
that would be a bad way to start a marriage.

615
00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:53,511
We're man and wife now.

616
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,909
We should be honest with each other.

617
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,148
Don't you think?

618
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,834
Yes.

619
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,194
Good.

620
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,193
Take off your clothes.

621

Oh, no, no, no.

622
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,598
You stay here, Reek.

623
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,873
You watch.

624
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:41,115
Do I need to ask a second time?

625
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,352
I hate asking a second time.
