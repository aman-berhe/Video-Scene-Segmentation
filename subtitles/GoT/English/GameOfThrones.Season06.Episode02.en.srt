Have you seen it done?

536
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,636
I met a man who came back from the dead,

537
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,392
but the priest who did it...

538
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:40,548
It shouldn't have been possible.

539
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:43,676
But it was. It could be now.

540
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,955
Not for me.

541
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:51,632
Not foryou?

542
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:59,077
I saw you drink poison
that should have killed you.

543
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,109
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

544
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:04,030
Everything I believed,

545
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,038
the great victory I saw in the flames...

546
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,712
(SHAKILY) All of it was a lie.

547
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:15,758
You were right all along.

548
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:18,310
The Lord never spoke to me.

549
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,353
Fuck him, then.

550
00:44:20,439 --> 00:44:21,713
Fuck all ofthem.

551
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,748
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

552
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:30,870
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

553
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,350
I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.

554
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:40,834
I'm asking the woman
who showed me that miracles exist.

555
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,872
I never had this gift.

556
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,592
Have you evertried?
