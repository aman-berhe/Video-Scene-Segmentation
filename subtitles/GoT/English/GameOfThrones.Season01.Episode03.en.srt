1
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,273
Welcome, Lord Shark.

2
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,311
Grand Maester Pyeelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

3
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,316
The honour of your presence is requested.

4
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,791
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,388
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,876
If you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

7
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,910
(Doors creaking)

8
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,835
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

9
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:06,876
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

10
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,677
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

11
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,676
Sturdy old thing.

12
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,030
How many kings' arses
have polished it, I wonder?

13
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,832
Um, what's the line?

14
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,076
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

15
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,314
Very handsome armour.

16
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,670
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

17
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,196
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

18
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,879
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

19
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,990
l have a knack for it.

20
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,998
It must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

21
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,038
l was standing right here
when it happened.

22
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,997
He was very brave, your brother.

23
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,838
Your father, too.

24
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,876
They didn‘t deseNe to die like that.

25
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,672
Nobody deserves to die like that.

26
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,551
But you just stood there and watched.

27
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,472
500 men just stood there and watched.

28
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,111
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

29
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,469
You think anyone said a word, lifted a ﬁnger?

30
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,998
No, Lord Stark.

31
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,029
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

32
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,071
Emept for the screams, of course,

33
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,076
and the Mad King laughing.

34
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,712
And later. . .

35
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,235
when I watched the Mad King die,

36
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:26,510
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

37
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,397
It felt like justice.

38
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,794
Is that what you tell yourself at night?

39
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,554
You're a servant ofjustice?

40
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:42,957
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back’?

41
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,631
Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back.

42
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,431
would you admire me more?

43
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,399
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

44
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,955
Lord Stark.

45
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,719
Lord Varys.

46
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,389
l was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

47
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,994
We are all praying
for Prince Jeffrey's full movery.

48
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,192
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

49
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:27,431
Renlyl You're looking well.

50
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,152
And you look tired from the road.

51
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,395
I told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

52
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,079
(Man) But we have a kingdom
to look after.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,150
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

54
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,590
- No doubt Lady Oatelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

55
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,597
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

56
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,757
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem...

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,677
from navel to collarbone.

58
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,755
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

59
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,598
It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord.

60
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,915
It was Oatelyn Tully.

61
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,111
A woman worth ﬁghting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

62
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,708
l humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

63
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,233
Grand Maester.

64
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,510
How many years has it been?

65
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,956
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

66
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,319
Oh, how forgetful of me.

67
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,990
This belongs to you now.

68
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,277
Should we begin?

69
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,197
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

70
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,436
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

71
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,510
(Varys) His Grace has many cores.

72
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,070
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

73
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,879
We are the lords of small matters here.

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,514
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

75
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,915
in honour of Lord Starks appointment
as Hand of the King.

76
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,429
- Mm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

77
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,033
20,000 to the runner-up,

78
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,071
20,000 to the winning archer.

79
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,395
Can the treasury bear such expense?

80
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,233
I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will awommodate, lexpect.

81
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:03,396
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,192
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

83
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,994
- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

84
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,073
The master of coin ﬁnds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

85
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,555
I will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

86
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,353
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

87
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,035
but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

88
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,515
"Counting coppers," he calls it.

89
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,316
l'll speak to him tomorrow.

90
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,555
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

91
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,989
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

92
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,878
There will be no plans...
until I speak to Robert.

93
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,635
Forgive me, my lords. l'm...

94
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:46,951
- I had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

95
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,435
We serve at your pleasure.

96
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,155
- Owl
- Please, it's nearly healed.

97
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,870
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

98
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,555
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

99
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,195
I'm not like him. I didn't ﬁght off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.

100
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,829
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

101
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,837
That's not true. You killed the beast.

102
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,997
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

103
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,394
I didn‘t, I...

104
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,991
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

105
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,516
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

106
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,871
Doth to marry her?

107
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,676
Yes.

108
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,869
She's very beautiful and young.

109
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,071
If you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

110
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:47,351
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

111
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,198
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

112
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,754
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

113
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,838
You are my darling boy and the world
will be unctly as you want it to be.

114
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,508
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

115
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,358
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

116
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:11,113
The cccasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

117
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,628
We allow the northemers too much power.

118
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,034
They consider themselves our equals.

119
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,639
How would you handle them?

120
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,151
l'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,429
A royal army?

122
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,277
Why should every lord
command his own men?

123
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,475
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

124
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,517
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

125
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,232
trained by experienced soldiers,

126
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:36,795
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

127
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,158
And ifthe northemers rebel?

128
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,793
l'd crush them.

129
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,879
Seize Winterfell and install someone
loyal to the realm as warden of the North.

130
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,278
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

131
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,914
And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they ﬁght for you or their lord?

132
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,110
- For me. I'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

133
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,116
But you've just invaded their homeland,

134
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,840
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

135
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,757
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

136
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,790
It's too big and too wild.

137
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,392
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

138
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,556
couldn't save you and your royal army.

139
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,398
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

140
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,235
and when to destroy his enemies.

141
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,833
Soyou agree...

142
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,113
the Starks are enemies?

143
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,710
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

144
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,229
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

145
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:30,236
- l'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

146
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,190
- The prince.
- Arya, stopl

147
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,311
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my ﬁiend.

148
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,667
The Hound killed your ﬁiend.

149
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,108
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

150
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,469
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

151
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,715
Mycah would be alive.

152
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,158
Enoughl

153
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,278
What's happening here?

154
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,516
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

155
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,395
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

156
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,552
That's for you, love.

157
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,191
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

158
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,513
Don't you like it?

159
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,039
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.

160
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:30,508
It's all right. Go on.

161
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,351
War was easier than daughters.

162
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,190
- (Knock on door)
- Go awayl

163
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,674
(Ned) Arya, open the door.

164
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,395
May I come in?

165
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,234
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

166
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:12,951
Give it to me.

167
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,112
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mildren's work

168
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,918
Where did you get this?

169
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,829
This is no toy.

170
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,479
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

171
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,431
And I don't want to be a lady.

172
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:40,672
Come here.

173
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,911
Now what do you want with this?

174
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,270
It's called Needle.

175
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,356
Oh, a blade with a name.

176
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,875
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

177
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,871
Your sister?

178
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,149
Do you know the ﬁrst thing
about sword ﬁghting?

179
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,958
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

180
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,752
(Laughs) That's the essence of it.

181
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,551
l was trying to learn.

182
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,870
| asked Mycah to practice with me.

183
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,236
| asked him. It was my fault.

184
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,311
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

185
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,668
I hate them. I hate all of them.

186
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,949
The Hound, the queen and the king

187
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,553
and Jeffrey and Sansa.

188
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,193
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

189
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:38,673
and asked to call the prince a liar.

190
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,193
Sowas II He isa liar.

191
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,230
Shh, darling, listen to me.

192
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,188
Sansa will be married
to Jeffrey someday.

193
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,831
She cannot betray him.

194
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,474
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

195
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,278
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

196
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,917
Well...

197
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,875
Look at me.

198
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,991
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

199
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,474
Winter is coming.

200
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,428
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

201
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,790
But now winter is truly coming.

202
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,708
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

203
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,113
look after one another.

204
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,434
Sansa is your sister.

205
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,750
I don't hate her.

206
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,708
Not really.

207
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,668
I don't want to ﬁighten you,
but I won't lie to you either.

208
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:38,108
We've come to a dangerous place.

209
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,428
We cannot ﬁght a war amongst ourselves.

210
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,311
All right?

211
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,514
Go on. It's yours.

212
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,478
lcankeepit?

213
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,396
Try not to stab your sister with it.

214
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,032
(Chuckles)

215
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:07,753
If you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

216
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,188
(Door opens, closes)

217
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,751
(Oawing)

218
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,794
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

219
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,667
- l knowastoryaboutacrow.
- I hate your stories.

220
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,757
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.

221
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,320
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

222
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,231
Those were always your favourites.

223
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,515
Those weren't my favourites.

224
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,034
My favourites were the scary ones.

225
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:43,398
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

226
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,590
Fear is for the winter,

227
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,792
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

228
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,152
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

229
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,035
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

230
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,634
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

231
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,796
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

232
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,227
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

233
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:15,078
Kings froze to death in their castles,

234
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,235
same as the shepherds in their huts.

235
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:21,875
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them stawe,

236
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:26,117
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

237
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,600
So is this the sort of story that you like?

238
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,033
In that darkness, the white walkers
came for the ﬁrst time.

239
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,033
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

240
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,151
riding their dead horses,

241
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,908
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

242
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,110
(Door rattles)

243
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,031
What are you telling him now

244
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,349
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

245
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,954
Get your supper. I want some time with him.

246
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,355
- (Door closes)
- One time she told me

247
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,556
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

248
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,318
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

249
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,431
Maybe we do.

250
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,750
How do you feel?

251
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,231
You still don't remember anything?

252
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,159
Bran, I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

253
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,997
In the wind, in the rain...

254
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,076
A thousand times.

255
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,316
- You never fall.
- I did though.

256
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,355
It's true, isn't it,

257
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,591
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

258
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,628
I'd rather be dead.

259
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,998
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

260
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,673
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

261
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,755
But still too many.

262
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,307
It's nine years since I've set foot
in the capital.

263
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,512
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came, either.

264
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,354
My lady.

265
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,477
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

266
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,312
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

267
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,510
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

268
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,278
Instructed?

269
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,908
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

270
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,592
Follow me, Lady Stark.

271
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,228
Oatl

272
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,476
Go on. Go upstairs.

273
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,187
You little worrnl

274
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,312
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

275
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,672
Pssstl

276
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:13,917
I meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

277
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,828
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

278
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,314
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

279
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,790
I'm truly sorry...about the Iccale.

280
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,070
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

281
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,997
A dear ﬁiend told me.

282
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,399
- Lady Stark
- Lord Varys.

283
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,307
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

284
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,714
Your poor hands.

285
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,639
How did you know I was coming?

286
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,029
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

287
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,148
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

288
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,954
My little birds are everywhere...

289
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,109
even in the North.

290
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,555
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

291
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,670
Valyrian steel.

292
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,433
Do you know whose dagger this is?

293
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,949
I must admit I do not.

294
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,394
Well, well, this is an historic day.

295
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,551
Something you don't know that I do.

296
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,514
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

297
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,428
- It's mine.
- Yours?

298
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,598
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Jeffrey's last nameday.

299
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,471
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

300
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,277
as any sane man would.

301
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:43,154
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
I lost this dagger.

302
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,310
To whom?

303
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,237
Tyr'ion Lannister.

304
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,475
The Imp.

305
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,067
(Man) Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

306
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,111
(Grunting)

307
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,993
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

308
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:05,512
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

309
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,474
PYP-

310
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,387
Do you think Ned Starks bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

311
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,599
(Shouts)

312
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,069
(Coughs)

313
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,952
Nextl

314
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,235
(Grunting)

315
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,670
Nextl

316
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,675
(Grunting)

317
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,277
Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

318
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,428
Go clean yourselves upl

319
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,193
There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.

320
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,589
A charming man.

321
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,077
I don't need him to be charming.

322
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,118
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

323
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,592
into men of the Night's Watch.

324
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,919
And hovfs that going,
Commander Morrnont?

325
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,472
Slowly.

326
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:13,791
A raven came...for Ned Starks son.

327
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,915
Good news or bad?

328
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,552
Both.

329
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,957
(Maester Pycelle) Lord Stark.

330
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,759
(thczing) I meant...
to give you this earlier.

331
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,871
So forgetful these days.

332
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,313
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

333
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,709
Good news?

334
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,430
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

335
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,354
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

336
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,271
(Woman) Yes, I'm looking at you.

337
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,998
(Laughter)

338
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,390
I thought that she'd be safest in here.

339
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,158
One of several such
establishments I own.

340
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,833
You're a funny man.

341
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:24,234
Huh? A very funny man.

342
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,597
Nedl

343
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,758
Ah, the Starks...

344
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:38,598
Quick tempers, slow minds.

345
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,994
You broke my nose, bastardl

346
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:54,994
It's an improvement.

347
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:00,838
If we threw you over the Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

348
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,109
I wonder ifthey'd ﬁnd you
before the wolves did.

349
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,474
(Door opens)

350
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,630
What are you looking at, halfrnan?

351
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:12,193
I'm looking at you.

352
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:17,232
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

353
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,238
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

354
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,872
All of you.

355
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,035
And what do you car'e about our faces?

356
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,832
It's just...

357
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:30,747
I think they would look maNeIlous
dmorating spikes in King's Landing.

358
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,678
Perhaps I'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

359
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,075
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

360
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,911
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

361
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,314
No one but you.

362
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,795
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

363
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,911
Grenn's father left him too...

364
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,032
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

365
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,952
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

366
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:06,196
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

367
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,835
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

368
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:13,668
I've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

369
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,597
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

370
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:19,917
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

371
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,395
I don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

372
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,431
before they came here.

373
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,476
Oh...

374
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,555
Your brother Bran.

375
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,589
He's woken up.

376
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,798
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

377
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,068
would be considered treason.

378
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,316
We have proof. We have the blade.

379
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,351
Which Lord Tyr'ion will say
was stolen from him.

380
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,834
The only man who could say otherwise
has no throat,

381
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,153
thanks to your boy's wolf.

382
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,879
Petyr has promised
to help us ﬁnd the truth.

383
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,118
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

384
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,594
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

385
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,357
A fool's task. admittedly,

386
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:03,913
but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

387
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,996
I won't forget this.

388
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,075
You're a true ﬁiend.

389
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,192
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

390
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,308
(Knock on door)

391
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,588
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

392
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,391
He's a child. Ten years old.

393
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,749
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

394
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,235
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

395
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,989
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

396
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,076
Then what are you raving about?

397
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,476
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

398
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,749
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

399
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:39,554
We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

400
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,638
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

401
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,273
They can write a ballad about us -

402
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,991
"The War For Cersei's Cunt."

403
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,719
(Laughs)

404
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,231
- Let me go.
- Never.

405
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,954
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

406
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,916
And if he does, I'll kill him.

407
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,237
Him, Ned Stark. the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,

408
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,637
until you and I are the only people
left in this world.

409
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,070
I wish I could see the girls.

410
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,272
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

411
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,429
Until we know who our enemies are.

412
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,551
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

413
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,477
In my bones, I know it.

414
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,396
Littleﬁnger's right.

415
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,149
I can't do anything without proof.

416
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,713
And if you ﬁnd the proof?

417
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,756
Then I bring it to Robert...

418
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:43,439
and hope he's still the man I once knew.

419
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,197
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

420
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,475
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

421
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:52,032
My temper? (Chuckles)

422
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,875
Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littleﬁnger yesterday.

423
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,231
He still loves you.

424
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,037
Does he?

425
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,472
Off with you.

426
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,836
(Horse snorts)

427
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,392
Yes, it's been a long time.

428
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,873
But I still remember every face.

429
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:04,430
You remember your ﬁrst?

430
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,791
Of course, Your Grace.

431
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,797
Whowas it?

432
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,432
A Tyroshi.

433
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,155
- Never Ieamed the name.
- Hmm.

434
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,395
How did you do it?

435
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,350
Lance through the heart.

436
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,117
Quick one.

437
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,709
Lucky for you.

438
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,434
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

439
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,272
My horsetookan arrowso I wasonfoot,
slogging through the mud.

440
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,593
He came running at me,
this dumb high-bom lad,

441
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:45,190
thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.

442
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,437
I knocked him down with the hammer.

443
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,794
Gods, I was strong then.

444
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,513
Caved in his breastplate.

445
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:56,790
Probably shattered every rib he had.

446
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:00,357
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

447
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,279
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, 'Waitl Wait."

448
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,389
(Laughs)

449
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:15,189
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

450
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,433
They don't put that part in the songs.

451
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,278
Stupid boy.

452
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,275
Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

453
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,837
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

454
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,356
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

455
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,239
his sons would be ingrates,

456
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,632
and he'd be waking three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.

457
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,431
Winel

458
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,271
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

459
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,788
Lancel Lannister.

460
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,798
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

461
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,955
(Laughs)

462
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,711
What are you doing?

463
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:11,593
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?

464
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,392
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?l

465
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,509
So get more.

466
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,514
Tell your cousin to get in here.

467
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,592
Kingslayerl Get in here.

468
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,832
Surrounded by Lannisters.

469
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:41,508
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

470
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,871
and their smug, satisﬁed faces.

471
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,795
It must wound your pride, huh?

472
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,639
Standing out there like a gloriﬁed sentry.

473
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,708
Jaime Lannister.
son of the mighty Tywin...

474
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,154
forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

475
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,512
So come on.

476
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,517
We're telling war stories.

477
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:12,189
Who was your ﬁrst kill,
not counting old men?

478
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:15,913
One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.

479
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,429
I was there that day.

480
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,511
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

481
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,359
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

482
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,470
Bestmoveleversaw.

483
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:30,672
A good ﬁghter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

484
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,835
Your outlaw...

485
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,279
any last words?

486
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,993
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.

487
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,872
What about Aerys Targaryen?

488
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:44,628
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

489
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,755
I never asked.

490
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,594
Did he call you a traitor?

491
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,597
Did he plead for a reprieve?

492
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,958
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

493
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,635
"Burn them all."

494
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,072
If that's all, Your Grace...

495
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,435
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

496
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,476
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

497
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,715
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

498
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,192
From whom?

499
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,710
If you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

500
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,552
pay tribute or ﬁght.

501
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,318
An easy choice for most.

502
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,670
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

503
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,031
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

504
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,474
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

505
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:06,194
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good ﬁght in months

506
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,153
- and need the practice.
- (Speaks Dothraki)

507
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,316
(Slave whimpering)
(Whip cracking)

508
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,991
Tell them all to stop.

509
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,078
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

510
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,830
Until I command them otherwise.

511
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:23,594
You're learning to talk like a queen.

512
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,551
Not a queen.

513
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,431
A khaleesi.

514
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,669
(Jorah speaks Dothraki)

515
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,269
(Branches rustling)

516
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,752
(Blade clanging)

517
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:04,875
- (Horse neighs)
- You darel

518
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:08,116
You give commands to me? To me?

519
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,515
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

520
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:18,155
I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?

521
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,308
(Speaks Dothraki)

522
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,874
- (Viserys gasping)
- Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

523
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,439
No.

524
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,676
(Speaks Dothraki)

525
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,274
Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.

526
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:35,867
Please. Please, don't hurt him.

527
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,469
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.

528
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,030
(Speaks Dothraki)

529
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,394
Huh?

530
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,999
(Speaks Dothraki)
(Gasping)

531
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,075
Morrnontl Kill these Dothraki dogsl

532
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,794
I am your kingl

533
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:10,752
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?

534
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,154
Uh uh uh uh uh.

535
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,030
You...walk

536
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,397
(Clicks tongue)

537
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,830
(Wind howling)

538
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:12,754
(Metal clangs)

539
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,994
(Creaking)

540
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,228
(Bell dings)

541
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:53,794
(Wind roaring)

542
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,351
(Benjen) I wanted to be here
when you saw it for the ﬁrst time.

543
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,352
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

544
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:17,469
I'm the First Ranger.

545
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,875
My job is out there.

546
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,992
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

547
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,877
The kind I don't want to believe.

548
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,829
I'm ready. I won't let you down.

549
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,279
You're not going.

550
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,351
You're no ranger, Jon.

551
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:37,993
- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no onel

552
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,758
Here...

553
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,996
a man gets what he earns,

554
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,076
when he earns it.

555
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,950
We'll speak when I return.

556
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,914
(Wind howling)

557
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,918
- A bear's balls.
- (T yrion) Oh, you're joking?

558
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,829
all ﬁied in his own fat.

559
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,387
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

560
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,830
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

561
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,909
And how do a bear's balls taste?

562
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,156
A bit chewy. (Laughs)

563
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,193
And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

564
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,878
Do Domish girls count?

565
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:39,910
(Both laugh)

566
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,788
So...you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves

567
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,830
and bring them here as eager recruits?

568
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,598
Aye.

569
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:53,512
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.

570
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:56,392
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

571
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:59,272
Some of 'em's high-bom lads
looking for glory.

572
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,396
They have a better chance ﬁnding feed
than glory.

573
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,634
(Door opens)

574
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:05,995
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?

575
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,119
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army ofjesters in black?

576
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,236
You don't have enough men
to be an army

577
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,795
and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

578
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,474
I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

579
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,278
when you're back in King's Landing.

580
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:24,835
It's something to think about
while you're drinking your wine down there,

581
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,871
enjoying your brothels.

582
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:31,070
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

583
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,274
Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,

584
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:36,867
might be sickness,

585
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,593
might just be the cold.

586
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:41,391
They die in pain.

587
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,953
And they do it...

588
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,995
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

589
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,391
Do you think I'm plump?

590
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,030
- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.

591
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,354
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.

592
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,436
I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.

593
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,869
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

594
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,917
You know, my brother once told me...

595
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,352
that nothing someone says
before the word "but" really counts.

596
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,031
But...

597
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:18,911
I don't believe that giants and ghouls
and white walkers

598
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,757
are lurking beyond the Wall.

599
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,756
I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings

600
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,474
is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened

601
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,591
to live on the right side of it.

602
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,438
You're right.

603
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,111
The wildlings are no different from us.

604
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,871
A little rougher maybe.

605
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,514
But they're made of meat and bone.

606
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:43,113
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

607
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,791
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

608
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,278
You've never been north of the Wall,
so don't tell me what's out there.

609
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,597
Are you going belom

610
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,276
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

611
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:04,037
Oh, I always do.

612
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,950
I think he's starting to like me.

613
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:17,553
(Laughing)

614
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,830
- "Going belovf'?
- Aye.

615
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,595
Into the tunnel and out the other side.

616
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,194
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

617
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,272
So...you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

618
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,828
Aye, day after tomorrow.

619
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:38,508
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

620
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,598
Lets share the road.
I could use some dwent company.

621
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,755
I, er...

622
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,479
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.

623
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,309
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the ﬁnest castles and inns.

624
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:53,714
No one turns away a Lannister.

625
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,430
(Enunciates word in Dothraki)

626
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,117
(Speaks word in Dothraki)

627
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:05,389
(Enunciates Dothraki word)

628
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,919
(Speaks Dothraki word)

629
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,117
(Repeats Dothraki word)

630
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:10,797
Yes, Khaleesi.

631
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,635
Oh, what are you doing?

632
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:17,193
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

633
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,436
You change, Khaleesi.

634
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,115
It's a blessing from the Great Stallion

635
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,154
(Jorah) For a man on horseback.
the curved blade is a good thing,

636
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:35,871
easier to handle.

637
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,759
It's a good weapon for a Dothraldan.

638
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:43,878
But a man in full plate... (Speaks Dothraki)

639
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:45,990
..the arakh won't get through the steel.

640
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,190
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

641
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,078
Designed for piercing plate.

642
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:56,318
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

643
00:44:56,439 --> 00:44:59,237
(Speaks English) Armour.
(Speaks English) Armour.

644
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,827
Armour make a man, errn...

645
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,876
- (Speaks Dothraki)
- Slow.

646
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:07,435
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

647
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,400
My father taught me how to ﬁght.

648
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,795
He taught me that speed defeats size.

649
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:17,558
I've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.

650
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,910
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

651
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:26,108
And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?

652
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:28,548
(Speaks English) He still is.

653
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,954
A man of great honour

654
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,832
and I betrayed him.

655
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:39,749
The Khaleesi wants
to eat something different tonight.

656
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,791
Kill some rabbits.

657
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,876
There are no rabbits.

658
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:47,548
Find some ducks, she likes ducks.

659
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,990
Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.

660
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,350
Do you have eyes in your head?
Do you?

661
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:55,470
Dog then.
I have seen many dogs.

662
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,830
(Speaks English)
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

663
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,634
The khaleesi have baby inside her.

664
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,312
It is true. She does not bleed
for two moons.

665
00:46:08,439 --> 00:46:10,669
Her belly start to swell.

666
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:14,674
A blessing from the Great Stallion.

667
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:16,710
(Woman) She does not want to eat horse.

668
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,399
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

669
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,350
(Mutters)

670
00:46:25,479 --> 00:46:27,913
I need to ride to Qohor.

671
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,594
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak

672
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,836
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

673
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:39,234
The horde's easy to ﬁnd.

674
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,794
(Grunts, swords clash)

675
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,471
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.

676
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,273
Emept for you. You move too much.

677
00:47:01,399 --> 00:47:03,833
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

678
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,072
(Maester Aemon) How many winters
have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

679
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:14,315
Eight. No, nine.

680
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,756
All of them briei'?

681
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,792
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

682
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:22,831
This summer has lasted nine.

683
00:47:22,959 --> 00:47:26,998
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

684
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,355
The Starks are always right eventually -

685
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,788
winter is coming.

686
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,631
This one will be long...

687
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,555
and dark things will come with it.

688
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:42,076
We've been ptcauring wildlings,
more every month.

689
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,428
They're ﬁeeing south.

690
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,512
The ones who ﬁee...
say they've seen the white walkers.

691
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,756
Yes, and the ﬁshermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

692
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,190
One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.

693
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,153
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

694
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,512
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

695
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:04,914
and what lies beyond.

696
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,353
And it has bmome an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

697
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,987
There are less than a thousand of us now.

698
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,679
We can't man the other castles on the Wall.

699
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,638
We can't properly patrol the wildemess.

700
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:23,951
We've bame enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

701
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,834
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

702
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,999
Tell her...we need help.

703
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,716
When winter does come,
gods help us all ifwe're not ready.

704
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,072
It's a boy.

705
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,549
How do you known

706
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,751
I know.

707
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,996
(Wind blowing)

708
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,075
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

709
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,757
It's either me or this cold,

710
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,030
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

711
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:51,798
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

712
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,069
I expect I will.

713
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,159
Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.

714
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,191
If you see my brother Bran,

715
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:01,833
tell him I miss him.

716
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:03,992
Tell him I'd Visit if I could.

717
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:05,313
Of course.

718
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,758
He'll never walk again.

719
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:11,508
If you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

720
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:13,914
You take care, Snow.

721
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:15,791
Farewell, my lord.

722
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,514
(Foreign awent) You are late, boy.

723
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,714
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

724
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,990
Who are you?

725
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,757
Your dancing master, Sync Forel.

726
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,279
Tomorrow you will catch it.

727
00:50:45,399 --> 00:50:47,117
Now pick it up.

728
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,674
That is not the way, boy.

729
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,713
It is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

730
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,634
-It'stooheavy.
-Itisheavyasitneedstobe

731
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,432
to make you strong.

732
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,839
Just so.

733
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,154
One hand is all that is needed.

734
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:09,390
Now you are standing all wrong.

735
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,750
Turn your body sidehce.

736
00:51:11,879 --> 00:51:14,029
Yes.

737
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,276
So.

738
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:18,594
You are skinny. That is good.

739
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,396
The target is smaller.

740
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:23,510
Now the grip - let me see.

741
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,153
Yes.

742
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,794
The grip must be delicate.

743
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,592
Whatifldropit?

744
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:33,949
The steel must be part of your arm.

745
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,594
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

746
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,599
Nine years Sync Forel was ﬁrst sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

747
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,314
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

748
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,078
I'm a girl.

749
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,354
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

750
00:51:50,479 --> 00:51:51,832
(He tuts)

751
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:53,677
That is the grip.

752
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:56,632
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

753
00:51:56,759 --> 00:51:58,033
A needle.

754
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,674
Ahhh. (Chuckles)

755
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,158
Just so.

756
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:05,878
Now we will begin the dance.

757
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,358
Remember, child,

758
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:10,198
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...

759
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,949
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

760
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:17,637
This is the Braavos dance...

761
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,917
the water dance.

762
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,110
It is swift...

763
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,355
and sudden.

764
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:30,637
Do you know this?

765
00:52:30,759 --> 00:52:32,954
If you pierce them,

766
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,510
the water leaks out and they die.

767
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:40,836
Now you will try to strike me.

768
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,558
Hal

769
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:58,158
Upl

770
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,553
(T HIS)

771
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,475
Hal

772
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:14,548
Ah.

773
00:53:16,999 --> 00:53:18,478
Dead.

774
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:19,509
(Laughs) Ohl

775
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,198
Dead.

776
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:23,071
- (Swords clashing)
- Hupl

777
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,471
Very dead.

778
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,318
- (Chuckles)
- (Sync) Come.

779
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,956
Ah ah ahl

780
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,719
- Hupl
- (Swords clash)

781
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:37,196
Again, faster.

782
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:43,310
Ah.

783
00:53:43,479 --> 00:53:46,198
(Weapons clanging,
warriors shouting)
