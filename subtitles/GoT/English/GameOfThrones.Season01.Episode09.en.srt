1
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,956
(Breathing)

2
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,030
(Varys) You've seen better days, my lord.

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,195
Another visit?

4
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,796
It seems you're my last friend.

5
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,639
No, no, many still love you.

6
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:19,796
Sansa some to court this morning
to plead for your life.

7
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,549
On her knees begging for me. Hml

8
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,716
Did you laugh with the others?

9
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,230
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.

10
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,156
I don‘t know what you want.

11
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,838
I've given up trying to guess.

12
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,230
When lwasstill a boy-

13
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,991
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

14
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,396
I travelled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

15
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,837
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

16
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,599
The same is true at court.

17
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,870
I am the master of whisperers.

18
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:59,197
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

19
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,197
I'm a good actor, my lord.

20
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,436
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,471
I could.

22
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,874
But will I?

23
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,238
- No.
- (Laughs)

24
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,236
As I said, I'm no hero.

25
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,031
What do you want? Tell me.

26
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,878
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

27
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,438
Peace.

28
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:26,350
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

29
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,710
Fighting for his father‘s freedom.

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,910
Robb?

31
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,758
He's just a boy.

32
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,990
Boys have been conquerors before.

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,389
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,153
Lord Slannis has the best claim to the throne.

35
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,637
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by ﬁghts.

36
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,238
(Varys tuts)

37
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,195
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

38
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,670
Cersei is no fool.

39
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,950
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

40
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,469
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

41
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,112
who crippled my son?

42
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,070
I want you to serve the realml

43
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,794
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

44
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,831
tell your son to lay down his sword

45
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,032
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

46
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,876
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.

47
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,549
If you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

48
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,147
I believe she will allow you
to take the black

49
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,635
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

50
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,033
(Chuckles)

51
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,515
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

52
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,156
That I would trade my honour
for a few more years of...

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,838
Ofwhat?

54
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,516
You grew up with actors.

55
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,792
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

56
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,114
But I grew up with soldiers.

57
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,396
I learned how to die a long time ago.

58
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,033
Pity.

59
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,828
Such a pity.

60
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,709
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

61
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,149
Is that a precious thing to you?

62
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,877
(Water dripping)

63
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,991
(Oawing)

64
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,152
(Arrow whooshes)

65
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,678
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niwe Walda.

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,389
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think
- (Oatelyn) Keep shooting them down.

67
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,391
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,393
He's Grandfather's bannerrnan.
We can't expect his support?

69
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,115
(Greatjon) Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

70
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,348
Look

71
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,152
(Robb) Father rots in a dungeon.

72
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,270
How long before they take his head?

73
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,270
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

74
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,755
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

75
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,678
We've got ﬁve times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

76
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,031
(Greatjon) Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak

77
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,719
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

78
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,832
and for 600 years
they have never failed to not their toll.

79
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,076
Have my horse saddled and ready.

80
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,197
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

81
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,993
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

82
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,518
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

83
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,794
Whatever it took

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,277
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

85
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,509


86
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,594
- I'll go.
- (T heon) You can'tl

87
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,837
l have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.

88
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,274
(Greatjon) Unless there was a proﬁt in it.

89
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,512
What do you want?

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,076
It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

91
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,838
Oh, spare me.

92
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,873
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

93
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,910
What am I supposed to do with you?

94
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,917
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

95
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:42,835
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

96
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:46,548
- Father, please...
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

97
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:51,878
Your mother would still be a milkrnaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

98
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:58,152
All right, you come forward.

99
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,356
(Smacking kiss)

100
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,755
There.
Now that I've observed the courtesies,

101
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,110
perhaps my sons will do me the honour
of shutting their mouths.

102
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,151
Is there somewhere we can talk?

103
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,230
We're talking right now.

104
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,558
Fine.

105
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,113
Ou‘tl All of youl

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,353
- Ohl
- You too.

107
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,516
You see that?

108
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,595
Fifteen, she is.

109
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,438
A little ﬂower.

110
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,798
And her honey's all mine. (Chuckles)

111
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,348
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,952
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

113
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,910
He is quite ill, my lord.

114
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,998
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

115
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,235
Or the one before that.

116
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,716
Your family has always pissed on me.

117
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:22,597
- My lord, l...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

118
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,957
The ﬁne Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

119
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,877
- I'm sure there were reasons...
- I didn't need reasons.

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,471
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

121
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,793
Why are you here?

122
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,319
To ask you...

123
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,589
to open your gates, my lord...

124
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,029
so my son and his bannerrnen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

125
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,072
- Why should I let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

126
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,555
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

127
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,911
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

128
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,235
Don't try and ﬁighten me, Lady Stark.

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,675
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

130
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,518
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

131
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,834
You swore an oath to my father.

132
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,918
Oh, yes, I said some words.

133
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,077
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember ﬁght.

134
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,359
Joffrey's king now,

135
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:22,910
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

136
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,592
If I had the sense the gods gave a ﬁsh,
l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

137
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,396
- Why don't you?
- Stark. Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

138
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,038
Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?

139
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,750
- (Man) And...engagel
- (Wind howls)

140
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,836
(Door slams)

141
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,838
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

142
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,030
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

143
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,750
You'll be ready for this, then.

144
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,351
I thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

145
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,717
so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

146
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,354
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think

147
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,512
This is Valyrian steel.

148
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:22,948
It was my father's sword,
his father before him.

149
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:26,350
The Morrnonts have carried it
for ﬁve centuries.

150
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,391
It was meant for my son Jorah.

151
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,990
He brought dishonour to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

152
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,235
before he ﬂed from Westeros.

153
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,236
- My lord, you honour me, but I can't...
- Oh, you can.

154
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,991
And you will.

155
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,829
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

156
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,554
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

157
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,037
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

158
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,751
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

159
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,359
Right.

160
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,112
Now, don't think this means I approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thome.

161
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,595
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

162
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,792
I'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.

163
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,196
No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

164
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:18,153
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

165
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,396
I've, uh, ordered Thome
to lay it at the feet ofthis...

166
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,317
boy king.

167
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,153
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

168
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:32,068
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thome.

169
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,667
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

170
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,029
and bring me my supper.

171
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,679
Yes, my lord.

172
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,994
- Well done.
- Well done.

173
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,598
You earned that, Snow.

174
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,350
Well done.

175
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,038
Go on, let's have a look

176
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,354
- At what?
- (Grenn) The swordl Show us the sword.

177
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:12,272
(All) Swordl Swordl Swordl Swordl

178
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,476
Swordl Swordl Swordl Swordl Swordl

179
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,038
(Laughter, cheering)

180
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,118
- Let's have a look
- Piss off.

181
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:24,070
(Laughter, excited chatter)

182
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,873
Come on,
I want to have a look at it in the light.

183
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,557
(Pyp) Give it herel

184
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,476
What is it?

185
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,511
-I...
- Lookat itseyes.

186
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,119
- Give it.
- I can't.

187
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,598
You can't what?

188
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,835


189
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,953
I'm really not supposed to say.

190
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,600
And yet you really want to say.

191
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,597
You want to say that...?

192
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,438
There was a raven.

193
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,351
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

194
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,431
It's your brother Robb.

195
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,231
What?

196
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,838
What about him?

197
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,673
He's heading south.

198
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,517
To war.

199
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,315
All his bannerrnen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

200
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,595
I should be there.

201
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,111
I should be with him.

202
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,678
(Hoofbeats approaching)

203
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,550
If we do that, they'll never get back across.

204
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,951
(Robb) Well?

205
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,677
What did he say?

206
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:48,194
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

207
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,038
- His men are yours, as well.
- (Greatjon) Huh.

208
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,755
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

209
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,153
What does he want in return?

210
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,353
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

211
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,199
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, ﬁne.

212
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,679
And?

213
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,711
And Arya...

214
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,469
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

215
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

216
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:23,158
And?

217
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,235
And...

218
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,397
when the ﬁghting is done...

219
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,675
you will marry one of his daughters.

220
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,635
Whichever you prefer.

221
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,990
He has a number
he thinks will be...suitable.

222
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,917


223
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,909
- Did you get a look at his daughters?
- (Snickering)

224
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,359
I did.

225
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,708
And?

226
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:51,518
One was.

227
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,872
Do you consent?

228
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,434
-Oanlrefuse?
-Notifyouwanttocross.

229
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,394
Then I consent.

230
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,393
(Chuckles)

231
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,392
(Cawing)

232
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,430
Sam said you wanted to see me?

233
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,834
I did indeed.

234
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,792
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

235
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:07,119
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

236
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:10,197
take no wives and father no children?

237
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,878
No.

238
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,638
So they will not love.

239
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:17,994
Love is the death of duty.

240
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,749
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

241
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,074
between honour on the one hand...

242
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,555
and those he loves on the other,

243
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,907
what would he do?

244
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:32,871
He... He would do whatever was ﬁght.
No matter what.

245
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,950
Then Lord Staﬁ< is one man in 10,000.

246
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:39,551
Most of us are not so strong.

247
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:42,197
What is honour...

248
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,880
compared to a woman's love?

249
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,274
And what is duty...

250
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,790
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

251
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,149
Or a brother's smile?

252
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,793
Sam told you.

253
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,831
We're all human.

254
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:04,031
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

255
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,799
Honour comes easy then.

256
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,312
Yet...

257
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,271
sooner or later...

258
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:12,230
in every man's life...

259
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,237
there comes a day when it is not easy.

260
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,276
A day when he must choose.

261
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,992
And this is my day?

262
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,076
Is that what you're saying?

263
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,198
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

264
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,039
- I know.
- You do not know.

265
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,750
No one knows.

266
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,353
I may bea bastard,

267
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,868
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

268
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,955
(Chuckles)

269
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,072
The gods were cruel
when they sawﬁttotest myvows.

270
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,111
They waited till I was old.

271
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,433
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

272
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,834
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

273
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,751
I was helpless...

274
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:03,038
blind, frail.

275
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:06,631
But...

276
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,069
when I heard they had
killed my brother's son...

277
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,191
and his poor son...

278
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,634
and the childrenl

279
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,954
Even the little children.

280
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,548
Who are you?

281
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,235
My father was Maelcar,

282
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,350
the ﬁrst of his name.

283
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:31,552
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

284
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,433
when I had refused the throne.

285
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,791
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

286
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,717
whom they called the Mad King.

287
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,431
You're Aemon Targaryen.

288
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,999
I'm a maester of the Citadel,

289
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,113
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

290
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:57,912
I will not tell you...to stay or go.

291
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,399
You must make that choice yourself...

292
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,591
and live with it for the rest of your days.

293
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,435
Aslhave.

294
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,995
My lord...

295
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,509
My sun and stars...

296
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,518
Drogo.

297
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,711
(Mutters)

298
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,437
(Grunts)

299
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,838
(Speaks Dothraki)

300
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,031
My horse...

301
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,912
Blood of my blood...

302
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,749
No, I must ﬁde.

303
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,188
He fell from his horse.

304
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,673
A Khal who cannot ﬁde is no Khal.

305
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,758
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

306
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,958
We've ﬁdden far enough today.
We'll camp here.

307
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,155
This is no place to camp.

308
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,317
A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.

309
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,267
We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

310
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,788
You do not command me Khaleesi.

311
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,910
Find Mirﬁ Maz Duur.
Bﬁng her to me.

312
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,513
The witch?
I'll bﬁng you her head, Khaleesi.

313
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:32,157
Bﬁng her to me unharmed
or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

314
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,868
Hyahl Hyahl

315
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:03,314
(Kevan) Our scouts tell us the Staﬁ< host
has moved south from the Twins

316
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,674
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

317
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,189
They're a day's march north.

318
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,589
The boy may lack expeﬁence and sense,

319
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:13,074
but he does have a certain mindless...

320
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,593
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

321
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,990
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

322
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,395
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

323
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,475
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

324
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,837
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battleaxes.

325
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:32,314
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

326
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,158
Shagga likes axes.

327
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,791
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

328
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,398
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

329
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,034
Me and the tﬁbesmen on the front lines?

330
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,389
(Kevan) They do seem rather ferocious.

331
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,512
(T yﬁon) Ferocious?

332
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,151
Last night...a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

333
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,829
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

334
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,473
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock.

335
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,558
which was fortunate, but even still,
Ulf is demanding blood money,

336
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,148
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

337
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,271
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

338
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,756
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detﬁmental to the war effort.

339
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:16,109
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

340
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,434
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

341
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,032
Excuse me, my lords.

342
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,587
Where did you ﬁnd one so pretty
at this hour?

343
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,755
- I took her.
- Took her?

344
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,789
- From whom?
- From, uh...

345
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,638
Ser... What's his name?

346
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:53,350
- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

347
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,597
He said something.

348
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:04,113
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

349
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,390
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

350
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,992
Oh, well. (Sighs)

351
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,187
I, uh...
think I'll go and ﬁnd myself one.

352
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,951
Who are you?

353
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:24,309
Who would you like me to be?

354
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,032
What did your mother call you?

355
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,118
Shae. What did your mother call you?

356
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,469
My mother died giving birth to me.

357
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,078
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

358
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,348
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

359
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,032
For...

360
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,232
What do you want from me?

361
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,990
What do I want from you?

362
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,952
(Sighs) I want you to share my tent.

363
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,918
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

364
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,474
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ﬁde.

365
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:58,470
I want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

366
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:02,956
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this woﬁd.

367
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,990
Which it may well be.

368
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,599
And what do I get?

369
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:08,232
One - safety.

370
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,240
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

371
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,880
Two - the pleasure of my company,

372
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,473
which I have heard is spectacular.

373
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,669
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

374
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,273
And three...

375
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,276
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

376
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,069
Do you accept my proposal?

377
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,073
Let's start with your last night in this woﬁd.

378
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,359
(Mutteﬁng)

379
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,032
(Jorah) Khaleesi.

380
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,115
Come.

381
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,470
He's very strong.

382
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,193
No one understands how strong he is.

383
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,270
(Daenerys 93393)

384
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:53,313
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

385
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,956
He can't. I won't let him.

386
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,037
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

387
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,917
We must go quickly.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

388
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,919
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

389
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,917
Doth...

390
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,678
Even if...

391
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,033
Even if he dies...

392
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:18,467
why would I run?

393
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:23,951
I am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

394
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,071
This isn't Westeros. where men honour blood.

395
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,313
Whoever wins that ﬁght will be the new khal.

396
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,351
He won't want any ﬁvals.

397
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:40,995
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

398
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,680
I won't...leave him.

399
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:55,912
The wound has festered.

400
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:58,869
You did this witch.

401
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,718
Stop itl

402
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,318
I don't want her hurt.

403
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,389
No? No?
You don't want her hurt?

404
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:15,035
Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

405
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,629
Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.

406
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,433
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

407
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:29,073
When he dies, she is nothing.

408
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,716
I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.

409
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,917
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

410
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,549
I think you should wear
your armour tonight, ser.

411
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,232
I think you're ﬁght.

412
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,074
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

413
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,316
He's beyond the healers skills.

414
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,715
All I can do is ease his path.

415
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,909
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

416
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,997
You must know a way.

417
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,748
Some...

418
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,353
Some magic.

419
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,992
There is a spell.

420
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,230
Some would say death is cleaner.

421
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,352
Doit.

422
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,838
Save him.

423
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:45,632
- There is a pﬁce.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

424
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,909
It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

425
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,950
Only death pays for life.

426
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,799
My death?

427
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,792
Bﬁng me his horse.

428
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,035
(Whinnying)

429
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,037
Khaleesi. do not do this thing.

430
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,311
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

431
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,238
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

432
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,795
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

433
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,353
(Recites spell)

434
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,034
Go. Now.

435
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,957
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

436
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,194
Take herl

437
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,593
You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

438
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,153
The dead will dance here tonight.

439
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,637
No one will enter.

440
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,038
(Recites spell)

441
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,790
- (Horse thuds)
- Bﬁng him backto me.

442
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,031
(Singing)

443
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,231
What have you done?

444
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,509
I have to save him.

445
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,756
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

446
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,756
- You would have been safe.
- (Grunts)

447
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:53,038
(Demonic shﬁeking)

448
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,789
(Ootho speaks Dothraki)

449
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,114
This must not be.

450
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,672
This must be.

451
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,949
Witch.

452
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,478
(Speaks Dothraki)

453
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,758
No, you can't.

454
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:08,676
- (Grunts)
- Khaleesil

455
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,349
No further, horselord.

456
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,673
(Sobbing)

457
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,474
(Singing continues)

458
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,628
Are you hurt?

459
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,669
- The baby...
- Hmm?

460
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,358
..is coming.

461
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:59,108
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

462
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,555
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

463
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,715
(Groans)

464
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,275
The witch - she can bﬁng baby.
I hear her say so.

465
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:10,516
(Singing, demonic bellowing)

466
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,835
(Singing, bellowing continues)

467
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,351
(Shae) Are you in agony, my lion?

468
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,754
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

469
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,148
The ﬁre is burning your pretty soft skin.

470
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,193
- Ahl
- (Laughter)

471
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,314
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

472
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,396
- Just used to it.
- Dﬁnk

473
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,351
(T yﬁon) Let's play a new game.

474
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,268
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you.

475
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,358
Does it involve the potential
for losing ﬁngers?

476
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,868
- Not if you win.
- Nol

477
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,434
No ﬁre games, no knife games.

478
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,198
- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?

479
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,111
I happen to be a great judge of character.

480
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,350
- This sounds like a boﬁng game.
- It's not.

481
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:17,392
Here's how it woﬁ<s -
I make a statement about your past.

482
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,511
If I'm ﬁght, you dﬁnk
If I'm wrong, I dﬁnk

483
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,392
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

484
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,271
I don't want to play this game.

485
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,230
Fine. Bronn ﬁrst.

486
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,438
Your father beat you.

487
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,796
But my mother hit harder.

488
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,469
You killed your ﬁrst man
before you were 12.

489
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,318
It was a woman.

490
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,754
She swung an axe at me.

491
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,952
You've been north of the Wall.

492
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,831
What brought you up there?

493
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,071
- Woﬁc
- And...

494
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,396
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

495
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,238
so you've never let yourself love again.

496
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,270
Oh, wait, that's me.

497
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:20,038
Your turn, my mysteﬁous foreign beauty.

498
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,638
I don't want to play.

499
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,355
It's funl Look at the fun we're having.

500
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,756
Your mother was a whore.

501
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,834
Drink.

502
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,150
All ﬁght.

503
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,511
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

504
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,748
Drink.

505
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:49,638
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Dﬁnkl

506
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,353
- (Bronn pours)
- Mm.

507
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,233
You wanted a different life.

508
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,954
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

509
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,640
The whole shit-stained woﬁd
could dﬁnk off that one.

510
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,755
So, speciﬁcs. . .

511
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,190
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

512
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,915
I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

513
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,555
So...what's a Iowborn giﬁ to do?

514
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,267
Drink.

515
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,638
- Are you sure...
- Dﬁnkl

516
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,629
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

517
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,149
or I will carve your eyes from your head.

518
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,278
My dear lady,
if I have offended you, I apologise.

519
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,309
My turn.

520
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,395
Fine, ﬁne.

521
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,918
Ask away.

522
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:53,557
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

523
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,472
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game woﬁ<s.

524
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,835
I don't care the way the game woﬁ<s.

525
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,837
Our lord here used to be marﬁed.

526
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,790
- Marﬁed?
- How did you hear that?

527
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:07,070
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

528
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,032
Another night, peﬁraps.

529
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,076
Not another night. This night.

530
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,118
It's not a pleasant story.

531
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,518
Oh, maybe I will cry.

532
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,951
I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stoﬁes than your lordship.

533
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,996


534
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,752
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were ﬁding,
when we heard a scream.

535
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,152
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

536
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,558
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while I wrapped her in my cloak

537
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,392
She was too scared to send offon her own,

538
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,310
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

539
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,754
Her name was Tysha.

540
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,950
She was a wheelwﬁght's orphan.

541
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,156
And she was hungry.

542
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,397
Together we ﬁnished off three chickens
and a ﬁagon of wine.

543
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,513
Impossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.

544
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,592
I forgot how afraid I was around giﬁs...

545
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,957
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

546
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,273
look away embarrassed,

547
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:17,993
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

548
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,350
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

549
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,233
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

550
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,113
For three chickens, I should hope so.

551
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:30,151
It didn't last long.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

552
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,510
But she was good to me.

553
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,511
She kissed me afterwards and...

554
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,912


555
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,830
And by morning
I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

556
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,075
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

557
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,275
and there you have it - man and wife.

558
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,035
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

559
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,548
Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.

560
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,072
Not quite.

561
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:01,033
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

562
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,990
The giﬁ was a whore, you see.

563
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,435
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers...all of it.

564
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,915
He thought it was time I had a woman.

565
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,911
After my brother confessed...

566
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,951
my father brought in my wife

567
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,911
and gave her to his guards.

568
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,999
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

569
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,873
How many whores command
that kind of pﬁce?

570
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,950
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

571
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,270
By the end, she had so much silver

572
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:42,870
that the coins were slipping through her ﬁngers
and rolling on to the ﬂoor.

573
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,477
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

574
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:52,435
You should have known she was a whore.

575
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,309
Really?

576
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,514
I was 16, drunk and in love.

577
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:02,759
A giﬁ who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

578
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,190
As I said, I was young and stupid.

579
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,910
You are still young and stupid.

580
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,238
(Kissing)

581
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,556
(Galloping hoofbeats)

582
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,478
Hyahl

583
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,308
(Horse neighs)

584
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:46,958
(Distant shouting)

585
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,313
(Clatteﬁng)

586
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:55,749
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

587
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,478
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

588
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,033
They're a mile north.

589
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:03,108
- Get my squirel
- You don't have a squire.

590
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:07,310
If I die, weep for me.

591
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,432
You'll be dead.
How will you known

592
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,359
I'll know.

593
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,953
Watch outl Movel

594
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,593
Out of the wayl

595
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,517
- Move asidel
- (Neighing)

596
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,118
Stay low.

597
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,553
Stay tom

598
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,910
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

599
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,797
I was born lucky.

600
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,070
Tﬁbesmen of the Vale,

601
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,427
gather roundl

602
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,395

Black Earsl

00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:57,233
- Moon Brothersl

605
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:00,038
- And Painted Dogsl
- (Men) Painted Dogsl

606
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,912
Your dominion over the Vale begins nowl

607
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,759
Onward, to claim what is yoursl

608
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,836
Half manl Half manl

609
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:11,156
(All) Half manl Half manl

610
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,748
Half manl Half manl

611
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,632

612
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:16,953
(Yelling)

613
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,717
(Horse neighing, echoes)

614
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,556
(Mufﬂed shouts)

615
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,358
(Wagon rumbling)

616
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,878
(Bronn) You're a shit warﬁor.

617
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,598
I'm alive?

618
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,999
You're alive.

619
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,752
Did we win?

620
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,394
We wouldn't be having
this conversation ifwe didn't.

621
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,192
(Screaming)

622
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,275
(Blades slashing)
(Men screaming)

623
00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:29,194
How did our tﬁbesmen do?

624
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,629
Yeah, good.

625
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,798
(T yﬁon) It's nice to see them getting along.
(T ywin) You're wounded.

626
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,796
Good of you to notice.

627
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:42,833
I hear we won.

628
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,394
Huhl The scouts were wrong.

629
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:48,992
There were 2,000 Staﬁ< bannermen, not 20.

630
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,069
Did we get the Staﬁ< boy, at least?

631
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,552
He wasn't here.

632
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,037
Where was he?

633
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:58,389
With his other 18,000 men.

634
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,995
And where are they?

635
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,551
- We should go, my lady.
- Nol

636
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:22,038
My Iadyl

637
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,270
- (Neighing)
- Hyahl Hyahl

638
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,037
(Pants, grunts)

639
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,118
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

640
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:07,278
Lady Staﬁc I'd offer you my sword,
butlseemtohavelostit.

641
00:45:07,399 --> 00:45:09,230
It is not your sword I want.

642
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:12,237
Give me my daughters back

643
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,112
Give me my husband.

644
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:16,591
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

645
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,069
(T heon) Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

646
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,796
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

647
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,838
(Catelyn) Take him away and put him in irons.

648
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:29,348
We could end this war ﬁght now, boy,

649
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,390
save thousands of lives.

650
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,273
You ﬁght for the Staﬁ<s,
I ﬁght for the Lannisters.

651
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,276
Swords or Iances, teeth, nails -

652
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:39,948
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

653
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,396
If we do it your way, kingslayer...

654
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:47,077
you'd win.

655
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,559
We're not doing it your way.

656
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,157
(Greatjon) Come on, pretty man.

657
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,838
(Laughter, cheeﬁng)

658
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,356
- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacﬁﬁce.

659
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,357
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

660
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,674
One victory does not make us conquerors.

661
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:24,430
Did we free my father?

662
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:27,788
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

663
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,676
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

664
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:39,989
This war is far from over.

665
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:52,998
(Bell tolling)

666
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,553
Could I have one?

667
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,397
A lemon one...or any of them.

668
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:15,071
Three coppers.

669
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,355
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

670
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:23,118
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

671
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,673
Piss offl

672
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,675
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

673
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,870
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

674
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,830
The Hand of the King.

675
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,510
(Crowd clamouﬁng)

676
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:19,830
(Clamouﬁng intensiﬁes)

677
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:22,074
(Jeeﬁng)

678
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,630
- Traitorl
- Cowardl

679
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,676
(Ned mutters) Baelor.

680
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:47,948
Baelorl

681
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:56,039
Traitorl Traitorl

682
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,988
(Crowd quietens)

683
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,430
I am Eddard Staﬁc..

684
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,471
Lord of Winterfell...

685
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,830
and Hand of the King.

686
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:33,028
I come before you to confess my treason...

687
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:35,996
in the sight of gods and men.

688
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:39,511
I betrayed the faith of my king...

689
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,511
and the trust of my ﬁiend Robert.

690
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:46,234
I swore to protect and defend his children.

691
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:49,110
But before his blood was cold...

692
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,753
I plotted to murder his son...

693
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,235
and seize the throne for myself.

694
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,678
(Jeeﬁng, clamouﬁng)

695
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,872
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say...

696
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,789
Joffrey Baratheon...

697
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,914
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

698
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:22,278
by the grace of all the gods,

699
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,550
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

700
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,716
and Protector of the Realm.

701
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,909
(Crowd jeeﬁng)

702
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:29,267
(GBSPS)

703
00:50:33,879 --> 00:50:35,710
As... Aswesin...

704
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:38,111
so do we suffer.

705
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,152
This man has confessed his cﬁmes...

706
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,635
in sight of gods and men.

707
00:50:44,279 --> 00:50:46,747
The gods are just...

708
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,190
but beloved Baelor taught us...

709
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:52,668
they can also be merciful.

710
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,913
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

711
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,593
(Jeeﬁng, catcalls)

712
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:07,551
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

713
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:12,793
Stﬁpped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent ﬁle.

714
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,799
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

715
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,590
But they have the soft hearts of women.

716
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,711
So long as I am your king...

717
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:29,512
treason shall never go unpunished.

718
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,709
Ser Ilyn...

719
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,075

720
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,191

Someone stop himl

722
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,797
My son, this is madness.

723
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:52,947

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,230
