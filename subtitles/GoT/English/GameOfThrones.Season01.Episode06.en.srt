1
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,308
(Gulls sawing)

2
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,990
Your pardon, Your Grace.

3
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,230
I would rise, but...

4
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:27,237
(Cersei)
Do you know what your wife has done?

5
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,547
- She did nothing I did not command.
- Who'd have thought she had it in her?

6
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,199
By what light dare you lay hands
on my blood?

7
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,039
- I am the King's Hand...
- You were the King's Handl

8
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,877
You shall now be held awounlable.

9
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:41,832
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?

10
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:46,314
Oatelyn will release Tylion
and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

11
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,509
He butchered my men.

12
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,393
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

13
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,830
- Quiet, woman.
- Jaime has ﬂed the city.

14
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,554
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

15
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,276
I took you for a king.

16
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:03,673
Hold your tongue.

17
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,632
He's attacked one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

18
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,911
I should wear the armour
and you the gown.

19
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,391
I shall wear this like a badge of honour.

20
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,517
Wear it in silence or I'll honour you again.

21
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,596
(Door slams)

22
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,118
See what she does to me?

23
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,959
My loving wife.

24
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,750
I should not have hit her.

25
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,711
That was not...

26
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,911
That was not kingly.

27
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,118
If we don‘t act...

28
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,433
there will be a war.

29
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,510
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.

30
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,069
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

31
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,273
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

32
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,908
And what about Jaime Lannister?

33
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,634
What about Jaime?

34
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,388
l'm half a kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

35
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,154
I don't know what happened
between you and those yellow-haired shits.

36
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
I don't want to know.
This is what matters -

37
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:39,395
I can't rule the Kingdoms
ifthe Starks and the Lannisters

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,876
are at each other's throats, so enough.

39
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,118
As you command, Your Grace.

40
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,797
With your leave...

41
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,472
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

42
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,956
Piss on that. Send a raven.
I want you to stay.

43
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,274
I'm the king. | get what I want.

44
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,957
I never loved my brothers.

45
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,318
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

46
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,950
You were the brother I chose.

47
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,435
We'll talk when | return from the hunt.

48
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,231
The hunt?

49
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,591
Killing things clears my head.

50
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,837
You'll have to sit on the throne
while I'm away. (Chuckles)

51
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,836
You'll hate it more than I do.

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,554
- The Targaryen girl...
- Seven hellsl

53
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,431
Don't start with her againl

54
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,793
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.

55
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,752
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

56
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,628
I swear to the mother l'll pin the damned thing
on Jaime Lannister.

57
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,557
(Door slams)

58
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,591
(Horse whinnies, distant)

59
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,755
Khaleesi?

60
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,958
Oh, Khaleesil

61
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,357
You're hurt.

62
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,675
(Raven caws)

63
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,478
(OEWS)

64
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,955
(OEWS)

65
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,556
(Pounding footsteps, door slams)

66
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,070
(Bran whooping joyously)

67
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,991
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

68
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,792
When are you gonna tell him?

69
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,876
Not now.

70
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,557
- Blood for blood.
- (Bran) Come onl

71
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,148
You need to make the Lannisters pay
for Jory and the others.

72
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,630
- (Robb) You're talking about war.
- I'm talking about justice.

73
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,320
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in
the bannerrnen and raise an army.

74
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,034
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

75
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,435
The Kingslayer rides for Oasterly Rock
where no one can touch him...

76
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,356
You want me to march on Oasterly Rock?

77
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:46,509
- You're not a boy anymore.
- (Bran) Come on.

78
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,398
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

79
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,473
It's your duty to represent your House
when your father can't.

80
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,831
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

81
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,315
(Birds chirping)

82
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,116
Where's Bran?

83
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,676
I don't know.

84
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,551
It's not my House.

85
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,630
(Horse nickering)

86
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,589
(Whinnies)

87
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,676
Robb?

88
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:50,317
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

89
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,276
I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

90
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,913
I don't see him.

91
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,837
Got him hidden under your cloak?

92
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,029
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

93
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,673
Silver.

94
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,634
We'll take the pin and the horse.
Get down.

95
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,629
Be quick about it.

96
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,987
I can't.

97
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,950
The saddle... The straps.

98
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,318
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

99
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,031
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

100
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,469
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killedl

101
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,319
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

102
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,918
The boy's worth nothing dead.

103
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,235
Benjen Starks own blood?

104
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:33,396
Think what Mance would give us.

105
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,671
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

106
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,714
We're going as far south as south goes.

107
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,071
There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.

108
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,599
(Robb) Drop the knifel

109
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,516
Let him go and I'll let you live.

110
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,073
(Hisses)

111
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,315
(Yells)

112
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,551
(Grunting)

113
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,315
Robb.

114
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,999
- Robb.
- Shut up.

115
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,394
Drop the bladel

116
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,351
- No, don't.
- Do it.

117
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,598
(Arrow thuds)

118
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,276
Are you all right?

119
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,710
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

120
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,118
Tough little lad.

121
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,758
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man
until you've killed your ﬁrst enemy.

122
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,870
Well done.

123
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,399
Have you lost your mind?

124
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,152
What if you'd missed?

125
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,589
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

126
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,029
- You don't have the right...
- To save your brothers life?

127
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,720
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

128
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,311
What about her?

129
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,797
(Gasping) Give me my life, my lord,
and I'm yours.

130
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,474
We'll keep her alive.

131
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,198
(Sigh of relief)

132
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,829
(Wind blowing)

133
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,072
Mordl

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,192
Tumkeyl Mordl

135
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,511
Mordl

136
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,709
(Jangling)

137
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,197
Dwarf man making noisel

138
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,478
How would you like to be rich?

139
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,670
Dwarf man still making noise.

140
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,193
My family is rich.

141
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,071
We have gold, lots of gold.

142
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,270
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...

143
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,797
No goldl

144
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,797
Well, I don't have it here.

145
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,036
No goldl (Grunts)

146
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,717
Fuck off.

147
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,831
(Door slams)

148
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,749
I don't want to practice today.

149
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,358
No?

150
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,390
They killed Jory.

151
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,357
My father is hurt.

152
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,550
I don't care about stupid wooden swords.

153
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,438
You are troubled.

154
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,033
- Yes.
- Goodl

155
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,275
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

156
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,477
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

157
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,397
this is not when ﬁghting happens.

158
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,476
I don't like dolls and k..

159
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,350
You're not here.

160
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:29,270
You're with your trouble.

161
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:32,112
If you are with your trouble
when ﬁghting happens...

162
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,752
(GBSPS)

163
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,631
..more trouble for you.

164
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,670
(T uts) Just so.

165
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,554
How can you be quick as a snake...

166
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,471
..or as quiet as a shadow...

167
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,590
..when you are somewhere else?

168
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,750
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

169
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,030
That is light.

170
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,117
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

171
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,592
There is only one god...

172
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,192
and his name is death.

173
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:18,038
And there is only one thing we say to death -

174
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,031
"Not today."

175
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,310
(Dothraki chanting)

176
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,869
(Priestess chants)
(Dothraki chanting)

177
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,190
(Chanting continues)

178
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,396
She has to eat the whole heart?

179
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,118
I hope that wasn't my horse.

180
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,911
She's doing well.

181
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,951

The stallion is the khal of khals.

He shall unite the people

If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

221
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,870
Two eggs - a ship and an army.

222
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,991
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

on my shoulders
since I was ﬁve years old,

226

what they gave to her in that tent. Never.

Not a pime of it.

Don't think I know what you want?

I don't care. You can have her.

00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:23,918
She can be queen of the savages
and dine on the ﬁnest bloody horseparts,

235

on whichever parts of her you like.

But let me go.

237
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:33,592
You can go.

You can't have the eggs.

239
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,232
You swore an oath to me.

Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

241

It means everything to me.

but the gold is still mine.

Where?

257
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:45,750
Where? I don't know where,
but when they free me...

258

You want free?

Go befree.

"Rich as a Lannister"?

274
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,551

Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?

283
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:25,474
I'm a vile man, I confess it.

284
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,511
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

285

I'm not particularly good at violence, but...

I'm good at convincing others
to do violence for me.

You want speciﬁcs, I suppose.

290

When I was seven, I saw a servant girl...
bathing in the river.

291
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,676
I stole her robe.

292
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,793
She was forced to return to the castle
naked and in tears.

I can still see her tits bouncing.

I made the bald man cry
into the turtle stew,

which I do believe my sister ate.

303

At least I hope she did.

Confessing my crimes.

309
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:53,351
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man
to slay my son Bran in his bed,

310

and of conspiring to murder
my sister's husband -

Oh, I'm very sorry.

313

I trust you enjoyed it.

316

Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

317
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,631
But this time ﬁnd a smaller cell...
with a steeper ﬁoor.

318
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:21,598
Is this how justice is done in the Vale?

319

l deny them,

321
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,276
so you throw me into a cell
to freeze and staNe?

322
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,389
Where is the king's justice?

323

to whatever you have to say,

and you will hear his judgment.

336
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,196

You have that right.

00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,591
My lady, I beg the honour.

342

Let me be your champion.

343
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,835

With all my heart, my lady.

352

But the lmp is half my size.

353

It would be shameful to slaughter such a man
and call it justice.

354
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,595
Agreed.

355

00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,277
My lady,

358
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,197
I will gladly ﬁght the lmp's champion for you.

359
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,314
I wouldn't be too glad, ser.

360
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,868
| name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

361
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,352
(Whispering)

362
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,868
The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.

363
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,354
Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.

364
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,270
The trial will be today.

365
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,590
Do l have a volunteer?

366
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,630
(Laughter)

367
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,997
- Anyone?
- (Giaalina)

368
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,437
Anyone?

369
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,629
I think we can assume that no one is willing...

370
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,431
I'll stand for the dwarf.

371
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,557
(Lancel) More wine, Your Grace?

372
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,948
- What was I saying?
- (Renly) Simpler time.

373
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,071
It wasl It was.
You're too young to remember.

374
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:30,831
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

375
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,190
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right there in the open,

376
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,199
vicious as you like,
all but sending you a bloody invitation.

377
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,038
Nothing like today.

378
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,878
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

379
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:47,515
Not as exhilarating as those balls
and masquerades you like to throw.

380
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,550
(Laughing)

381
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,635
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

382
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,232
Once. I think

383
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,874
You think? I think you'd remember.

384
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,759
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

385
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,753
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

386
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,438
and the Riverlands.

387
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,597
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some lucky girls.

388
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,596
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

389
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,471
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

390
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,237
(Laughs) Those were the days.

391
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,038
Which days, unctly?

392
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,470
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

393
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,518
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

394
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,437
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

395
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,756
Or way before that, when dragons burned
whole cities to the ground?

396
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:32,790
Easy, boy.

397
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,797
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the king.

398
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,312
I suppose it was all rather heroic.

399
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:40,039
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

400
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,549
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

401
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:48,311
More wine, Your Grace?

402
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:07,912
(Man) They burned most everything
in the Riverlands -

403
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,429
our ﬁelds, our granaries,

404
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,869
our homes.

405
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,749
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

406
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,037
When they was done, they butchered them
as if they was animals.

407
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,232
They covered our children in pitch...

408
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:27,718
and lit them on ﬁre.

409
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,830
Brigands, most likely.

410
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,708
They weren't thieves.
They didn't steal nothing.

411
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,956
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

412
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,191
It's the King's Hand you're addressing,
not the king.

413
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,072
The king is hunting.

414
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,158
(Squelches)

415
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,350
(Groans)

416
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,874
Fish. The sigil of House Tully.

417
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,515
(Whispers) Isn't that your wife's House - Tully -
my Lord Hand?

418
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,309
These men, were they ﬂying a sigil?

419
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:10,994
- A banner?
- None, your... Hand.

420
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:13,391
The one who was leading them...

421
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,795
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

422
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,991
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

423
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,750
saw him take the head off a horse
with a single swing of his sword.

424
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,235
That sounds like someone we know.

425
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,270
The Mountain.

426
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,312
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

427
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,113
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

428
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,230
The man is an anointed knight.

429
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,271
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannisters mad dog.

430
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,436
I'm sure you have as well.

431
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,155
(Hushed) Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have

432
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,837
for being angry with your wife?

433
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:54,717
If the Lannisters were to order attacks
on villages under the king's protection,

434
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,399
- it would be...
- That would be almost as brazen

435
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,478
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

436
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,112
Well...

437
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,310
I cannot give you back your homes
or restore your dead to life,

438
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,831
but perhaps I can give you justice
in the name of our king, Robert.

439
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,995
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

440
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,911
You shall have the command.

441
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,156
Assemble 100 men
and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

442
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,997
As you command.

443
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,878
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,
the First of his Name,

444
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,790
King of the Andals and the First Men,

445
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,998
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

446
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,954
I charge you to bring the king's justice
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

447
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,309
and all those who shared in his crimes.

448
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,993
I denounce him and attaint him.

449
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,108
(Murrnuring)

450
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,397
I strip him of all ranks and titles...

451
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:02,388
of all lands and holdings...

452
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,551
and sentence him to death.

453
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,912
My lord...
This... This is a drastic action.

454
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,639
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

455
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,035
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My lord.

456
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,310
Send a raven to Casterly Rock

457
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,591
Inform Tywin Lannister
that he has been summoned to court

458
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:21,630
to answer for the crimes of his bannerrnen.

459
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,638
He will arrive within the fortnight,
or be branded an enemy of the Crown

460
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,590
and a traitor to the realm.

461
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:44,550
(Softly) A bold move, my lord, and admirable.

462
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,956
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

463
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,350
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

464
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:54,233
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

465
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,352
Then how come Robert is king
and not Tywin Lannister?

466
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,030
(Clanking)

467
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:10,795
(Wind howling)

468
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,351
Fightl

469
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:33,349
- (Crowd shouting)
- (Man) Holdl

470
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,596
- Attackl Attackl
- Come on, Ser Vardisl

471
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,152
- Attackl
- (Roaring)

472
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,829
(Lysa) Stand and ﬁght, cowardl

473
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,032
(Giaalina)

474
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,309
- (GBSPS)
- Yesl

475
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,834
- (Panting)
- Enough, Ser Vardisl Finish him.

476
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,237
(Yells)

477
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,308
(Woman) What are you doing? Get upl

478
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,193
Get up, get up, get upl

479
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,270
Raise your sword. Raise itl

480
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,627
(Roars)

481
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,118
Get up, manl

482
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,153
- On your feetl
- Get upl Get up and ﬁght, Ser Vardisl

483
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,639
(Crowd shouting)

484
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,228
(Woman) Nol Have mercyl

485
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,635
(Groans and gasps)

486
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,991
Isitover?

487
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,793
You don't ﬁght with honourl

488
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,835
No.

489
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,674
He did.

490
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,353
(Crowd muttering)

491
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,831
Can I make the little man ﬂy now

492
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,796
Not this little man.

493
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,030
This little man is going home.

494
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,911
I believe you have something of mine.

495
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,271
(Coins jingle)

496
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,793
A Lannister always pays his debts.

497
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,633
You wear your hair like
a real southem lady now.

498
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:31,677
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

499
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,916
It's important to remember
where you come from.

500
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,112
I'm not sure your mother
would like these new styles.

501
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,515
My mother isn't from the North.

502
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,671
I'm aware of that.

503
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,190
Why do you car'e?
Do you even have hair under there?

504
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,395
Yes. I have hair.

505
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,078
I've never seen it.

506
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,309
Would you like to?

507
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,193
No.

508
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,514
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

509
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:06,068
- I come from a very small village in...
- Oh, wait.

510
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,430
I just realized...l don't car'e.

511
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,670
- Sansa...
- Septa.

512
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,872
- (Door closes)
- Now you are being rude.

513
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,958
(Septa) My prince.

514
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,516
My prince.

515
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,118
My lady.

516
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,994
I fear I have behaved monstrously
the past few weeks.

517
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,276
With your permission?

518
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,952
It's beautiful,

519
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,797
like the one your mother wears.

520
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,796
You'll be queen someday.

521
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:58,387
It's only ﬁtting you should look the part.

522
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,473
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

523
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,157
There's nothing to forgive.

524
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,438
You're my lady.

525
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,429
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

526
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,314
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

527
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,510
from the last hearth in the North

528
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,352
to the salt shore in the South.

529
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:27,431
And you will be queen over all of them.

530
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,910
I'll never disrespect you again.

531
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,998
I'll never be cruel to you again.

532
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,195
Do you understand me?

533
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,597
You're my lady now...

534
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,349
from this day...

535
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:48,190
until my last day.

536
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,878
Stop.

537
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:13,830
- Stopl
- Whoa.

538
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,673
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

539
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,756
In a turnip cart?

540
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,553
I'll ﬁnd a ship heading south in White Harbor.

541
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,357
And you can afford that?

542
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,040
Some of my ﬁiends
are more generous than others.

543
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,593
There's a thousand girls like you
in King's Landing.

544
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,790
So I'll have lots of company.

545
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:34,477
Yes, you'll be very popular...

546
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,989
until some fat lord comes to visit
with a big belly and a little prick

547
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,873
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

548
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,116
And what will happen to me if I stay here?

549
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:47,027
Will I bmome Lady Greyjoy,
Mistress of the Iron Islands?

550
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,114
Don't be a fool.

551
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,913
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark
in the streets of King's Landing.

552
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,592
Every man for a hundred miles
will be marching off to war soon

553
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,476
and most of them will never come back

554
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,397
There's nothing left for me here.

555
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,631
Let's go, Steifon.

556
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:04,078
Giddy up.

557
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,269
Let me see it one more timel

558
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,473
Seewhat?

559
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,993
(Coin clinks)

560
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,791
(Laughs)

561
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,516
I'm going to miss youl

562
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,238
I know.

563
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,476
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

564
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,874
- What?
- Listen...

565
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,753
- What about Joifrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

566
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,632
- Is that why you're sending us home?
- What? No.

567
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:46,954
- Please, Father. Please don't.
- You can't.

568
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,833
I've got my lessons with Sync.
I'm ﬁnally getting good.

569
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:54,510
This isn't a punishment. I want you back
in Winterfell for your own safety.

570
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,958
Can we take Syrio back with us?

571
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,958
Who car'es about your stupid dancing teacher?
I can't go.

572
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,868
I'm supposed to marry Prince Jeffrey.
I love him and I'm meant to be his queen

573
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,153
When you're old enough, I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

574
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,794
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong...

575
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:14,956
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want himl

576
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,673
He'll be the greatest king that ever was,
a golden lion,

577
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,439
and I'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.

578
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,915
(Arya) The lion's not his sigil, idiot.

579
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,672
He's a stag, like his father.

580
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,394
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk king.

581
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,238
Go on, girls.
Get your septa and start packing your things.

582
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,634
- Waitl
- Come on.

583
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,273
But it's not fairl

584
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:41,878
(Door slams)

585
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,153
"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."

586
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:16,833
"Axel Baratheon, black of hair."

587
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:20,597
"Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair."

588
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,548
"Steifon Baratheon, black of hair."

589
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,269
"Robert Baratheon, black of hair."

590
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,316
"Jeffrey Baratheon...

591
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,391
"golden-haired."

592
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,635
(Drums playing, laughter)

593
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:11,557
Daenerysl

594
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,557
(Drunkenly) Where's my sister?

595
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,873
Stop him.

596
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,077
(High-pitched) Where is she? Hmm?

597
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:25,273
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

598
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:27,792
The whore's feast?

599
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:30,274
- Come.
- Get your hands off mel

600
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,590
No one touches the dragonl

601
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,551
(Speaks Dothraki)

602
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,193
(Speaks Dothraki)
(Laughing)

603
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,070
Khal Drogol

604
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,430
I'm here for the feast.

605
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,073
(Speaks Dothraki)

606
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:52,429
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

607
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,516
Back there.

608
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,837
That is no place for a king.

609
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,428
You are no king.

610
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,711
- Keep away from mel
- (Drumming stops)

611
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,671
Viserys, please.

612
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,631
(Dothraki hissing)

613
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:11,431
There she is.

614
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:20,914
They can't kill us. (Chuckles)

615
00:46:21,919 --> 00:46:24,797
They can't shed blood in their sacred city.

616
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,067
(GBSPS)

617
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,953
But I can.

618
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,674
I want what I came for.

619
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:46,915
I want the crown he promised me.

620
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:49,671
- He bought you.
- (Irri translating)

621
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,711
But he never paid for you.

622
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,673
Tell him I want what was bargained for
or I'm taking you back

623
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,234
He can keep the baby.

624
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,436
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

625
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,679
(Speaks Dothraki)

626
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,357
(Speaks Dothraki)

627
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,199
What's he saying?

628
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:24,232
He says yes.

629
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:28,392
You shall have a golden crown...

630
00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:32,479
..that men shall tremble to behold.

631
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,276
That was all I wanted.

632
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,511
W-What was promised.

633
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,072
(Chuckles)

634
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,237
(Speaks Dothraki)

635
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,510
- (Bone cracks)
- (Screams) Nol

636
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,073
Nol You cannot touch me.

637
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:15,349
I am the dragon.
I am the dragonl

638
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:18,073
I want my crownl Ahhl

639
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,033
(Viserys screams)
(Speaks Dothraki)

640
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,955
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

641
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,950
(Viserys) No, Dany.

642
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,268
Dany. tell them.

643
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:43,752

644
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,348

Dany. pleasel

648

(Screaming)

650
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,471
Khaleesi?

651
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,551
He was no dragon.

652
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,228
Fire cannot kill a dragon.
