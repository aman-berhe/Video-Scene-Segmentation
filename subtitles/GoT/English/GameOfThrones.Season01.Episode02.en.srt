1
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,953
You need to drink. child.

2
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,990
(She sighs)

3
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,070
And eat.

4
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,875
Isn‘t there anything else?

5
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,838
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

6
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,075
People can‘t live on grass.

7
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,235
(Jorah) In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

8
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,589
they say there are ﬁelds of ghost grass

9
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,791
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

10
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,229
lt murders all other grass.

11
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,668
The Dothraki believe that one day

12
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,757
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

13
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,957
It'll get easier.

14
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,115
(Neighs, snorts)

15
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,911
(Laughing)

16
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,118
Khaleesil

17
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,991
Your hands.

18
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,999
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Graoe.

19
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,395
Master lllylio has
extended his hospitality.

20
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,111
You'd be more comfortable there.

21
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,878
l have no interest
in hospitality or oomfort.

22
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:10,072
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulﬁls his end
of the bargain and l have my crown.

23
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,350
As you wish, Your Grace.

24
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,595
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

25
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,790
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

26
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,311
What did Ned Stark want you for?

27
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,471
Buying from a slaver?

28
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,431
Selling to one.

29
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,391
Some poachers I caught on my land.

30
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,669
Under my reign, you won‘t be punished
for such nonsense.

31
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,552
You can rest assured of that.

32
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,312
(Dogs howling)

33
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,433
(Rooster crows, hen clucking)

34
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,675
- (Moans)
- (Barking)

35
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,709
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

36
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,269
My mother's been looking for you.

37
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,470
We ride for King's Landing today.

38
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,435
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

39
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,755
and offer your sympathies.

40
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,194
What good will my sympathies do them?

41
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,713
None. But it is expected of you.

42
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,671
Your absence has already been noted.

43
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,676
The boy means nothing to me.

44
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:29,029
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

45
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,116
(Whimpers)

46
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,992
One word and I'll hit you again.

47
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,637
I'm telling Motherl

48
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,955
Gol Tell her.

49
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,075
But ﬁrst you will get to Lord and Lady Stark

50
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,030
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

51
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,833
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

52
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,032
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

53
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,230
You can't...

54
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,752
Do you understand?

55
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,431
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

56
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,391
I hope so.

57
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,671
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

58
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,351
Ah. Time for breakfast.

59
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,112
Bread. And two of those little ﬁsh.

60
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,391
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

61
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,871
And bacon, burnt black.

62
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,792
- Hyah.
- (Laughs)

63
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,633
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

64
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,757
ls Bran going to die?

65
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,635
Apparently not.

66
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,070
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

67
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,797
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

68
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,557
Only the gods know for certain.

69
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:03,994
All the rest of us can do is pray.

70
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,868
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

71
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,591
I still can't believe you're going.

72
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,675
It's ridiculous, even for you.

73
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,438
Where's your sense of wonder?

74
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,473
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

75
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,715
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

76
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,831
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

77
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,713
And go oelibate?
The whores would go begging

78
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,637
from Dorne to Oasterly Rock

79
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,751
No, | just want to stand
on top of the Wall

80
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,598
and piss off the edge of the world.

81
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,507
The children don't need to hear your ﬁlth.

82
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,992
Come.

83
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,429
Even ifthe boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

84
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,909
Give me a good, clean death any day.

85
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,589
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

86
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,313
Death is so ﬁnal, whereas life...

87
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,549
ah, life is full of possibilities.

88
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,912
I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

89
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,152
My dear brother,

90
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,839
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

91
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,996
My dear brother, you wound me.

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,429
You know how much
I love my family.

93
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,189
Please.

94
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:40,436
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.

95
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,789
This is your home. I'm your guest.

96
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,955
Handsome one, isn't he?

97
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,951
I lost my ﬁrst boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

98
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,877
Hewasaﬁghtertoo-

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,991
tried to beat the fever that took him.

100
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,951
Forgive me.

101
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,876
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

102
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,910
I never knew.

103
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,837
It was years ago.

104
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:11,635
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

105
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,956
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

106
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,676
The boy looked just like him.

107
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,037
Such a little thing.

108
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,110
A bird without feathers.

109
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,074
They came to take his body away

110
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,635
and Robert held me.
I screamed and l battled, but he held me.

111
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,391
That little bundle.

112
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,430
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

113
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,755
Never have visited the crypt, never.

114
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,917
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

115
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,035
that she return your child to you.

116
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,717
I am grateful.

117
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,550
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

118
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,630
(Bellows pumping, ﬁre crackling)

119
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,470
A sword for the Wall?

120
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,478
- I already have one.
- Good man.

121
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,194
-Haveyouswungityet?
-Ofcourselhave.

122
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,759
At someone, I mean.

123
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,556
It's a strange thing,
the ﬁrst time you cut a man.

124
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,716
You realise we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

125
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,519
and some bone to keep it all standing.

126
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,676
Let me thank you ahead of time

127
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,438
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

128
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,993
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

129
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,953
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

130
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,954
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

131
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,990
Is it "we" already?

132
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,833
Have you taken your vows, then?

133
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,318
Soon enough.

134
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,790
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

135
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,799
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

136
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,076
it's only for life.

137
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,631
Thank you, Nymeria.

138
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,954
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

139
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,674
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

140
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:42,632
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

141
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,829
It's good you've got help.

142
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,478
Watch.

143
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,431
Nymeria. gloves.

144
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,633
(Whimpers)

145
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,516
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

146
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,516
Nymeria. glovesl

147
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,510
l have something for you.

148
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,830
And it has to be packed very carefully.

149
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,469
A present?

150
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,477
Close the door.

151
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,794
This is no toy.

152
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,039
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

153
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,790
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

154
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:35,837
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

155
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,148
It won't hack a man's head off,

156
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,070
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

157
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,754
- I can be quick
- You'll have to work at it every day.

158
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,559
How does it feel?

159
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,629
Do you like the balance?

160
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,159
I think so.

161
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,875
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

162
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,796
I know which end to use.

163
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,072
I'm going to miss you.

164
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,914
Careful.

165
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,518
All the best swords have names, you know.

166
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,551
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

167
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,111
I've got a needle of my own.

168
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:43,270
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

169
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,913
You've said it.

170
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,078
| wish I could be here when you wake up.

171
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,668
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

172
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,073
I'm taking the black.

173
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,353
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

174
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,995
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

175
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,393
I'll know my way around by then.

176
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,755
I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

177
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,352
lwant you...

178
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,078
to leave.

179
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,831
17 years ago

180
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,269
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

181
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,597
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

182
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,667
And now you're leaving again.

183
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,918
l have no choice.

184
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,748
That's what men always say
when honour calls.

185
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,077
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

186
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,909
You do have a choice.

187
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,478
And you've made it.

188
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,312


189
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,555
I can't do it, Ned.

190
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,276
I really can't.

191
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,799
You can.

192
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,354
You must.

193
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,588
You've said goodbye to Bran?

194
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,630
He's not going to die. I know it.

195
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,829
You Starks are hard to kill.

196
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,278
My mother?

197
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,833
- She was very kind.
- Good.

198
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,675
Next time | see you,
you'll be all in black.

199
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,791
It was always my colour.

200
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,631
Farewell, Snow.

201
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,317
And you, Stark.

202
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,629
There's great honour serving
in the Night's Watch.

203
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:27,029
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

204
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,837
And you are a Stark.

205
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,950
You might not have my name,

206
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,990
but you have my blood.

207
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,271
Is my mother alive?

208
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:46,395
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

209
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,991
Does she care?

210
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,113
The next time we see each other,

211
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,196
we'll talk about your mother.

212
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,992
Hmm?

213
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,518
I promise.

214
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,270
(Horse neighs)

215
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,353
Gods, this is countryl

216
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,437
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

217
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,715
I've half a mind to go with you.

218
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,310
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

219
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:56,630
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

220
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,320
- You should have asked me 20 years ago.
- (Chuckles)

221
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,079
There were wars to ﬁght,
women to marry -

222
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,350
we never had the chance to be young.

223
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,037
I mail a few chances.

224
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,230
(Laughing)

225
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,273
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

226
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,231
That common girl of yours?

227
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,032
Bewa. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

228
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,230
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

229
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,915
Bessiel
Thank the gods for Bessie.

230
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,552
And her tits.

231
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,869
Yours was, er... Aleena?

232
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,753
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

233
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,710
Your bastard's mother?

234
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,549
- Wylla.
- That's it.

235
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,671
She must have been a rare wench

236
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,553
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honour.

237
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,636
You never told me what she looked like.

238
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,829
Nor will I.

239
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,156
We were at war.

240
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,919
None of us knew ifwe were
gonna go back home again.

241
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,957
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

242
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,917
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

243
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,237
The worst thing about your coronation -

244
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,271
I'll never get to hit you again.

245
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,874
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

246
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,636
There was a rider in the night.

247
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,830
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

248
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,711
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

249
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,034
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

250
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,070
and a bold man to wield it.

251
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,918
She's little more than a child.

252
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,111
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

253
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,750
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspealdable to you?

254
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,031
What her father did to your family -
that was unspealdable.

255
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,354
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

256
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,390
the woman I loved.

257
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,432
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

258
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,397
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

259
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,028
This Khal Drogo,

260
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,957
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

261
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,718
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

262
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,307
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

263
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,317
They have no ships, Robert.

264
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,273
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

265
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:12,914
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back.

266
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,554
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

267
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,237
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

268
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:27,030
There's a war coming, Ned.

269
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,111
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be ﬁghting,

270
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,638
but it's coming.

271
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,674
(Laughter)

272
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,158
(Whimpering)

273
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,397
(Grunting)

274
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,518
(Fox barking)

275
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,437
Sit.

276
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,232
You'll be fed.

277
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,758
Untie them.

278
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,714
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

279
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,989
Most choose the knife.

280
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,235
Not impressed by your new brothers?

281
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,757
Lovely thing about the Watch -

282
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:17,076
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

283
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,511
Why do you read so much?

284
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:30,631
Look at me and tell me what you see.

285
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:33,710
Is this a trick?

286
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:37,393
What you see is a dwarf.

287
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,557
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

288
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,599
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock

289
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,636
Things are expected of me.

290
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,069
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

291
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,111
Until your brother killed that king.

292
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,270
Yes, until my brother killed him.

293
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,635
Life is full of these little ironies.

294
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,273
My sister married the new king, and...

295
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,755
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

296
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,352
I must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

297
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,917
But ham

298
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,712
Well, my brother has his sword

299
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,028
and I have my mind,

300
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,034
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

301
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,673
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

302
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,357
And you?

303
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,549
What's your story, bastard?

304
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,512
Ask me nicely
and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

305
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,034
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

306
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,432
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

307
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,192
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

308
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,878
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

309
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:03,150
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

310
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,670
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

311
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,950
You're a smart boy.

312
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,434
You don't believe that nonsense.

313
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,432
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

314
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,114
(Wind howling)

315
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,232
(Creak)

316
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:58,473
It's time we reviewed
the amounts, my lady.

317
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,228
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

318
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,591
Talk to Poole about it.

319
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,591
Poole went south
with Lord Stark. my lady.

320
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,148
We need a new steward,

321
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,192
and there are several other
appointments that require

322
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,029
- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointmentsl

323
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,149
(FOOMGPS)

324
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,156
I'll make the appointments.

325
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,716
We'll talk about it ﬁrst thing in the morning.

326
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,750
Very good, my lord.

327
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,358
My lady.

328
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,470
(Distant howling)

329
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,150
(Distant barking, howling)

330
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,029
When was the last time you left this room?

331
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,554
I have to take care of him.

332
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,317
He's not going to die, Mother.

333
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,158
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

334
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,268
What if he's wrong?

335
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,631
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

336
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,351
- He's six.
- (Barking and howling continues)

337
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,552
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

338
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:06,914
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windowsl

339
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,950
I can't stand itl
Please make them stopl

340
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,998
- (Howling, barking)
- (Animal shrieking)

341
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,072
Fire.

342
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,236
- (People shouting)
- You stay here. I'll come back

343
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,554
(Bell ringing)

344
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:22,199
(Barking, people shouting)

345
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,635
You're not supposed to be here.

346
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:39,227
No one is supposed to be here.

347
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,556
It's a mercy.

348
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,432
He's dead already.

349
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,753
Nol

350
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,393
(She yells)

351
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,515
(Both grunting)

352
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,749
- (Crunch)
- (Screaming)

353
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,869
(Slash)

354
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:02,797
(Gasping)

355
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,874
- (Snarling)
- (Screaming)

356
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:09,559
- (Ripping)
- (Choking, screaming)

357
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,596
(Whines softly)

358
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,912
(Horse neighs)

359
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,309
(People chatting, child crying)

360
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,634
(Animals bleating)

361
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,675
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

362
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,549
Everywhere? Even in the East?

363
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,518
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

364
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,435
- It is known.
- It is known.

365
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,269
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

366
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,436
The moon?

367
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,074
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi.

368
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,668
that once there were two moons in the sky.

369
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,553
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

370
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,513
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

371
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,396
and they drank the sun's ﬁre.

372
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:26,357
(Chuckles) Moon is no egg.

373
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,113
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

374
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:31,628
- It is known.
- It is known.

375
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:34,957
Leave me with her.

376
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:46,349
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

377
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,868
Men like to talk when they're happy.

378
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:52,878
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

379
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,152
How old were you?

380
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,673
I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

381
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,318
Nine?l

382
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,194
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

383
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,039
First you must learn.

384
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:12,116
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy?

385
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:15,197
Yes.

386
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,958
Will it take three years?

387
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:19,954
No.

388
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,589
(Wind whistling)

389
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,511
(Horse snorts)

390
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,153
Welcome.

391
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:12,715
(Catelyn) What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

392
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,628
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

393
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,753
I think he was thrown.

394
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,667
The boy was always
surefooted before.

395
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,519
Someone tried to kill him twice.

396
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,358
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

397
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,040
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

398
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,673
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

399
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,389
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

400
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,636
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

401
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,876
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

402
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,195
It's too ﬁne a weapon for such a man.

403
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:49,436
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

404
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,311
Someone gave it to him.

405
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,114
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

406
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,673
If it's war they want...

407
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:59,829
If it comes to that,
you know I'll stand behind you.

408
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,952
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

409
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,513
Hmm?

410
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,472
Too easily words of war
bmome acts of war.

411
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,511
We don't know the truth yet.

412
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,872
Lord Stark must be told of this.

413
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,678
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

414
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,597
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

415
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,792
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

416
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,632
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

417
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,198
I must.

418
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,747
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

419
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,235
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

420
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:31,390
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

421
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,952
Let me awompany you at least.

422
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,958
The Kingst can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

423
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,874
What about Bran?

424
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,233
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

425
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,636
Bran's life is in their hands now.

426
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:48,997
No, Khaleesi.

427
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,832
You must look in his eyes always.

428
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,950
Love comes in at the eyes.

429
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:58,192
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could ﬁnish a man

430
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,072
with nothing but her eyes.

431
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,315
Finish a man?

432
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,910
Oh.

433
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,429
Kings travelled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

434
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,073
Magisters sold their palaces.

435
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,475
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

436
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,993
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

437
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:23,031
and she refused them all.

438
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,231
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

439
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,952
|... I don‘t think

440
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,435
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

441
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,709
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

442
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:34,795
Men want what they've never had.

443
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,116
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

444
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,351
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

445
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:54,308
Then don't make love like a slave.

446
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,837
(Gasps) Very good, Khaleesi.

447
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:06,870
Out there he is the mighty khal,

448
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,717
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

449
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,832
|... I don‘t think

450
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,348
that this is the Dothraki way.

451
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,436
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

452
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,275
why did he marry you?

453
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,034
No.

454
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,239
Nol

455
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,032
Tonight I would look upon your facel

456
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,116
(Girls laugh)

457
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,033
Pardon me, ser.

458
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,914
Do I ﬁighten you so much, girl?

459
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,313
Or is it him there making you shake?

460
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,758
He ﬁightens me too.

461
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,235
Look at that face.

462
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,838
I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.

463
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:27,309
Why won't he speak to me?

464
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:30,272
He hasn't been very talletive
these last 20 years.

465
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:33,232
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

466
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,998
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

467
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,395
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice.

468
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,910
The Royal Executioner.

469
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,187
What is it, sweet lady?

470
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,916
Does the hound ﬁighten you?

471
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,479
Away with you, dog.

472
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:54,917
You're soaring my lady.

473
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:59,070
I don't like to see you upset.

474
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,272
The sun's ﬁnally shining.

475
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,872
Come walk with me.

476
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,870
Stay, Lady.

477
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,198
(Whines)

478
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,556
(Laughing)

479
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,995
I probably shouldn't have any more.

480
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,270
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

481
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:32,232
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

482
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:40,310
(Stich clacking)

483
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,834
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

484
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,751
- I'll get youl
- (Laughing)

485
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,432
Aryal

486
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,675
Owl

487
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,392
What are you doing here?

488
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,431
- Go away.
- Your sister?

489
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:07,832
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my lord.

490
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,911
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my ﬁiend.

491
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,237
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

492
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,428
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

493
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,034
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

494
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,635
I'm your prince, not your lord,

495
00:43:23,759 --> 00:43:27,354
and I said pick up your sword.

496
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,596
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

497
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,471
And you're not a knight.

498
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,910
Only a butcher's boy.

499
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,838
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

500
00:43:37,959 --> 00:43:40,109
- Stop itl
- Arya, stay out of this.

501
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,194
I won't hurt him...

502
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:44,234
much.

503
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,749
(Whimpers)

504
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,588
- Aryal
- (Growis)

505
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:55,873
Filthy little bitchl

506
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,758
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of youl

507
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,474
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everythingl

508
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:03,468
I'll gut you, you little cuntl

509
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,152
- (Snarling)
- (Joffrey screams)

510
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,196
- Aryal
- Nymerial

511
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,149
Aryal

512
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,713
Nymerial

513
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,751
(Joffrey whimpering)

514
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:17,276
No.

515
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,708
No. Please don't.

516
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,069
Arya, leave him alone.

517
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:37,593
(Barks)

518
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,276
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

519
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:45,629
Stay here. I'll go back to the inn
and bring help.

520
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,875
Then gol

521
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,869
Don't touch me.

522
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,838
(Rustling, footsteps)

523
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:55,757
(Man) The wolfs not here.
Look down by the stream.

524
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:00,114
(Nymeria whines)

525
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:05,314
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joifrey.

526
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,431
Go on. Run.

527
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,476
Gol Leave nowl

528
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,830
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

529
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,631
- (Whines)
- (Man) I think I heard a noise.

530
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,672
Gol

531
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:42,867
- (Dogs barking)
- (Ned) Aryal

532
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,114
(Man) Aryal

533
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:47,674
(Ned) Aryal

534
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:50,549
(Man) Aryal

535
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:53,112
Aryal

536
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,358
(Man) Aryal

537
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,471
My Iordl

538
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,555
My Lordl They've found her.

539
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:02,073
- She's unharmed.
- (Man) Aryal

540
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,394
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

541
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,272
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

542
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,396
- (Man) Aryal
- Right, get back

543
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,079
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

544
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:13,309
Backl Back to the innl

545
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,952
All backl

546
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,238
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

547
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,793
- Are you hurt?
- No.

548
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:29,274
Oh, it's all right.

549
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:33,559
What is the meaning of this?

550
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,631
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

551
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,431
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

552
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,919
Quiet, woman.

553
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,998
Sony, Ned. I never meant to ﬁighten the girl.

554
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,350
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

555
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,952
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

556
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,156
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

557
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,076
That's not truel

558
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,634
She just... bit him a little.

559
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,999
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joif told us what happened.

560
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,157
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

561
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,753
That's not what happenedl

562
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,872
Yes, it isl They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

563
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:08,114
- Liarl
- Shut upl

564
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,593
(Robert) Enoughl

565
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:12,517
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

566
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,750
Seven hellsl
What am I to make of this?

567
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:19,513
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

568
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:21,550
She's not.

569
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,988
Sansa, come here, darling.

570
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:28,950
(Murrnuring)

571
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,311
Now, child...

572
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,151
tell me what happened.

573
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:41,235
Tell it all and tell it true.

574
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,714
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

575
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:53,955
I don't know.

576
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,958
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

577
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,275
- I didn't see.
- Liarl

578
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:01,752
- Liar, liar, liarl
- Aryal

579
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,030
- Hey, stop itl That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liarl

580
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:07,475
- Stopl Aryal
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

581
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,510
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

582
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:11,038
whip her through the streets?

583
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:14,071
Damn it, children ﬁght. It's over.

584
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:16,719
Joffrey will bear these soars
for the rest of his life.

585
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,596
You let that little girl disarm you?

586
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,392
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

587
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,193
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

588
00:48:34,439 --> 00:48:36,270
(Cersei) And what of the direwolf?

589
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,355
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

590
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,594
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

591
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,233
We found no trace of the direwolf.
Your Grace.

592
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:50,436
No? So be it.

593
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,516
We have another wolf.

594
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,313
As you will.

595
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,749
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

596
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,433
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

597
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,034
No, no, not Ladyl
Lady didn't bite anyonel

598
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:11,150
- She's goodl
- Lady wasn't therel

599
00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:14,077
- You leave her alonel
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

600
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:16,508
Please, please, it wasn't Ladyl

601
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,272
Is this your command?

602
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:20,752
Your Grace?

603
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,317
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

604
00:49:30,439 --> 00:49:32,316
Ser Ilyn, do me the honour.

605
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:33,792
No.

606
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:36,670
Jory...

607
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,036
take the girls to their rooms.

608
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,475
- (Sansa sobbing)
- If it must be done,

609
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,476
then I'll do it myself.

610
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:50,555
Is this some trick?

611
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:52,635
The wolf is of the North.

612
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,429
She deserves better than a butcher.

613
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,950
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

614
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,991
He ran.

615
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:35,638
Not very fast.

616
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,554
(Whines)

617
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,796
(Whines)

618
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:22,430
(Whimpers)

619
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:31,594
(Soft groaning)

620
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,914
(Lady whines)

621
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,270
(Inhales)

622
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:47,355
(Lady YEIPS)
