because we needed your help.

365
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,156
You came to Dorne
because you needed our help.

366
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,072
What is your name again? Barbaro?

367
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,871
-Obara.
-Obara.

368
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,878
You look like an angry little boy.

369
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:42,598
Don't presume to tell me what I need.

370
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,032
Forgive my sister.

371
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,792
What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

372
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,314
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

373
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:50,194
No? Good.

374
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,918
Let the grown women speak.

375
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,199
The Lannisters have declared war
on House Tyrell.

376
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,195
They have declared war on Dorne.

377
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,556
We must be allies now ifwe wish to survive.

378
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:07,115
Cersei stole the future from me.

379
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,835
She killed my son.

380
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,551
She killed my grandson.

381
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,031
She killed my granddaughter.

382
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,593
Survival is not what I'm after now.

383
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,712
ELLARIA: You're absolutely right.

384
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,390
I chose the wrong words.

385
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,789
It is not survival I offer.

386
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,071
It is your heart's desire.

387
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,388
(DINGING)

388
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,191
And what is my heart's desire?

389
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,388
Vengeance.

390
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,714
Justice.

391
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,357
Fire and blood.

392
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,518
Your ships are nearly ready.

393
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,596
lsawthem painting the sails.

394
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,355
I'm curious to see how the Dothraki
do on the poison water.

395
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,997
You're not coming with us.

396
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,073
New strategy?

397
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:10,597
You want the Second Sons
to attack from the west coast?

398
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,354
If we take Casterly Rock,

399
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:16,871
the Lannisters will have nowhere to run
when you hit King's Landing.

400
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:18,915
You're not going to Westeros.

401
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,749
You're staying here with the Second Sons.

402
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,828
There's finally peace in Meereen.

403
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,558
You will keep the peace
while the people choose their own leaders.

404
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:29,874
Fuck Meereen.

405
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,830
Fuckthe people.

406
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,750
I'm here foryou, not them.

407
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,512
DAENERYS: You promised me.

408
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,433
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

409
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,515
This is what I command.

410
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,950
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,
I'll need to make alliances.

411
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,232
The best way to make alliances
is with marriage.

412
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,317
Who are you marrying this time?

413
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:59,755
I don't know. Maybe no one.

414
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,991
But you need to lure
all the noble houses to the table?

415
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,592
Are you a queen or fish bait?

416
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,918
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

417
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,194
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

418
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,839
So that's what you want? To be my mistress?

419
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:15,908
I'm not proud.

420
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,430
I don't care what perfumed aristocrat
sits beside you in the throne room.

421
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,239
I don't want a crown. I want you.

422
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,113
I love you.

423
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,632
And | make you happy.

424
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:36,718
You know I do.

425
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,035
Bring me with you. Let me fight foryou.

426
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,635
I can't.

427
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,752
The dwarftold you to do this?

428
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,558
DAENERYS: No one tells me to do anything.

429
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:06,836
Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic.

430
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:08,238
I'm no use to you overthere.

431
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,639
Don't get angry.

432
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:12,836
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

433
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:14,398
Who comes afteryou?

434
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:17,471
Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn,
the Mother of Dragons?

435
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,835
A great number of women, I imagine.

436
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:27,677
Specific orders will be left for you

437
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,832
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

438
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:32,398
The Bay of Dragons?

439
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:34,356
We can't call it Slaver's Bay any more,
can we?

440
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,352
You'll get that throne you want so badly,
I'm sure of it.

441
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,431
I hope it brings you happiness.

442
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,034
I pity the lords of Westeros.

443
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,198
They have no idea what's coming for them.

444
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,629
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

445
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,472
How did he take it?

446
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:19,878
No tears.

447
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,959
I know it was hard foryou.

448
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,991
You turned away a man who truly loves you

449
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,674
because he would have been a liability
in the Seven Kingdoms.

450
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,750
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

451
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,750
if it's any consolation.

452
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,438
It's not.

453
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,669
No, I suppose not.

454
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,318
I'm terrible at consoling.

455
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,593
Yes, you really are.

456
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:55,753
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

457
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,949
You have your armies, you have your ships,
you have your dragons.

458
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:06,715
Everything you've ever wanted
since you were old enough to want anything,

459
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:08,596
it's all yours for the taking.

460
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,391
Are you afraid?

461
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,828
You're in the great game now.

462
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,831
And the great game's terrifying.

463
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,395
The only people who aren't afraid of failure
are madmen like your father.

464
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,791
Do you know what frightens me?

465
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:34,754
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

466
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,074
A man I thought I cared for.

467
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:42,277
And I felt nothing.

468
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,318
Just impatient to get on with it.

469
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,675
He wasn't the first to love you

470
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,556
and he won't be the last.

471
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,718
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

472
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,753
Forwhat it's worth,

473
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,400
I've been a cynic
for as long as I can remember.

474
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,759
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things.

475
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,036
Family, gods, kings, myself.

476
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,395
It was often tempting
until I saw where belief got people.

477
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,230
So I said, "No, thank you," to belief.

478
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:26,434
And yet, here I am.

479
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,349
I believe in you.

480
00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:35,591
It's embarrassing, really.

481
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,875
I'd swear you my sword,

482
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:41,472
but I don't actually own a sword.

483
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:44,157
It's your counsel I need.

484
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,673
It's yours.

485
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,034
Now and always.

486
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:50,833
Good.

487
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,709
l, um...

488
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,391
I had something made foryou.

489
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,472
I'm not sure if it's right.

490
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,678

00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,837

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,030
You're not one of mine, are you?

493
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,519
No, my lord.

494
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,238
Didn't think so.

495
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,077
Too pretty. (SMACKS)

497
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,594
Where are my damn moron sons?

498
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,069
Black Walder and Lothar promised
to be here by midday.

499
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,272
They're here, my lord.

500
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:10,277
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

501
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,588
Tell them to come here now.

502
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,556
But they're already here, my lord.

503
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,153
Here, my lord.

504
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,633
They weren't easy to carve.

505
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,152
Especially Black Walder.

506
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,949
What...

507
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,637
My name is Arya Stark.

508
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:57,038
lwant you to knowthat.

509
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,795
The last thing you're ever going to see

510
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,348
is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.

lfyou're at prayer.

517
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,432
I'm done with all that.

518
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:07,674
I came here every day when l was a girl.

519
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,191
I prayed to be somewhere else.

520
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:15,948
Backthen l onlythought about what I wanted,
never about what I had.

521
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,079
l was a stupid girl.

What do you want?

524
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,035
I thought you knew what I wanted.

525
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,553
lwas wrong.

526
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:34,834
No, you weren't.

Every time I'm faced with a decision,
I close my eyes and see the same picture.

528

Whenever I consider an action, | ask myself

529
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,434
will this action help
to make this picture a reality?

530
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,158
Pull it out of my mind

531
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,718
and into the world?

532
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,508
And | only act ifthe answer is yes.

534
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:13,197
and you by my side.

535
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,790
It's a pretty picture.

536
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,676
News ofthis battle will spread quickly
through the Seven Kingdoms.

537
00:49:33,759 --> 00:49:36,068
I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.

538
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:39,389
You've declared for other houses before,
Lord Baelish.

539

It's never stopped you from serving yourself.
