EDMURE: |f| may, nephew,

7
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,508
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

8
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,670
at the Stone Mill which
may have some bearing...

9
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,991
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

10
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,639
And don't call him "nephew." He is your king.

11
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,073
Robb knows I meant him no...

12
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,549
You're lucky I'm not your king.

13
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,995
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory flag.

14
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,673
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

15
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,478
back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.

16
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,755
I think King Robb understands
we won't win this war

17
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,989
if he's the only one winning any battles.

18
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,714
No, there's glory enough to go around.

19
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,552
It's not about glory.

20
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,879
Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.

21
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,154
l seized an opportunity.

22
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,508
What value was the mill?

23
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,230
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

24
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,672
ROBB: Is he there now?

25
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,035
Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.

26
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,192
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west,

27
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,114
into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.

28
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,315
I wanted him to chase us,

29
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,517
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

30
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,591
without a strategicthought in his head.

31
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,591
I could have that head on a spike by now.

32
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,274
Instead, I have a mill.

33
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,028

Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.

35
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,869
Martyn is 15, I believe.

36
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,469
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

37
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,910
Have I sued for peace?

38
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,319
No.

39
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,712
Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's

40
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,518
brother's great-grandsons?

41
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,472
No.

42
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,357
How many men did you lose?

43
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,355
208.
But for every man we lost, the Lannisters...

44
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,113
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

45
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,070
I'm sorry.

Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

65
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,033
We are trying, my lord.

66
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,433
Try harder.

67
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,471
What do we have, then?

68
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,472
Robb Stark and
most of his bannermen are in Riverrun

00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,154
forthe funeral
of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.

00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:45,994
ln Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

71
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,390
which would seem
to make him Lord of Harrenhal,

72
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,469
in practice, not in name.

73
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,548
TYWIN: Let him have it.

74
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,155
The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

75
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,638
The Lord of Harrenhal will make

76
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,159
a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

77
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,197
Forwhich lam
extremely grateful to you, my lord.

78
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,555
Lady Arryn and l have known each
other since we were children.

79
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,429
She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.

80
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,953
A successful courtship would make

81
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,468
Lord Baelish acting Lord ofthe Vale.

82
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,232

83
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,116

taken up arms against him.

87
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,838

absence would present certain problems.

"what a brilliant swordsman."

115
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,638

than I expected. And more predictable.

122
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:01,277

leave for the capital or fight in a campaign,

00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm not easily killed. Men have tried foryears.

353
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,995
I want you.

354
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,877
Your fires burn low, my king.

355
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:53,547
There is another way. A better way.

356
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,114
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

357
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,758
-Yes.
-|'m the one true king.

358
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,238
You are.

359
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,389
There are others
with your blood in theirveins.

360
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,109
You will sit on the Iron Throne,

361
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,390
but first there must be sacrifices.

362
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:12,073
The Lord of Light demands it.

363
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,473
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

364
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,992
To whom?

365
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,552

366
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:31,107
whatever these slaves did.

367

And what is she to do for soldiers?

374

BARRISTAN:
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

375
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,228
Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?

376

378
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:05,109
That means blood on
your hands before the thing is done.

379
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,998
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

380
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:13,388
JORAH: How many wars
have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

381
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:15,470
-Three.
-Have you ever seen a war

382
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,915
where innocents didn't die by the thousands?

383
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,278
lwas in King's Landing
after the sack, Khaleesi.

384
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,396
You know what I saw? Butchery.

385
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,754
Babies, children, old men.

386
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,069
More women raped than you can count.

387
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,551
There's a beast in every man,
and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

388
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,428
But the Unsullied are
not men. They do not rape.

389
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,397
They do not put
cities to the sword unless they're ordered.

390
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:48,836
lfyou buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

391
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,477
You disagree, Ser Barristan?

392
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,358
When your brother
led his army into battle at the Trident,

393
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,829
men died for him
because they believed in him,

394
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,273
because they loved him,

395
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,793
not because they'd been
bought at an auction.

396
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,155
I fought beside the last dragon on that day.

397
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,756
l bled beside him.

398
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,309
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

399
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,072
and Rhaegar died.

400
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,592
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

401
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,116
I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.

402
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,993

But he was not the last dragon.

There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.
Is this what you mean by all?

-But we don't.

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,798
Hard to argue with that.

700

Now that we're speaking together man to man,

701
00:47:23,919 --> 00:47:28,071
lwonder ifyou need
to keep me chained to this tree?

702
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,310
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

703
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:33,515
but if! could sleep lying down,

704

my back would thank you for it.

705

I'm not as young and resilient as l was once.

Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

710
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,350
l'm famished, actually.

711
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:02,237
I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.

712
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,880
Well, I do like partridge.

Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.

715
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,714
Will this work as a table, my lord?

716
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:21,517
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do...

And ifyou get in anytrouble,

724
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,792
all you've got to do is say "my father"

725
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,599
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

726
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:52,548
Don't.

Careful. You don't want
to saythe wrong thing.

You're nothing without your
daddy, and your daddy ain't here.

731
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:12,076
Never forget that.
