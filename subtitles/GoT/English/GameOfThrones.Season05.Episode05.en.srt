00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:25,749
Walda and l have some good news as well,
since we're all together.

363
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,155
We're going to have a baby.

364
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:41,197
I'm very happy foryou.

365
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,477
From the way she's carrying,
Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

366
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,079
RAMSAY: How can you be sure?

367
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,269
Sure of what?

368
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,633
That she's pregnant.

369
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,719

370
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,758
How can you tell?

371
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,388
Maester Wolkan
has assured us beyond all doubt.

372
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,235
So, how did you manage it?

373
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,799
Manage what?

374
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:27,107
Getting her pregnant.

375
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,117
I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

376
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:34,198
Of course, but how did you find it?

377
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,396
You disgraced yourself at dinner,

378
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,156
parading that creature before the Stark girl.

379
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,633
-And if it's a boy?
-(CHUCKLES)

380
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,318
You're worried about your position.

381
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,355
My position is quite clear.

382
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,238
I'm your son

383
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,709
until a better alternative comes along.

384
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,918
You've never asked me about your mother.

385
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,674
Why would I?

386
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,915
She had me, she died.

387
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,513
And here we are.

388
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,431
BOLTON: She was a peasant girl.

389
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,111
Pretty in a common sort of way.

390
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,197
She was the miller's wife.

391
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:27,355
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent,

392
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,714
sol had him hanged,

393
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,272
and I took her
beneath the tree where he was swaying.

394
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,917
She fought me the whole time.

395
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,156
She was lucky I didn't hang her, too.

396
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,668
A year later she came to my gates
with a squalling baby in her arms.

397
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,756
A baby she claimed was mine.

398
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,673
I nearly had herwhipped,

399
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,677
and the child thrown in the river.

400
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,478
But then I looked at you,

401
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,195
and I saw then what I see now.

402
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,238
You are my son.

403
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,151
Stannis Baratheon
has an army at Castle Black,

404
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,350
but he won't stay for long.

405
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,873
He wants the Iron Throne,

406
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:22,235
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

407
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,797
He means to take the North.

408
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:29,390
But the North is ours.

409
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,158
It's yours and mine.

410
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,432
Will you help me defeat him?

411
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:37,788
Yes.

412
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,115
Is this every book there is?

413
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,998
Every bookthere is?

414
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,278

415
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:54,954
Well, no.

416
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,715
There are thousands
and thousands of books out there.

417
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:00,512
This library is rather small, actually.

418
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,476
Where you grew up, were there more books?

419
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,028
My father's not the most literate man.

420

You know how to do
a hundred things I can never do.

427
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,355
You can build a fire with wet wood.

428
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,828
You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

429
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,474
I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

430
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,515
Well...

431
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,875
Why does the Citadel
have the biggest library?

432
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,515
It's where they train the maesters.

433
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,559

434
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,789
I wanted to be one when l was young.

435
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,552
Instead, I became a man ofthe Night's Watch.

436

How?

452
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,997
With a dagger made of dragonglass.

453
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,234
Dragonglass?

454
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,468
What the maesters call obsidian.

455
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,233
I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone.

456
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,072
Why would obsidian kill a Walker?

457
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,751
I don't know.

458
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,273
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

459
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,554
hoping to find something,

460
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,674
and all I've learned

461
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,797
is that the Children ofthe Forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

462
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,236
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

463
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,838
I've seen it, Your Grace.

464
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:21,872
Seen what?

Wouldn't it be better to wait?

472

When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

473
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,272
lf Jon Snow returns with the wildlings.
We can't wait that long.

474
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,875
We have the advantage,
more men, more horses, all fed and rested.

475
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,753
But every day we wait,
the odds shift in Bolton's favour.

476
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,796
This could turn to winter at any moment.

We march at sunrise.

00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,555
and let the rest ofthe city fend for itself.

542
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,314
What do you think?

543
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,158
Your Grace, lam not fit to have
an opinion on these matters.

544
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,390
You are as fit as anyone I know.

545
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,310
You know why I'm here,

546
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:04,072
and who will suffer the most
ifthis all falls apart.

547
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,755
So, what do you think?

548
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,676
I can only tell you what I have seen,
Your Grace.

549
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:15,917
l have seen you listen to your counsellors.

550
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,990
l have seen you lean on their experience
when your own was lacking,

551
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,238
and weigh the choices they put before you.

552
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,751
And l have seen you ignore your counsellors

553
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,714
because there was a better choice.

554
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,711
One that only you could see.

555
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,997
My queen,
please do not do this.

556
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:57,150
What about "Valar Morghulis"?

557
00:43:57,239 --> 00:43:59,594
I did not want to die a coward.

558
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,959
Apparently I do not want to die at all.
(SNIFFLES)

559
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,876
It takes courage to admit fear.

560
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,356
And to admit a mistake.

561
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:18,314
I came here to tell you that l was wrong.

562
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,593
l was wrong, and you were right.

563
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,110
About tradition.

564
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:31,592
About bringing the people
ofthis city together.

565
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:36,631
I will reopen the fighting pits.

566
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,397
To free men only.

567
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:43,268
Slavery will never return to Meereen,
not while I live.

568
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,510
Yes, my queen.

569
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,355
And in orderto forge a lasting bond
with the Meereenese people,

570
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,950
I will marrythe leader of an ancient family.

571
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,907
Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

572
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:28,872
Don't worry.

573
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,111
I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think.

574
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:35,992
Where are we now?

575
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,316
Not the Rhoyne.

576
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:46,348
Long, sullen silences

577
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,193
and an occasional punch in the face.

578
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,515
The Mormont way.

579
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,114
Let's start over.

580
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,828
I apologise for before.

581
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:05,513
My mouth sometimes runs away from me.

582
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:08,075
This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip.

583
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,192
We're going to be spending
a lot oftime together on the way to Meereen.

584
00:46:16,279 --> 00:46:17,234
We are.

585
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,073
What would make our time together
truly enjoyable

586
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:23,478
would be some wine.

587
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,749
No wine.

588
00:46:28,479 --> 00:46:31,789
lam a person who drinks.

589
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:35,834
People who drink need to keep drinking.

590
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,512
Otherwise, they're not...

591
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:46,318
I know where we are.

592
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,516
You're taking us through Valyria.

593
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,114
lam.

594
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,153
TYRION: Have you sailed this route before?

595
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,195
JORAH: No.

596
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,478
You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir

597
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,630
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

598
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,390
I think you'll be plenty.

599
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,231
You know what they say.

600
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,109
The Doom still rules Valyria.

601
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:09,035
What about the demons and the flames?

602
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,072
Aren't you afraid ofthe Doom?

603
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:13,514
JORAH: No.

604
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:16,514
But the pirates are.

605
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:18,114
Oh.

606
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,271
TYRION: The Smoking Sea.

607
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,714
How many centuries before we learn
how to build cities like this again?

608
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,400
For thousands of years, the Valyrians were

609
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,431
the best in the world at almost everything.

610
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:37,638
And then...

611
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,752
And then they weren't.

612
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,392
And then they weren't.

613
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,433
"They held each other close
And turned their backs upon the end

614
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,228
"The hills that split asunder
And the black that ate the skies

615
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,907
"The flames that shot so high and hot
That even dragons burned

616
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,919
"Would never be the final sights
That fell upon their eyes

617
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:06,230
"A fly upon a wall

618
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,994

Whipped and churned"

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,711

"And neither ofthem turned"

00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:24,473
lwould clap.

624
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:32,430
I suppose this is it, then.

625
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:35,910
This is what remains.

You're heavier than you look.

645

Did any ofthem touch you?

646
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,868
You?

647
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,076
I've seen greyscale before.

648
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,349
Nothing like that.

649
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,190
JORAH: I suppose that's why
they send them there.

650
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,470
TYRION: It'd be kinderto put daggers
in their hearts and be done with it.

651
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,039
Thank you for saving me.

652
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:48,308
Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving
ifyou hadn't kidnapped me in the first place.

653
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:54,751
TYRION: So, what now?

654
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:58,514
JORAH: We walk up the coast.
With luck, we'll find a fishing village.

655
00:51:59,439 --> 00:52:00,633
Maybe another boat.

656
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,359
Without luck?

657
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,229
We've got a long walk ahead of us.

658
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:09,988
I'll get some wood for a fire.

659
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,032
Try to get some rest, huh?

660
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,476
That's the best idea you've had all day.
