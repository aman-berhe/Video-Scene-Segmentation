190
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,672
When you marched into the throne room
to tell me

191
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,718
we'd won the Battle of Blackwater,
do you remember?

That's how far I was willing to go

195
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,118
when I thought someone awful
had come to take my son away.

196

killed our mother to come into this world...

Are you really mad enough
to blame him forthat?

232
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,227
He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.

233
