Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

527
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,631
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

528
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,437
What do you think I could do to you?

529
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,556
I never meant to annoy anyone.

530
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,312
But you are. You're annoying me right now.

531
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:25,469
Every breath you draw in my presence
annoys me.

532
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,233
So here's what I want you to do.
Leave my presence.

533
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,719
Leave this wedding right now.

534
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,551
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that

535
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:34,711
all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

536
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,836
Your Grace, Queen Margaery...

537
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,790

the leftovers will feed the dogs,

I don't believe you have met Ellaria.

00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:27,631
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister,

547
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,074
and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent.

548
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,593
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.

549
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,872

Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

We are everywhere in Dorne.

Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

555
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,714
-We don't despise them in Dorne.
-No? How tolerant of you.

556
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,510
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,
giving up your regal responsibilities.

557
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,559
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

558
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,829
I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.

559
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,429
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

Please give him our regards.

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,997
With any luck, the gout will abate with time
and he will be able to walk again.

don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

In some places,
the highborn frown upon those of low birth.

In other places,
the rape and murder of women and children

569
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,797
is considered distasteful.

570
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:35,994
What a fortunate thing for you,
former Queen Regent,

571
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,918

A royal wedding is history.
