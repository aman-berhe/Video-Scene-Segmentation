00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,717
Die forhim ifl must.

184
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,632
And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.

185
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,313
I'm no lady.

186
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,271
What are you doing here?

187
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,919
| live here.

188
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,988
Are you angry with me, brother?

189
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,399
You lying bitch.

190
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,994
It's not my fault you didn't recognise me.

191
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,955
Recognise you? How could I?

192
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,031
The last time I saw you...

193
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,790
you looked like a fat little boy.

194
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,034
You were a fat little boy, too,

195
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,151
but I recognised you.

196
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,913
Why didn't you tell me?

197
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:03,910
I wanted to see who you were first.

198
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,628
(LAUGHS) And I did.

199
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,835
The plans are made. It's time you heard them.

200
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,751
-Father.
-Father.

201
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:17,355
The wolf pup has gone south

202
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,397
with the entirety
ofthe Northern army at his back.

203
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,119
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

204
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,508
the North is ripe forthe taking.

205
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,071
The ironborn will reave and pillage,
as it was in the old days,

206
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,354
all along the northern coast.

207
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:34,158
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

208
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:36,912
securing the Neck and everything above.

209
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,672
Every stronghold will yield to us,
one by one.

210
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,479
Winterfell may defy us for a year,
but what of it?

211
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,197
The rest shall be ours,

212
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,158
forest, field, and hail.

213
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,314
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships

214
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,118
to attack Deepwood Motte.

215
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:58,269
I've always wanted a castle.

216
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,554
And what's my role in all this?

217
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,715
You'll take a ship to raid
the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

218
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,948
Aship?

219
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,396
You give her 30 and | get one?

220
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,631
The Sea Bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.

221
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,427
I'm to fight fishermen?

222
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,475
Be careful oftheir nets.

223
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,354
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

224
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,559
-He won't give up the North so easily.
-They won't even know we're there

225
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,312
-until it's too late.
-What do you know of it, woman?

226
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,718
I'm a proven warrior.

227
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,996
Your brothers were warriors,
both ofthem dead

228
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,355
at the hands ofthose
you seem so eager to protect.

229
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,038
I'm not protecting anyone.

230
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,030
ljust wonder if it's not wiser to wait.

231
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,429
Why risk going against the North
ifthey would be our allies?

232
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,195
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

233
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,589
But ifwe pledge fealty to them,

234
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,433
they'll give us Casterly Rock.

235
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,192
What are ourwords?

236
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,153
Ourwords?

237
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,559
-We do not sow.
-We do not sow.

238
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:06,152
We are ironborn.

239
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,753
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

240
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,760
We do not plough the fields
ortoil in the mine.

241
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,750
We take what is ours.

242
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,919
Yourtime with the wolves
has made you weak.

243
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,194
You act as if I volunteered to go.

244
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,429
You gave me away, ifyou remember.

245
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,749
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

246
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,751
After he crushed you.

247
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,557
Did you take what was yours then?

248
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,958
You gave me away!

249
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:41,433
Your boy!

250
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,718
Your last boy!

251
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,150
You gave me away
like I was some dog you didn't want any more.

252
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,237
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

253
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,230
You'd have our father
bow down to your other family?

254
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,550
l have no other family.

255
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,959
Don't you?

256
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,240
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.

257
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,709
Our ships sail with or without you.

258
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,919
You won't let me leave this room.

259
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,719
-You won't let me...
-(SHUSH|NG) Keep your voice down.

260
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
Why? You think your father can hear me?

261
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,916
He's 300 miles away!

262
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:40,318
(SIGHS)

263
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,908
I don't intend for you to stay here.

264
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,154
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

265
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,550
Again, only temporary.

266
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,869
Every man who has tasted my cooking
has told me what a good whore I am.

267
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,831
But you wouldn't be a cook.

268
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,595
You'd pose as a scullion.

269
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,355
Scullion? What is a scullion?

270
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,912
Kitchen wench.

271
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,758
-A kitchen wench?
-Yes, but...

272
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,798
Cleaning pots?
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

273
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,314
Your lion wants to see you alive.

274
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,516
We've come to a dangerous place.

275
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,396
My sister wants to hurt me.

276
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,356
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

277
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,351
She can't know about you.

278
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,478
I'm the weakness?

279
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,993
It's a compliment, my lady.

280
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,153
How is being a weakness a compliment?

281
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,197
Language can be a bit tricky here.

282
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,349
Oh.

283
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,635
I'm too stupid to understand.

284
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,755
The stupid foreign girl.

285
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,233
lam not a kitchen wench.

286
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,953
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

287
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,110
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

288
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,870
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

289
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,836
and another for the feast.

290
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,192
But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.

291
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,515
The Princess just spoke to you.

292
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,112
Pardon, Your Grace.

293
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,114
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.

294
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,233
l'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

295
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,710
and I can pledge
my love to the king in sight ofthe gods.

296
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,109
ls Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

297
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,319
He might.

298
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,477
Would you like that?

299
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,076
No. I don't think so.

300
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,998
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

301
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,830
Won't you, little dove?

302
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,998
-(KNOCK|NG ON DOOR)
-(GASPS)

303
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,113
Come in.

304
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,829
Who are you?

305
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,514
l'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.

306
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,034
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

307
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,590
-You're not from here.
-No.

308
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,468
What are you doing?

309
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,198
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

310
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,192
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.

311
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,273
What things?

312
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,837
Change my linens, wash my clothing,

313
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,037
scrub the floor,
empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

314
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:15,437
-No.
-You said to brush...

315
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,952
Not now.

316
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,911
Your chamber pot is empty.

317
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,471
Clean the table.

318
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,914
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

319
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,599
-Yes.
-Forwhom?

320
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,511
-Lady Zuriff.
-Lady Zuriff?

321
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,398
Lady Zuriff.

322
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,627
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

323
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:44,991
She wasn't in this city.

324
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,229
I don't know how they did things in that city,

325
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,959
but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,

326
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,519
not the other way around.

327
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,318
And I don't have time
to answer a thousand questions

328
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,629
and teach you how to do yourjob.

329
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,234
Do you want me to leave?

330
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,758
Just brush my hair.

331
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,669
TYRlON: Oh!

332
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,351
Thankthe gods.

333
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,510
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

334
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,390
I've encountered
this problem before, my lord.

335
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,073
The stresses of power often have this

336
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,872
insalubrious effect.

337
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,473
Two drops with water, daily.

338
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,673
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man

339
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,512
of yourvast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

340
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,988
-Please.
-Thank you, my lord.

341
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,712
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

342
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,438
Why, yes, of course, my lord.

343
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,636
These are perilous times.

344
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,630
And the crown must forge new alliances.

345
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:04,950
And these alliances
must often be sealed in matrimony.

346
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,830
Matrimony, huh?

347
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,599
Yes.

348
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:13,634
l'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the Queen mustn't know.

349
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,070
We can't have her meddling in affairs

350
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,879
that could determine the future ofthe realm.
There's too much at stake.

351
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,427
Oh, yes, yes. lndeed, yes.

352
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,989
I shall be silent as the grave.

353
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,430
l'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

354
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,391
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son
when she comes of age,

355
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,912
ensuring their loyalty

356
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,309
and their army, should we need it.

357
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:39,831

-He fights for Robb Stark.
-Precisely.

368

Theon's father loathes the Starks
and will convince the boy to come to our side.

369
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:16,878
Greyjoy can destroy
the Northern army from within

370
