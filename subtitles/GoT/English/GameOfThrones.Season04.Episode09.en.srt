What was she like?

4
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,549
She had red hair.

5
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,435
Oh?

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,910

-What do you want me to say?

7
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:39,514
|want you to tell me
what it was like to have someone.

8
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,307
To be with someone.

9
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,718
To love someone
and have them love you back.

12
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,479
So you and Gilly never?

13
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,915
No. She just had a baby.

14
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,958
And she never offered.

15
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,271
But if she had,

16
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,192
you would have?

17
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,907
You'd have broken your vows?

18
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,187
The interesting thing is,

19
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,671
our vows never specifically forbid
intimate relations with women.

20
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,909
What?

21
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,152
"I shall take no wife."
Yes, that's in there. There's no denying that.

22
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,708
"I shall father no children." It's very specific.

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,313
But what our vows have to say
about other activities

24
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,515
is open to interpretation.

25
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,909
I don't think SerAlliser
cares much for interpretation.

26
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,111
Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret.

27
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,679
We didn't.

ever got to a wildling was this very library.

He didn't listen, and neither did you.

yourwatch atop the Wall

about the terrible things
