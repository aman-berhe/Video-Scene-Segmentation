They're poachers and thieves.

Not soldiers.

186
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,309

as the new Lord Commander...

198
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,395

Roose Bolton.

Hmm. The traitorwho plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

Some ofthe Night's Watch feel you have
too much affection for the wildlings.

224

They were born on the wrong side ofthe Wall.

He can't protect them now.

-Us?

The only reason you're here

281
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:42,358
is because Jaime Lannister
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

from King's Landing.

he already would have.

as he thinks he is,

304

but he's not alone in that castle.

stable boys and serving girls?

No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

No. (CHUCKLES)

to men who disappoint me.

I wouldn't presume to claim
to have known him as such, but...

318

319
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:53,231
to make it so clear

320
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,279
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

321
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,956

Religion has its place, of course,
but at a certain point...

333
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,553
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

334
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,711
I'm sure he'll grow out of it, whatever it is.

-Excuse me.
-Of course.

seem to have healed.

You can forgive me.

What could you possibly have done
to warrant my forgiveness?

341
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,835
I led you into the darkness.

342
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,275
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

343

00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,592
lwill pray foryour father's soul.

356
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,078
(LAUGHS)

357
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,915
The day Tywin Lannister's soul
needs your help...

358
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,307
-OLYVAR: It looks like Dorne.
-LORAS: It doesn't.

359
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:34,388
(OLYVAR LAUGHS)

360
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,673
It does.

361
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:40,273
That's the Sunspear bit, right there.

362
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,833
And that's where the mountains are.

363
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,911
And over here is...

364
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:50,354
Stonespear?

365
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,998
Sandstone.

366
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,478
Yes.

367
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,710
Yes, Sandstone.

368
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,355
Just there.

369
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,028
Fine.

370
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,274
It's Dorne.

371
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,352
We should go there.

372
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,917
I think we would have a lovely time,

373
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,991
judging by my experience.

374
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,034
That would be wonderful.

375
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,595
Dorne, Highgarden.

376
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,757
Anywhere but here.

377
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,958
We're late for dinner as it is.

378
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,349
You're very respectful.

379
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,158
I'm very hungry.

380
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,992
What's your name?

381
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,233
Olyvar, my lady.

382
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,349
I'm afraid my brother
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

383
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,754
My lady.

384
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,395
Perhaps you might consider
being a bit more discreet?

385
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,032
VVhy?

386
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,996
They all know about me anyway.

387
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,312
Everybody knows everything about everyone.

388
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,310
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

389
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,312
In any event,
you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

390
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,632
My intended? Please.

391
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,268
Tywin's dead.

392
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,270
That means no one
can force Cersei to marry me.

393
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,156
-Lucky you.
-Un|ucky you.

394
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,310
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

395
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,955
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

396
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,030
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

397
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,068
Which means you're trapped here
with Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.

398
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,315
Perhaps.

399
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,395
Perhaps?

400
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,477
Perhaps.

401
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:21,028
Eunuch, the spider, the Master ofWhisperers.

402
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,595
Imp, halfman.

403
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,636
There are faster ways to kill yourself.

404
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:29,590
Not for a coward.

405
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,591
You are manythings, my friend,
but not a coward.

406
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,153
You nevertold me why

407
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,308
you set me free.

408
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,391
Your brother asked me to.

409
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,713
Could have said no.

410
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,030
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

411
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,269
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

412
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,755
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

413
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,672
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

414
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,989
I didn't do it for you.

415
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,956
I did it forthe Seven Kingdoms.

416
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,191
A drunken dwarf will never be
the saviour ofthe Seven Kingdoms.

417
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,236
I don't believe in saviours.

418
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,596
I believe men oftalent
have a part to play in the war to come.

419
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,912
You're going to have to find another soldier.

420
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:13,672
I'm done with Westeros,
and Westeros is done with me.

421
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,113
You have many admirable qualities,
self-pity is not one ofthem.

422
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,477
Any fool with a bit of luck
can find himself born into power.

423
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,155
But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

424
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,392
I'm not well-suited for work.

425
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:30,798
lthinkyou are.

426
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
You have your father's instincts for politics,

427
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,635
and you have compassion.

428
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,914
Compassion? Yes.

429
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,157
I killed my loverwith my bare hands.

430
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,992
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

431
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,958
I never said you were perfect.

432
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,751
What is it you want exactly?

433
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,238
Peace.

434
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,558
Prosperity.

435
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:56,837
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

436
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,070
Where the castles are made of gingerbread,

437
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,594
and the moats are filled with blackberry wine.

438
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,950
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

439
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,234
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

440
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,072
Perhaps.

441
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,188
And perhaps we've grown so used to horror,
we assume there's no other way.

442
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,516
lfyou sat on the Iron Throne,

443
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,829
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

444
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,480
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

445
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,232
No, you won't.

446
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,269
But you could help another climb those steps
and take that seat.

447
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,078
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

448
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,354
but gentler than Stannis.

449
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,716
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

450
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:41,595
A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army
and the right family name.

451
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,796
Good luck finding him.

452
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,829
Who said anything about "him"?

453
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,671
You have a choice, my friend.

454
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,276
You can stay here at lllyrio's palace
and drink yourselfto death,

455
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,715
oryou can ride with me to Meereen,
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

456
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,189
and decide ifthe world is worth fighting for.

457
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,394
Can I drink myselfto death
on the road to Meereen?

458
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,079
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

459
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,037
Looks like your friends
haven't been behaving themselves.

460
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:30,637
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

461
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,914
The Wise Masters onunkai
have agreed to cede power

462
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:37,311
to a council of elders made up of both
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

463
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,357
All matters of consequence
will be brought to you for review.

464
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,953
Good.

465
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,518
They did ask for some concessions.

466
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,873
Concessions?

467
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,031
Politics is the art of compromise, Your Grace.

468
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,873
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

469
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,833
HIZDAHR: Forgive me. You're right, of course.

470
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,635
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

471
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,190
DAENERYS:
I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy.

472
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:03,311
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

473
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,233
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

474
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:08,879
They ask for the reopening
ofthe fighting pits.

475
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,313
DAENERYS: The fighting pits?

476
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:13,788
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

477
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,793
In the new world that you've brought to us,
free men would fight free men.

478
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,551
The pit fighters you liberated
plead for this opportunity.

479
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,952
Bring some here and ask them yourself.

480
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,995
No fighting pits.

481
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,474
Opening them would
show the people onunkai and Meereen

482
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,072
that you respect theirtraditions.

483
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,078
I do not respect
the tradition of human cockfighting.

484
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,114
lfyou...

485
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,429
How many times must I say no
before you understand?

486
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,999
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

487
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,389
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

488
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,708
DAARIO: You should reopen the fighting pits.

489
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,591
What?

490
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,068
My mother was a whore.
ltold you that.

491
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,315
She liked to drink pear brandy.

492
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,832
The older she got,

493
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:59,797
the less she made selling her body,
the more she wanted to drink.

494
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,478
So one day when l was 12,

495
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,597
she sold me to a slaver
she fucked the night before.

496
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,518
I'm sorry.

497
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,113
Why? I was a bad child.

498
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:14,835
I wasn't big, but I was quick

499
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,068
and I loved to fight.

500
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,232
So they sold me to a man in Tolos
who trained fighters for the pits.

501
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,675
I had my first match when l was 16.

502
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,352
You were sold into slavery,

503
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,794
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement ofthe masters,

504
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,871
-and you're defending the fighting pits?
-(LAUGHS)

505
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:32,752
I'm only here because ofthose pits.

506
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,034
I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer,

507
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,634
a Norvoshi priest, aWesterosi knight.

508
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,994
Soon I was famous.

509
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,913
Ten thousand men and women screamed
my name when I stepped into the pit.

510
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,788
I made so much money for my master,
he set me free when he died.

511
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,236
ljoined the Second Sons,

512
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,878
and then I met you.

513
00:36:56,759 --> 00:36:58,511
You're the queen.

514
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,909
Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth.

515
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,309
Everyone but me.

516
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,350
You've made thousands of enemies
all across the world.

517
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:09,953
As soon as they see weakness,

518
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,678
they'll attack.

519
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,396
Show your strength here, now.

520
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,674
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

521
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,909
(SCOFFS)

522
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,151
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

523
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,193
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

524
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,679
You're the Mother of Dragons.

525
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:39,313
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

526
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,548
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

527
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:45,433
For all I know,
he's flown halfway across the world.

528
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,917
I can't control them any more.

is not a queen.

When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

And now, for our last meeting...

543
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,395
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

No, but it will be.

00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:24,474
You know what Stannis wants?

546
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,949
He wants me to bend the knee.

547
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,235
And he wants the free folk to fight for him.

548
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:33,272
I'll give him this much, he's bold.

549
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,957
Shouldn't a king be bold?

550
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,793
Oh, aye.

551
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,912
I respect him.

If he gets what he wants,
I expect he'll be a better ruler

But I'll never serve him.

555
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,032
You told me you weren't here to conquer.

556

You told me your people have bled enough.

You didn't do it for power.
You didn't do it for glory.

You brought them together to save them

00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,672
because none ofthem will survive the winter,
not ifthey're north ofthe Wall.

Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

This isn't about that.

Then bend the knee and save your people.

They followed me because they respected me.

572
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,071
Because they believed in me.

00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,309

that's all gone.

And you won't go out
and rescue them because why?

Bad way to go.

585
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,711

And burned to death?

I don't want people to remember me like that,
scorched and screaming.

But it's betterthan
betraying everything I believe.
