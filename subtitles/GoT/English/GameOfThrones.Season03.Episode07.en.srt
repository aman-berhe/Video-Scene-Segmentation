the King's Road.

banging drums and waving banners?

Is that a great honour, too?

banging the drums.

So, what good are they?

17

and we hit Castle Black,

Do you see her sulking about it?

33

That's because
she understands the way things are.

Well, the Tower ofthe Hand is where | work.

Apparently so.

Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,675
When I was Hand of
the King underyour father's predecessor,

247
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,389
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.

248
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,875
The skull ofthe last ofthem was right here.

249
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,951
It was the size of an apple.

250
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,317
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

251
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,235
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.

Curiosities on
the far side ofthe world are no threat to us.

253
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,156
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:50,151
and not the beasts
that brought the whole world to heel?

255
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,958
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

257
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,956

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,753
Well?

534
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,957
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

535
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,673
(GROANS)

536
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,199
Everyone knows you love girls.

537
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,951
I bet you always thought they loved you back.

538
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,117
(GRUNTING)

539
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,429
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

540
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,556
Would you say it's your most precious part?

541

No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!

545
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,036
This is mercy.

546
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,878
I'm not killing you.

547
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,510

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,835
(WHISPERS) I'm
not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.

552
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,028
It's too far away.

553
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,879

lt'sawindmill.

555
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,389
Who built it? Some king?

556
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:33,276
Just the men who used to live here.

557
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,272
YGRITTE: They must have
been great builders, stacking stones so high.

558
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,678
Winterfell has towers three times that size.

559
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,069
"Oh, I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell.

560

564
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,079
What's swooning?

565
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:54,798
Fainting.

566
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,039
What's fainting?

567
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,911
When a girl sees blood and collapses.

568
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,792
Why would a girl see blood and collapse?

569
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,949
Well...

570
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,472
Not all girls are like you.

571
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,949
(CHUCKLES)

572
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,996
Well, girls see more blood than boys.

573
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,912
Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?

574
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,318
(GASPS) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.

575
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:24,995
My dress is made
ofthe purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.

576
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,797
I'd like to see you in a silk dress.

577
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,628
Would you?

578
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,877
So I could tear it off you.

579
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,992
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress, l'll blacken your eye.

580
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,116
Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.

581
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,270
Or maybe one day I'll take you there.

582
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:56,629
After we've taken our land back.

583
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,189

You won't win.

585
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,115
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

586
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,598
You know nothing...

587
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,113
Six times in the last thousand years,

588
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,633
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

589
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,199
Six times they failed.

590
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,799
And how do you know that?

591
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,350
Every boy in
the North knows it. We grow up learning it.

592
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,112
Where the battles
were fought, the heroes, who died where.

593
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,750
Sixtimes you've invaded
and six times you've failed.

594
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,153
The seventh will be the same.

595
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,673
Mance is different.

596
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,238
You don't have the discipline.

597
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,710
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

598
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:39,994
You don't know how to fight together.

599
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,115
You don't knowthat.

600
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,348
I do.

601
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,553
I know it.

602
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,348
lfyou attackthe Wall, you'll die. All of you.

603
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,998
All of us.

604
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,035
You're mine as I'm yours.

605
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:20,394
And ifwe die, we die.

606
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,158
But first we'll live.

607
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,354
Yes, first we'll live.

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,872
What's he going on about?

610
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,839
And how come he always gets to sit and
chat while we do all the work?

611
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,473
Hodor.

612
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:57,798
-That's where we are.
-What are you telling him?

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,272
-|t's all right, Osha.
-|t's not all right.

614
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,954
You think I can't hear you every day?

615
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,354
Filling his head with black magic.

616
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,554
Talking about visions
and three-eyed ravens and worse.

617
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,754
Leave him alone.

618
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,318
He can speak for himself.

619
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,273
I don't fill his head with anything.

620
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,032
OSHA: So, what do you talk about?

621
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:17,472
What's happening to him
and what that means.

622
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,676
Go on, then. Tell us what it means.

623
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,519
It's not like that.

624
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:24,910
lwish I could tell
him all the answers. It would be much easier.

625
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,872
I don't want you talking to him any more.

626
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:29,796
Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.

627
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,154
We're not going to Castle Black.

628
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:32,593
What did you say?

629
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,275
I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.

630
00:43:35,399 --> 00:43:37,754
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.

631
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,068
Oh, no. I'm not going backthere.

632
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,957
Your brother is
at Castle Black. That's where we're going.

633
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,712
Look at me.

634
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,074
The raven's been coming
to me ever since I fell from that tower.

635
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:53,195
He wants me to find him.

636
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:56,269
I don't have my legs any more.

637
00:43:57,479 --> 00:43:58,958
This is what I have now.

638
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,919
You have a family.
You need to go back to Castle Black

639
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,468
so you can get back to
them, where you belong.

640
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,437
What if! belong in the North?

641
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,559
What if! fell from that tower for a reason?

642
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,430
Is that what he's
telling you? That it's all for a reason?

643
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,953
All these bad things happened because the
Gods got big plans foryou?

644
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:22,833
lwish it were true, little lord.

645
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:26,798
But the Gods wouldn't spare
a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.

646
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,030
You don't understand. You don't know.

647
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,997
You don't know. None of you know.

648
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,997
None of you have been up there.

649
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:40,038
I had a man once. A good man.

650
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,272
Bruni, his name was.
I was his and he was mine.

651
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,152
But one night Bruni disappears.

652
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,549
People said he left me, but I knew him.

653
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,029
He'd never leave me. Not for long.

654
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,552
I knew he'd come back.

655
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,435
And he did.

656
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,113
He came in through the back ofthe hut.

657
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,716
Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.

658
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:16,359
His skin was pale like a dead man's.

659
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:19,788
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

660
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,073
He came at me,
grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard

661
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,434
I could feel the life slipping out of me.

662
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,718
I don't know how I got the knife.

663
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:42,308
When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.

664
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,877
And he hardly seemed to notice.

665
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,589
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.

666
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:58,839
I didn't ask the Gods what it meant.

667
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:01,559
I didn't need to. I already knew.

668
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:07,355
It meant the North was
no place for men to be. Not any more.

669
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,354
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.

670
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,079
QYBURN: How is the pain, my lord?

671
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,918
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?

672
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,474
Well, we've stymied the corruption.

673
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,390
Yes, we've stymied the corruption.

674
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:40,758
You're a learned man.

675
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,632
All the good it's done me.

676
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,516
You did well sewing up this mess.

677
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,559
You're far better at this sort of
work than Grand Maester Pycelle.

678
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,757
Faint praise, my lord.

679
00:46:53,919 --> 00:46:56,308
So, why did the Citadel take your chain?

680
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,758
Did you fondle one boy too many?

681
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,673
No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

682
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:04,878
What is?

683
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,313
Curiosity.

684
00:47:09,399 --> 00:47:12,596
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease,

685
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,272
and the only way
to understand it is to study the afflicted.

686
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:19,995
You performed experiments on living men.

687
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,957
-On dying men.
-With their permission?

688
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:26,351
My studies have
given me insight that has saved many lives.

689
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:31,229
Dying paupers, I assume.
Men with no families to complain.

690
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,596
You found them moaning in the poorhouse

691
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,790
and had them carted back to your garret

692
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,757
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

693
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:41,556
How many men have you killed, my lord?

694
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:44,478
-I don't know.
-50?

695
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,679
100?

696
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,595
Countless.

697
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:52,192
"Countless" has a nice ring to it.

698
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,998
And how many lives have you saved?

699
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,273
Halfamillion.

700
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:00,357
The population of King's Landing.

701
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,147
You were in charge ofthe ravens at Harrenhal.

702
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,838
Did you... Did you
get a bird offto Brienne's father in Tarth?

703
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:15,638
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.

704
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,955
Lord Selwyn Tarth

705
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,828
offered 300 gold dragons
