1
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,113
(Gate rumbling, chains rattling)

2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,156
(Horse snorbs)

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,397
(Rumbling, chain rattling)

4
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,717
(Wind whistling)

5
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,789
- Easy, boy.
- (Grunts)

6
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,796
(Horse whinnies)

7
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,755
(Man) What do you expect?
They're savages.

8
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,110
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

9
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,515
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pimes.

10
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,948
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

11
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,196
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

12
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,389
- (Horse snorts)
- How close did you get?

13
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,756
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.

14
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,679
Do the dead frighten you?

15
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,876
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

16
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,036
We tracked them.
They won‘t trouble us no more.

17
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,514
You don‘t think he'll ask us how they died?

18
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,397
Get back on your horse.

19
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,676
(Sighs, mutters)

20
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,313
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

21
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,958
They even killed the children.

22
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,751
It's a good thing we're not children.

23
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,798
You want to run away south,
run away.

24
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,718
Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.

25
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,831
If I don't catch you ﬁrst.

26
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,350
Get back on your horse.

27
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,675
I won't say it again.

28
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,675
(Shrill animal coll)

29
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,953
Your dead men seem
to have moved comp.

30
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,192
They were here.

31
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,032
See where they went.

32
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,400
(Echoing creature cries)

33
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,436
What is it?

34
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,755
It's...

35
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,597
(Cracking, creaking)

36
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,831
(Distant scream)

37
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,029
(Horses neighing)

38
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,798
(Galloping hooves)

39
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,354
(Snarling)

40
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,478
(Chi‘ttering)

41
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,156
(Coughing)

42
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,678
(Coughing)

43
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,711
(Panting)

44
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,512
(Laboured breathing)

45
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,312

46
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,272
(GBSPS)

47
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,473

48
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,157

49
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,230
(Galloping hooves)

50
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,353
(stamps)

51
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,228
Go on, Father's watching.

52
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:31,951
And your mother.

53
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,071
Fine work. as always.
Well done.

54
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,838
Thank you.

55
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,629
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these comers.

56
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,472
Quite beautiful.

57
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,397
The stitching...

58
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,590
Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...

59
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,119
(Arrows impacting, men laughing)

60
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,157
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

61
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,990
(Arrow impacting)

62
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,595
- (Sighs)
- (Laughing)

63
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,318
And which one of you
was a marksman at ten?

64
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,753
Keep practicing, Bran.

65
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,716
Go on.

66
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,400
Don't think too much, Bran.

67
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,835
Relax your bow arm.

68
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,311
(Men laughing)

69
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,879
- Quick Branl
- Faster.

70
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,311
Lord Starkl

71
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,269
My lady.

72
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,396
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.

73
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,398
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

74
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,629
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

75
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,597
Do you have to?

76
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,711
He swore an oath, Cat.

77
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,751
Law is law, my lady.

78
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,711
Tell Bran he's coming too.

79
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,072
Ned.

80
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,395
Ten is too young
to see such things.

81
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,999
He won't be a boy forever.

82
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,512
And winter is coming.

83
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,995
Good lad, go run back and get the rest.

84
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,392
White walkers.

85
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,113
I saw the white walkers.

86
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,036
White walkers.

87
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,071
The white walkers, I saw them.

88
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:54,757
(Exhales)

89
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,077
I know I broke my oath.

90
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,672
And I know I'm a deserter.

91
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,079
I should have gone back to the Wall
and warned them, but...

92
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,111
lsawwhatlsaw.

93
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,718
I saw the white walkers.

94
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,318
People need to know.

95
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,157
If you can get word to my family...

96
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,515
tell them I'm no coward.

97
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,517
Tell them I'm sorry.

98
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,432
(Whispers) Forgive me, Lord.

99
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,710
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

100
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,710
- the ﬁrst of his name...
- Don't look away.

101
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,552
- ..King of the Andals and the First Men...
- Father will know if you do.

102
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,870
..Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

103
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,753
l, Eddard of the House Stark.

104
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,268
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North,

105
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,788
sentence you to die.

106
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,558
You did well.

107
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,033
You understand why I did it?

108
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,957
Jon said he was a deserter.

109
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,514
But do you understand
why I had to kill him?

110
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,152
"Our way is the old way"?

111
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,274
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

112
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,554
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

113
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,358
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

114
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,919
So he was lying?

115
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:18,429
A madman sees what he sees.

116
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,151
What is it?

117
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,038
Mountain lion?

118
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,595
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

119
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,351
(Pup whines)

120
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,598
It's a freak

121
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,148
It's a direwolf.

122
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,189
Tough old beast.

123
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,390
There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.

124
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,467
Now there are ﬁve.

125
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,632
You want to hold it?

126
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,115
(Pup whimpers)

127
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,432
(Bran) Where will they go?

128
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,198
Their mother's dead.

129
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,798
They don't belong down here.

130
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,549
Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.

131
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,590
- Right. Give it here.
- Nol

132
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,311
- (Whimpers)
- Put away your blade.

133
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,237
- I take orders from your father, not you.
- Please, Fatherl

134
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,077
I'm sorry, Bran.

135
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,188
Lord Stark?

136
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,671
One for each of the Stark children.

137
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,188
- (Pup cries)
- The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

138
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,635
They were meant to have them.

139
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,750
You will train them yourselves.

140
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,677
You will feed them yourselves.

141
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,552
And ifthey die, you will bury them yourselves.

142
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:58,477
What about you?

143
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,911
I'm not a Stark.

144
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,031
Get on.

145
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,750
(Whimpering)

146
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,079
What is it?

147
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,475
The runt of the litter.
That one's yours, Snow.

148
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,672
(Bells tolling)

149
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,237
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...

150
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,311
you worry too much.

151
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,671
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

152
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,674
When we were seven and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock.

153
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,952
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

154
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,639
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

155
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,189
(Mimics) 'We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."

156
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:49,915
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

157
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,269
My husband.

158
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,995
If he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

159
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,511
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

160
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,077
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

161
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,630
someone to do his job while he's off
flicking boars and hunting whores.

162
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,397
Or is it the other way around?

163
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,110
And life will go on.

164
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,708
You should be the Hand of the King.

165
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,272
That's an honour I can do without.

166
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:18,957
Their days are too long,

167
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,717
their lives are too short.

168
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,637
(Thunder rumbles)

169
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,955
(OEWS)

170
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,357
(Birds chirping)

171
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,748
All these years,

172
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,911
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

173
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,238
You have ﬁve northern children.

174
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,670
You're not an outsider.

175
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,155
I wonder ifthe old gods agree.

176
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,152
It's your gods with all the rules.

177
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,915
I am so sorry, my love.

178
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:28,435
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

179
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,958
Jon Arryn is dead.

180
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,513
A fever took him.

181
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,349
I know he was like a father to you.

182
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,238
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

183
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,270
gods be good.

184
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,394
The raven brought more news.

185
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,709
The king rides for Winterfell...

186
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:06,392
with the queen and all the rest of them.

187
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,510
If he's coming this far north...

188
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,997
there's only one thing he's after.

189
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,310
You can always say no, Ned.

190
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,869
(Catelyn) We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

191
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,595
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

192
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:34,756
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

193
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,358
stature?

194
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:39,232
We've brought up eight barrels of ale
from the cellar.

195
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,508
Perhaps we'll ﬁnd out.

196
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:42,391
In any case, candles.

197
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,078
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

198
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,839
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink

199
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,915
I hear the prince is a right royal prick

200
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,349
Think of all those southem girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick

201
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,236
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

202
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,555
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

203
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,317
(Laughter)

204
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,599
- (PUP YBPS)
- Gods, but they grow fast.

205
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,392
Brandonl

206
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,397
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

207
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,432
But he's coming right now, down our road.

208
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,469
I want you to promise me,

209
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,157
no more climbing.

210
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,908
I promise.

211
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,952
- Do you know what?
- What?

212
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,195
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

213
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,151
(Chuckles)

214
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,952
Run and ﬁnd your father.

215
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,035
Tell him the king is close.

216
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,875
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

217
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,795
- HEY. he! he! he!-
- Oh.

218
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,751
What are you doing with that on?

219
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,110
- Go on.
- (Groans)

220
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,032
(AWE) Movel

221
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,911
(Neighs)

222
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,557
Your Grace.

223
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:59,517
You've got fat.

224
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,472
(Laughter)

225
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,552
- Catl
- Your Grace.

226
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,829
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

227
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:23,349
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

228
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,553
- Where's the lmp?
- Will you shut up?

229
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,112
(Robert) Who have we here?

230
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,714
You must be Robb.

231
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,596
My, you're a pretty one.

232
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:41,790
Your name is?

233
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,198
Arya.

234
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,828
Oh, show us your muscles.

235
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,314
(Chuckles) You'll be a soldier.

236
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,388
(Arya) That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

237
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,556
(Sansa) Would you please shut up?

238
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,714
My queen.

239
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,433
My queen.

240
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,510
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

241
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,351
We've been riding for a month, my love.

242
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,397
Surely the dead can wait.

243
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,316
Ned.

244
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,748
Where's the lmp?

245
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,031
(Queen) Where is our brother?

246
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,718
Go and ﬁnd the little beast.

247
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,712
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

248
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,036
One minute he was ﬁne and then...

249
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,833
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

250
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,870
I loved that man.

251
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,274
We both did.

252
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:55,551
(Robert) He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

253
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,432
- (Chuckles)
- All I wanted to do

254
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,074
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

255
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,192
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

256
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,834
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

257
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,711
(Both laugh)

258
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,032
(Sighs)

259
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,156
I need you, Ned,

260
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,795
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

261
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,317
Lord Eddard Stark...

262
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,548
I would name you the Hand of the King.

263
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,915
I'm not worthy of the honour.

264
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,393
I'm not trying to honour you.

265
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,111
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

266
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:35,834
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

267
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,716
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

268
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,077
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

269
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,760
now help me keep the damn thing.

270
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,195
We were meant to rule together.

271
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,994
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

272
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,399
Well, it's not too late.

273
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,632
l have a son,
you have a daughter.

274
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,957
We'll join our houses.

275
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,718
(Woman moaning)

276
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,189
(Sighs)

277
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:22,995
(Cup falls)

278
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:25,952
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

279
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,148
(Giggles)

280
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:36,109
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

281
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,797
I did hear something about that.

282
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,990
And the queen and her twin brother.

283
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:43,031
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

284
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,951
And the other brother?

285
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,112
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

286
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,912
and there's the clever one.

287
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,599


288
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:55,869
I hear they call him the lmp.

289
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,712
I hear he hates that nickname.

290
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,110
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

291
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:03,355
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

292
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,868
prone to all manner of perversions.

293
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,717
Clever girl.

294
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,118
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

295
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,919
Have you?

296
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,393
- Already?
- Ohl

297
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,760
- The gods gave me one blessing.
- (Laughs)

298
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,915
(Door opens)

299
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,874
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

300
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,515
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

301
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,596
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

302
00:30:33,719 --> 00:30:36,711
but our sister craves your attention.

303
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,351
She has odd cravings, our sister.

304
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:41,435
A family trait.

305
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,874
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

306
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:48,627
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

307
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,990
And this is the ﬁrst of many courses.

308
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,195
I thought you might say that.

309
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,834
But since we're short on time...

310
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,187
Come on, girls.

311
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,833
(Giaalina)

312
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,638
See you at sundown.

313
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,750
(T yrion) Close the doorl

314
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:22,313
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

315
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,235
She should be on a hill somewhere

316
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,594
with the sun and the clouds above her.

317
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,675
She was my sister.

318
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,392
This is where she belongs.

319
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,750
She belonged with me.

320
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,071
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

321
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,672
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

322
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,872
(Gull crying)

323
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,956
(Man) Daenerysl

324
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,638
Daenerys.

325
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,671
There's our bride-to-be.

326
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,108
Look a gift from lllyrio.

327
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:20,197
Touch it.

328
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,395
Go on, feel the fabric.

329
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,074


330
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,912
Isn't he a gracious host?

331
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,675
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

332
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,596
lllyrio's no fool.

333
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,437
He knows I won't forget my ﬁiends

334
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,710
when I come into my throne.

335
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,551
You still slouch.

336
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,955
Let them see.

337
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,279
You have a woman's body now.

338
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,758
(Sighs)

339
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:21,350
I need you to be perfect today.

340
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,118
Can you do that for me?

341
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,988
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

342
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:33,868
No.

343
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,187
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

344
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,197
they will say it began today.

345
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,517
It's too hot, my lady.

346
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,797
(Gulls crying)

347
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,756
Where is he?

348
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,638
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

349
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:51,318
(lllyrio) Athchomar chomaloaan, Khal vezhven.

350
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:53,270
May I present my honoured guests?

351
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,755
Viserys of House Targaryen,

352
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,352
the third of his name,

353
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:01,715
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

354
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,068
and his sister,

355
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,952
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

356
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,751
(Speaking Dothraki)

357
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,155
Do you see how long his hair is?

358
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,959
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

359
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,550
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

360
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,348
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

361
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,428
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the ﬁnest killers alive.

362
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,836
And you will be his queen.

363
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,352
Come forward, my dear.

364
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,955
Where is he going?

365
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,640
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

366
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,869
Did he like her?

367
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:19,594
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

368
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,715
(lllyrio) It won't be long now.

369
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,355
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

370
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,228
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

371
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,675
They cry out for their true king.

372
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,910
When will they be married?

373
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,389
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

374
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,710
Is it true they lie with their horses?

375
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:49,589
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

376
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,756
Do you take me for a fool?

377
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,518
I take you for a king.

378
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,631
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

379
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,398
My apologies if I've given offence.

380
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,033
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

381
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,839
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

382
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,670
I don't want to be his queen.

383
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,834
I want to go home.

384
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,747
Sodol.

385
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,075
I want us both to go home,

386
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:20,309
but they took it from us.

387
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:22,191
So tell me, sweet sister,

388
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,871
how do we go home?

389
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,595
I don't know.

390
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,869
We go home with an army.

391
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,075
With Khal Drogo's army.

392
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:38,117
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

393
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,197
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

394
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,918
if that's what it took.

395
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:51,352
(Kisses)

396
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,915
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

397
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,155
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

398
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,556
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

399
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,394
He's so handsome.

400
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,114
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

401
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:18,197
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

402
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,912
Why would he say no?

403
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,838
He'd be the swond most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

404
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,915
He'd have to leave home.

405
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,434
He'd have to leave me.

406
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,435
And so would you.

407
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,789
You left your home to come here.

408
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:35,591
And I'd be queen someday.

409
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,958
Please make Father say yesl

410
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,798
- Sansa...
- Please, pleasel

411
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,672
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

412
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,556
(Music playing, people chattering)

413
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,397
(Laughter)

414
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,035
Fill that upl
Boys, Rodrik come on.

415
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,155
Come onl

416
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,874
Come here, you little beautyl

417
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,632
(Robert laughing)

418
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,308
Is he dead yet?

419
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,595
Uncle Benjen.

420
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:29,351
(Laughs)

421
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,628
You got bigger.

422
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,472
Rode all day.

423
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:36,073
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

424
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,427
Why aren't you at the feast?

425
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,239
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

426
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,151
to seat a bastard in their midst.

427
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:45,274
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

428
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:47,276
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

429
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,991
So take me with you
when you go back

430
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,878
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

431
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,711
I know he will.

432
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,351
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

433
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:01,033
I'm ready to swear your oath.

434
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:04,151
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

435
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:06,116
We have no families.

436
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:09,794
- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.

437
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:12,752
You might, if you knew what it meant.

438
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,348
(Sighs) I'd better get inside,

439
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,630
rescue your father from his guests.

440
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,516
We'll talk later.

441
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,834
(T yrion) Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

442
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,914
What are you doing back there?

443
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,196
Preparing for a night with your family.

444
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,031
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

445
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,877
You're Tyr'ion Lannister,

446
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:53,432
the queen's brother?

447
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,158
My greatest awomplishment.

448
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,193
And you, you're Ned Starks bastard,
aren't you?

449
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,596
Did I offend you? Sorry.

450
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,028
You are the bastard, though.

451
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,475
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

452
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,193
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

453
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,198
making you...the bastard.

454
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,147
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

455
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,992
Never forget what you are.

456
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,395
The rest of the world will not.

457
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,999
Wear it like armour...

458
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:32,989
and it can never be used to hurt you.

459
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,154
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

460
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,868
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

461
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,319
(Music playing, chattering)

462
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,998
(Laughter)

463
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,197
You at a feast...

464
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,758
it's like a bear in a trap.

465
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,159
The boy | beheaded...

466
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:14,232
- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

467
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,390
But he was tough, Ned,

468
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,674
a true ranger.

469
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:20,278
(Scoﬁs)

470
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,078
He was talking madness.

471
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,917
Said the walkers slaughtered his ﬁiends.

472
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,190
The two he was with are still missing.

473
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,116
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

474
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,115
Maybe.

475
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,793
Direwolves south of the Wall,

476
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:40,035
talk of the walkers,

477
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,593
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

478
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:45,511
Winter is coming.

479
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,792
Winter is coming.

480
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,279
(They chuckle)

481
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:53,118
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

482
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,639
- How are you?
- I'm good.

483
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,916
(Laughter)

484
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,599
Is this your ﬁrst time
in the North, Your Grace?

485
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:03,392
Yes. Lovely country.

486
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:10,196
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

487
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:15,637
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the ﬁrst time.

488
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,279
Hello, little dove.

489
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,310
But you are a beauty.

490
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,635
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, Your Grace.

491
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,228
You're tall. Still growing?

492
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,117
I think so, Your Grace.

493
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,276
And have you bled yet?

494
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,598
No, Your Grace.

495
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,597
Your dress, did you make it?

496
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,437
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

497
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,192
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

498
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,314
I hear the same.

499
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:54,555
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

500
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:57,876
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

501
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:16,713
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbours soon.

502
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,116
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honoured me with his offer.

503
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,352
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

504
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,471
It would be good
to have you on the ﬁeld.

505
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,830
The competition has bmome a bit stale.

506
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,149
- I don't ﬁght in tournaments.
- No?

507
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,713
Getting a little old for it?

508
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,518
(Chuckles)

509
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,555
I don't ﬁght in tournaments

510
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:37,994
bwause when I ﬁght a man for real,

511
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,792
I don't want him to know what I can do.

512
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:43,318
Well said.

513
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:45,913
- (Laughing)
- Aryal

514
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:49,797
It's not funnyl

515
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,440
She always does this.

516
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,869
This was my favourite dress
and she ruined it

517
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,354
She always does it
and it's not funnyl

518
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,232
(Robb) Time for bed.

519
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,192
(Arya groans)

520
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,472
(Ned) I'm a Northman.

521
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,437
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats' nest they call a capital.

522
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:21,078
I won't let him take you.

523
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,034
The king takes what he wants.

524
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,309
(Snorts) That's why he's king.

525
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,869
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

526
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:32,988
(He laughs)

527
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,072
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

528
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:38,036
"He belongs to me now."

529
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,595
How did he get so fat?

530
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:47,871
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink (Chuckles)

531
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,273
(Knocking)

532
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:51,754
(Man) It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

533
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,997
Send him in.

534
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:59,434
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

535
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,914
A rider in the night...

536
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,156
from your sister.

537
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,079
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

538
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:15,791
(Door closes)

539
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,956
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

540
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,548
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

541
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:34,436
(Ned) What news?

542
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,349
(Catelyn) She's ﬂed the capital.

543
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,028
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

544
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:44,956
By the Lannisters.

545
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,674
She says the king is in danger.

546
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,910
She's fresh widowed, Oat.

547
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,598
She doesn't know what she's saying.

548
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:56,793
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
ifthe wrong people had found that letter.

549
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:59,035
Do you think she would risk her life,

550
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:00,638
her son's life,

551
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,036
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

552
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:12,716
If this news is true...

553
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,276
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

554
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:18,674
who but you can protect the king?

555
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,950
They murdered the last Hand.

556
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,236
Now you want Ned to take the job?

557
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,074
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Starks help.

558
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:29,548
He's the only one he trusts.

559
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,753
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

560
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,276
He's spent half his life
ﬁghting Robert's wars.

561
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,351
He owes him nothing.

562
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,276
Your father and brother
rode south once

563
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,874
on a king's demand.

564
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:50,755
A different time.

565
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,070
A different king.

566
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:59,396
- (Noisy chatter)
- (Drumming)

567
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,711
(Hissing)

568
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:28,590
(Gasps)

569
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:56,115
When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

570
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,516
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it

571
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:02,551
- When?
- When their omens favour war.

572
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:06,073
I piss on Dothraki omens.

573
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:08,759
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back

574
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,598
- (Crowd ululating)
- (Grunting)

575
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,748
(Cheering)

576
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:46,876
Etayo akloa.

577
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:48,398
(Blades clang)

578
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:58,833
(Screams)

579
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:10,989
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull affair.

580
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,515
(Laughing)

581
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,111
Jadi, zhey Jorah andahlil

582
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:26,957
Khal vezhven.

583
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:35,351
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

584
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:38,747
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

585
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:41,678
Thank you, ser.

586
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,920
Are you from my country?

587
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:47,995
Ser Jorah Morrnont of Bear Island.

588
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,713
I served your father for many years.

589
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,673
Gods be good, I hope to
always serve the rightful king.

590
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:18,519
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

591
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:21,233
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

592
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,153
The ages have turned them to stone,

593
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,197
but they will always be beautiful.

594
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:29,917
Thank you, Magister.

595
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:37,755
She's beautiful.

596
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,033
Ser Jorah, I...

597
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,793
I don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

598
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,593
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

599
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,796
Make him happy.

600
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,438
(Waves crashing)

601
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,671
- No.
- (Sober)

602
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,632
Do you know the common tongue?

603
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,918
- (Pin clanks)
- No.

604
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:27,115
Is "no" the only word that you known

605
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,834
No.

606
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,230
(Continues sobbing)

607
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,996
Rough night, Imp?

608
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,997
If I get through this without squirting

609
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,873
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

610
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:05,717
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

611
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,798
The greatest in the land -
my spear never misses.

612
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,716
It's not hunting if you pay for it

613
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,356
Are youasgood withaspear
asyouusedtobe?

614
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,835
No, but I'm still better than you.

615
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,678
(Laughs)

616
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:29,232
I know what I'm putting you through.

617
00:55:29,399 --> 00:55:30,991
Thank you for saying yes.

618
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,235
I only ask you bwause I need you.

619
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,834
You're a loyal ﬁiend. You hear me?

620
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,398
A loyal ﬁiend.

621
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,112
The last one I've got.

622
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,870
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

623
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:51,191
And I'll make sure you don't look
so flicking grim all the time.

624
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,630
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boarl

625
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,839
Come on, you.

626
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:21,598
(Whines)

627
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,639
(Grunts)

628
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,196
(Barks softly)

629
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,998
(Woman gasping)

630
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,671
(Woman moaning)

631
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:01,997
(Grunting, moaning)

632
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,958
(Gasps)

633
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,759
- Stopl Stop.
- (Gasm)

634
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,635
Are you completely mad?

635
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:31,114
- He saw us.
- It's all ﬁght, it's all right.

636
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,195
- It's all right.
- He saw usl

637
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,389
I heard you the ﬁrst time.

638
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,039
(Whimpers)

639
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,512
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

640
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,432
- How old are you, boy?
- Ten.

641
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:47,117
Ten.

642
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,829
- The things I do for love.
- (Gasm)
