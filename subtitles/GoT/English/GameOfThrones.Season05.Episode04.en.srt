How do we pay them?

57
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,116
Well, House Tyrell could front the gold,
and the crown would pay us back in time,

58

00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,597
MAN 1: Bastard!

180
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,674
MAN 2: You're an abomination!

181
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,592
MAN 3: Born of sin!

182
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,838
WOMAN: Filthy bastard!

183
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,232
We'll find anotherway.

184
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,112
MAN 4: Abomination!

185
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,154
My queen?

186
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,709
There was no way
to free Ser Loras without violence.

187
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,589
You're the King ofthe Andals,

188
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,149
the Lord ofthe Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector ofthe Realm,

189
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,231
and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother-by-law.

190
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,267
I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.

191
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,077
Are you? When?

192
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,154
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

193
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,435
He was praying just now.

194
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,078
l have to send word to Grandmother.

195
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,799
Will you come back later?

196
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,396
I need to be with my family, Your Grace.

197
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:09,352
Of course.

198
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,068
(GRUNTING)

199
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,917
SELYSE: You think highly ofthis boy?

200
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,349
Good.

201
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,759
STANNIS: Lord Commander
ofthe Night's Watch.

202
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,952
And a bastard by some tavern slut.

203
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,679
Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

204
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,312
I should have given you a son.

205
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:31,638
Not your fault.

206
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,073
Whose, then?

207
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,070
I gave you nothing but weakness

208
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,074
and deformity.

209
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,078
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

210
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,512
My lady.

211
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:48,628
Her father is the Lord's chosen king,

212
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,109
and her father's blood runs through herveins.

213
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,155
You march on Winterfell soon?

214
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,356
We must to beat the snows.

215
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,871
Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos
and left me behind.

216
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,231
I hope you won't make that mistake again.

217
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,468
lwon't.

218
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,953
I need you.

219
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,270
You only need faith, my king.

220
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,437
And you. What do you need?

221
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,032
To serve my Lord.

222
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,388
(GRUNTING)

223
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,112
Lord Ashford.

224
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,632
Lady Caulfield.

225
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,799
Lord Smallwood.

226
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,879
I've never even heard ofthese people.

227
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,757
They haven't heard of you, either.

228
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,629
But we need men, and they have some.

229
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,798
How many men does this Lord Mayzen
have to send us?

230
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,154
More than Lord Wibberley.

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,150
-Not him.
-I know. I'm sorry.

232
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,831
But we need men and supplies,

233
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,912
and Roose Bolton's the Warden ofthe North.

234
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,068
He murdered my brother.

235
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:27,798
We swore to be the watchers on the Wall.

236
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,237
We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.

237
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,594
And we can't get more men
without help from the Warden ofthe North.

238
00:17:57,999 --> 00:17:59,671
Apologies, my lady.

239
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,235
(DOOR CLOSES)

240
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,798
Lord Commander.

241
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:15,470
How can I help you?

242
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,551
Come with us when we ride south.

243
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,472
None of us know the castle as well as you do.

244
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,950
lts hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people.

245
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,595
Winterfell was your home once.

246
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,395
Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?

247
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:36,388
Castle Black is my home now.

248
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,797
The Night's Watch take no part
in the wars ofthe Seven Kingdoms.

249
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,232
There's only one war.

250
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,758
Life against death.

251
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,836
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

252
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,876
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

253
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,997
Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.

254
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,514
No visions. No magic.

255
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,107
Just life.

256
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,789
Do you feel my heart beating?

257
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,230
There's power in you.

258
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,956
You resist it, and that's your mistake.
Embrace it.

259
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,352
The Lord of Light made us male and female.

260
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,434
Two parts of a greater whole.

261
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,913
ln ourjoining, there's power.

262
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,675
Power to make life,

263
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,149
power to make light,

264
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,195
and power to cast shadows.

265
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,757
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

266
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,119
Then we shouldn't tell him.

267
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,189
-I can't.
-Why?

268
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,034
I swore a vow.

269
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,552
I loved another.

270
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,149
The dead don't need lovers.

271
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,314
Onlythe living.

272
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,987
I know.

273
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,998
But I still love her.

274
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,470
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

275
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,995
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

276
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,754
Are you lonely?

277
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,668
Just bored.

278
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,035
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

279
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,708
Were you bored a lot, too?

280
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,672
I know Castle Black
is no place for a child, but...

281
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,227
I like it. I thought I'd be left at home.

282
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:39,957
I know Mother didn't want to bring me.

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,149
Why do you say that?

284
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,992
She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

285
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,439
She shouldn't have said that.

286
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,917
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

287
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,275
When you were an infant,

288
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,074
a Dornish trader landed on Dragonstone.

289
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:21,071
His goods werejunk
except for one wooden doll.

290
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,671
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colours of our house.

291
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:33,077
No doubt he'd heard of your birth
and assumed new fathers were easy targets.

292
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,351
I still remember how you smiled
when I put that doll in your cradle.

293
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:42,631
How you pressed it to your cheek.

294
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,075
By the time we burned the doll, it was too late.

295
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,876
l was told you would die.

296
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,953
Or worse,

297
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,838
the greyscale would go slow.

298
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,831
Let you growjust enough to know the world
before taking it away from you.

299
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,388
Everyone advised me to send you
to the ruins of Valyria

300
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,549
to live out your short life with the stone men,

301
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,359
before the sickness
spread through the castle.

302
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,791
I told them all to go to hell.

303
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,553
I called in every maester
on this side ofthe world.

304
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:25,597
Every healer. Every apothecary.

305
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,636
They stopped the disease and saved your life.

306
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,998
Because you do not belong across the world
with the bloody stone men.

307
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,914
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

308
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,317
And you are my daughter.

LlTTLEFlNGER:
lthought I might find you here.

311
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,752
Your Aunt Lyanna.

312
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,591
Father never talked about her,

313
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,798
but sometimes I'd find him down here
lighting the candles.

314
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,953
They say she was beautiful.

315
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,158
I saw her once.

316
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:03,311
l was a boy living with your mother's family.

317
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,198
Lord Whent held a great tourney at Harrenhal.

318
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,911
Everyone was there.

319
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,991
The Mad King, your father,

320
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,637
Robert Baratheon,

321
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,634
and Lyanna.

322
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,835
She was already promised to Robert.

323
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:23,468
You can imagine what it was like for me,
a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name,

324
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,074
watching these legendary men
tilting at the lists.

325
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,671
The last two riders were Barristan Selmy
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

326
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,275
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered for their prince.

327
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,190
lrememberthe girls laughing
when he took off his helmet,

328
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,349
and they saw that silver hair.

329
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,555
How handsome he was.

330
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:45,318
Until he rode right past his wife,

331
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,989
Elia Martell, and all the smiles died.

332
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,475
I've never seen so many people so quiet.

333
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,557
He rode past his wife,

334
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,708
and he lay a crown of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

335
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,233
Blue as frost.

336
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,868
How many tens ofthousands had to die
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

337
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:14,356
Yes, he chose her.

338
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,469
And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

339
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,759
Come.

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,788

343
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,433
Where are you going?

344
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,475
King's Landing.

345
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,992
King's Landing?

346
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,070
Cersei sent for me.

347
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,468
We mustn't let her sniff out anytrouble.

348
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,272
You can't leave me here.

349
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,431
I know how hard it is
to live with people you despise.

350
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,509
Believe me.

351
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,428
But it won't be for long.

How do you know?

00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,116
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.

354
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,194
He'll march south to King's Landing
before the winter snows block his way.

355
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,477
But first, he has to take Winterfell.

-You don't knowthat.
-I do.

357
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,796
Once he liberates these lands
from the Boltons,

358
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,235
he'll rally your father's bannermen
to his cause.

359
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,677
With the North behind him,
Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

360
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,556
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

361
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,919
He has a larger army.

362
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,514
He's the finest military commander
in Westeros.

363
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,228
A betting man would
put his money on Stannis.

364
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,595
lam a betting man.

365
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,431
And if you're right?

366
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,476
Stannis takes Winterfell,

367
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,518
he rescues you from
the most despised family in the North.

368
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,432
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

369
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,875
he names you Wardeness ofthe North.

370
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,193
But I...

371
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,837
lwouldn't...

372
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,239
Wardeness ofthe North?

373
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,436
You are the last surviving Stark.

374
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,875
He needs you.

375
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:00,632
And what ifyou're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?

376
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:03,313
Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?

377
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,755
Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
and make him yours.

378
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,834
I don't know how to do that.

379
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:10,637
Of course you do.

380
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,357
He's already fallen for you.

381
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,438
His father frightens me.

382
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,033
He should. He's a dangerous man.

383
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:20,916
But even the most dangerous men
can be outmanoeuvred.

384
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,749
And you've learned to manoeuvre
from the very best.

385
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,509
l'll return before too long.

386
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,318
You be strong without me.

387
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:40,790
The North will be yours.

388
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,398
Do you believe me?

389
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,310
I expect I'll be a married woman
bythe time you return.

As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.

397

Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers a good ending.

398
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,519
I don't care
what's sung about me when I'm dead.

No?

Two knights offto rescue a princess.
Sounds like a good song to me.

401
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,119
Sounds like all the rest.

402
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:19,630
What about you?

403
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,914
What shit way would you choose?

404
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,034
In my own keep, drinking my own wine,
watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

405
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,590
How disappointing.

something more exciting planned.

I want my death to be boring.

JAIME: As I said. Why?

416
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,355
What's to stop him
from docking down the coast,

417
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,954
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

418
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,439
A bag of gold.

how much people hate your family
in this part ofthe world.

421

Why are you here?

Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

441

It was a near thing, really.

442
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,950
Thought the sharks would get us.

443
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:37,790
There are no sharks in Dorne.

444

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,351
You passed notes to Varys' little birds.

534
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,389
She found out, didn't she?

535
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,629
Found out and exiled you.

536
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:08,831
Now you hope to
win back her favour with a gift.

537
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,679
Risky scheme.

538
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,909
One might even say desperate.

539
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:19,551
You think Daenerys will execute me
and pardon you?

540
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:23,314
I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

541
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,995
(BIRD SCREECHES)

542
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,718
Everyone looks happy enough from up here.

543
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,112
-(LAUGH|NG)
-What?

544
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,036
l was thinking about all the times your brother

545
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,430
made me go with him down from the Red Keep
into the streets of King's Landing.

546
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,192
-Why?
-He liked to walk among the people.

547
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,793
He liked to sing to them.

548
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:01,668
He sang to them?

549
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,352
-Yes.
-(LAUGHS)

550
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,120
Rhaegar would pick a spot on the Hook,
orthe Street of Seeds, and then he'd sing.

551
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,474
Just like all the other minstrels.

552
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,629
And what did you do?

553
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:13,438
I made sure no one killed him.

554
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,598
And I collected the money.

555
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,590
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

556
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,556
-He was good?
-He was very good.

557
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,833
Viserys nevertold you?

558
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:24,308
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

559
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:28,033
Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.

560
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,999
And what did you do with the money?

561
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,231
Well, one time, he gave it
to the next minstrel down the street.

562
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,675
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage in Flea Bottom.

563
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:39,315
One time, we got horribly drunk.

564
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,714

566
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:46,670
Hizdahr is here,
waiting in the audience chamber.

567
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,508
How many others are there?

568
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,599
Fifty? 100?

569
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,271
Willyou bejoining us?

570
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,909
lthink I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

571
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,355
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

572
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,358
Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

573
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,558
Your Grace.

574
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,636
All men must die, but not all can die in glory.

575
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,676
-G|ory?
-Why else do men fight?

576
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:19,309
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea
and conquerthe Seven Kingdoms?

577
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,835
So their names would live on.

578
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:24,592
Those who find victory in the fighting pits
will never become kings,

579
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,636
but their names will live on.

580
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,471
It's the best chance they'll ever have.

581
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,959
Is that what you used to tell men

582
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,793
before you set them
to butchering each other for sport?

583
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,599
Today is the traditional start
ofthe fighting season.

584
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,317
I do not recognise this tradition.

585
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:40,357
Traditions are the onlything
that will hold this city,

586
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:41,838
your city, together.

587
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,197
Without them, former slaves and
former masters have nothing in common.

588
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:52,309
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

589
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,795
I can't promise
this is the answer to all our problems,

590
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:58,837
but it's a start.
