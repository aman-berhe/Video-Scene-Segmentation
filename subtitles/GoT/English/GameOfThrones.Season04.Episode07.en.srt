00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,188
The opportunity to live and die at the Wall
as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

5
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,315
You threw your life away.

You understand that, don't you?

7

Of course it's ajoke,
just not a very funny one.

that she had fallen in love with me.

17

out of sight at last.

All so perfect.

19
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,108
It felt good to take that from him.

20
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,393
He knows l'm innocent
and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.

21
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,549

31

32

even though you weren't there to save me.

I can't save you this time either.

I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.

No.

ofthe wildling army, Lord Snow,

189
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,396
First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch
brought atop the Wall.

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,629

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,389
My lord.

195
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,478
You have new clothes.

196
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,318
Do you like 'em? Eh?

197
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,992
Gloves are doeskin.

198
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,353
Softer than a virgin's thighs.

199
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,158
I sent for you days ago.

200
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,310
-|'ve been a bit busy.
-Doing what?

201
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,750
My lonesome bachelor days are over.

202
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,398
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

203
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,838
Lollys Stokeworth?

204
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,398
She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

205
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,071
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

206
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,479
She's dim-witted.

207
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,231
If I wanted wits, l'd marry you.

208
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,958
When my sister arranged this love match,

209
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,909
did she mention
that Lollys has an older sister?

210
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,632
Falyse.

211
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,233
Aye, I did know.

212
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,071
And you understand the rules of inheritance?

213
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,559
Falyse is 40 and barren.

214
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,915
She still gets Castle Stokeworth
when her father dies.

215
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,193
She does.

216
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,668
Unless she happens to perish
before her father.

217
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,830
Then Lollys gets the castle.

218
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:34,352
What? Ladies fall from their horses
and snap their pretty necks all the time.

219
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,714
You and my sister deserve each other.

220
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:39,669
Why did you bother to come here?

221
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,310
You once said if anyone ever asked me
to sell you out, you'd double their price.

222
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,197
Is it two wives you want or two castles?

223
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,268
One of each will do.

224
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,951
But ifyou want me
to kill the Mountain foryou,

225
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,439
it'd better be a damn big castle.

226
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,398
I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

227
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,238
l have gold.

228
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,469
What can I buy with gratitude?

229
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,470
You might be surprised.

230
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,789
A Lannister always pays his debts.

231
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,154
Your sister's a Lannister, too.

232
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,309

with my head still on my shoulders,

234
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,272
I may one day rule the North in her name.

235
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,393
I could carve you out a big piece of it.

236
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,317
If and may and could.

237
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,071
lt's bloody cold up north.

238
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,913
Lollys is soft and warm. And close.

239
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,549
lfl gave you the choice between
fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain,

240
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,869
you'd have your britches down
and your cock out before I could blink.

241
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,474
Does he frighten you so much?

242
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,754
I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.

243
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,070
He's freakish big and strong.

244
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,116
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man ofthat size.

245
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,708
Maybe I could take him,

246
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,675
dance around
until he's so tired of hacking at me,

247
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,876
he dropped his sword,
get him off his feet somehow.

248
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,951
But one misstep

249
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,439
and I'm dead.

250
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,837
Why should I risk it?

251
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,794
Because you're my friend.

252
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,758
Aye, I'm your friend.

253
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,954

for me?

Why are you sorry?

260
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,957
Because you're an evil bastard
with no conscience and no heart?

261
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,592
That's what I liked about you in the first place.

262
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,753
We had some good days together.

263
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,432

I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.

I cannot pursue my talents.

It was. I...

319
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,434
Humour isn't my strength.

320
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,433
That's because most jokes are lies
and you're devoted to the truth.

Ifthey're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

322

Not always.

323
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,868
Most ofthese powders and potions

324
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:26,948
are lies.

they witnessed our Lord's power.

Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was,

A pinch ofthis powder in a bonfire

329
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,550
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

will drive him wild with lust.

No.

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,590
Are you here to see our queen?

360
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,877
She's in a good mood.

361
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,950
Khaleesi.

362
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,031
-You're here early.
-Laterthan some.

363
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,033
-You don't approve?
-|t's not a question of approval,

364
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,553
it's a question oftrust.

365
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,277
You neither approve nor trust.

366
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,032
Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

367
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,475
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company
before pledging your sword to my brother?

368
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,993
Idid.

369
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,148
I trust you.

370
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,628
Daario Naharis killed his captains

371
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,836
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grewtired oftheir commands.

372
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,751
How could you ever have faith
in a man like that?

373
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,070
I could never have faith in a man like Daario.

374
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:43,069
That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons
to retake Yunkai.

375
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,396
-You have?
-I have.

376
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,356
Without you there to rule, Khaleesi,

377
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,635
I fear the masters will simply bide their time,

378
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,869
wait for the invaders to leave
and reassert control.

379
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,508
That is why I've ordered Daario
to execute every master in Yunkai.

380
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:01,639
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

381
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:03,994
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.

382
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,388
Theytrain little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

383
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:09,312
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

384
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:12,630
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

385
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,710
is also treating men like beasts.

386
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,959
The slaves you freed,
brutality is all they've ever known.

387
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,358
Ifyou want them to know something else,

388
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,159
you'll have to show it to them.

389
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:25,868
And repay the slavers with what? Kindness?
A fine? A stern warning?

390
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,598
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all ofthem,

391
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,148
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

392
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,799
Let the priests argue over good and evil.

393
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,518
Slavery is real.

394
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,351
I can end it. I will end it,

395
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,715
and those behind it.

396
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,188
I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

397
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,229
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

398
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,629
I wouldn't be here to help you
if Ned Stark had done to me

399
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:52,358
what you want to do to the masters onunkai.

400
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,707
The man who came to me the other day
about burying his father.

401
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,035
Hizdahr zo Loraq?

402
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,674
He will accompany the Second Sons
and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.

403
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,353
He will tell the masters
what has happened in Meereen.

404
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,796
He will explain
the choice they have before them.

405
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,476
They can live in my new world
orthey can die in their old one.

406
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:24,199
Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.

407
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,599
Tell him I changed my mind.

408
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,158
Yes, Khaleesi.

409
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:34,433
No.

410
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,348
Tell him you changed my mind.

411
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,077
HOUND: (GRUNTS) Rat cunts.

412
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:57,149
Fucking whore.

413
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,033
You're doing it wrong.

414
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,309
You need to burn awaythat horrible bit there.

415
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,788
Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester.

416
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,714
I know you don't like fire,
but ifyou don't do it right...

417
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,438
No fire.

418
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,237
It'll only take a second.

419
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,309
-It won't hurt that much.
-No fire!

420
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,036
Shut up about it.

421
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,036
About everything.

422
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,557
Thanks to you, I'm awalking bag of silver
anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.

423
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,673
Which is everywhere between
where we are now and where we're going.

424
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:54,276
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

425
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,478
getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.

426
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,070
No reward is worth this much trouble.

427
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,869
Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

428
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:18,314
You say your brother gave you that sword.

429
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,716
My brother gave me this.

430
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,749
It was just like you said a while back.

431
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,348
Pressed me to the fire like
I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

432
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,029
VVhy?

433
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,916
Thought I stole one of his toys.

434
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,149
I didn't steal it. I wasjust playing with it.

435
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,918
The pain was bad.

436
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,668
The smell was worse.

437
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,353
But the worst thing was that
it was my brother who did it.

438
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,839
My father, who protected him,

439
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:07,388
told everyone my bedding caught fire.

440
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,795
You think you're on your own?

441
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,189
Let me wash it out
and help you sew it up at least.

442
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,990
BRIENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.

443
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:58,354
We've been sleeping in ditches
the last few weeks.

444
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,318
I think we can treat ourselves to
a featherbed for the night

445
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,550
and a hot meal not cooked by you.

446
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,914
Couldn't agree more, my lady.

447
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:07,229
Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.

448
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,469
-Not working for your former lord any longer.
-Yes, my lady.

449
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,875
Don't get drunk.

450
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,195
No, my lady.

451
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,507
HOT PIE: Can I get you anything else?

452
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,317
No, this will do nicely, thank you.

453
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,752
Kidney pie is wonderful.

454
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,638
Thanks.

455
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,751
I do my best.

456
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,595
A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.

457
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:29,751
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.

458
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,591
Easy enough. But the meat,

459
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,319
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

460
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,958
and calves' kidneys is not easy.

461
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,634
I mean,
some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.

462
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,229
Got no right to cook anything, them.
Oh, and the gravy.

463
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,950
Don't get me started on the gravy.

464
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,392
Very difficult to get right.

465
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,151
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.

466
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:49,275
You cannot give up.

467
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,758
No gravy, no pie.

468
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,513
Simple as that.

469
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,431
That's nice armour. Are you a knight?

470
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,833
No.

471
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,912
Oh, it's just people with armour
are usually knights.

472
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:05,467
Generally speaking.
From King's Landing, though, aren't you?

473
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,233
From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.

474
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,436
What brings you to these parts?

475
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:11,868
We're looking for someone.

476
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,314
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

477
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,594
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17...

478
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,636
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.

479
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,791
Her name is Sansa Stark,
but she may be using a different name.

480
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,913
Starks?

481
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,229
What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?

482
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,990
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

483
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,512
I heard they was all traitors.

484
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,793
Don't need no traitors in here.

485
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:42,030
I pledged my life to their mother
Catelyn Stark.

486
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,031
I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.

487
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,148
Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

488
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,075
-What?
-|t's nothing, my lady.

489
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,353
You wouldn't be screwing your face up
like that if it was nothing.

490
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,510
Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.

491
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,271
You're not interesting enough to be offensive.

492
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,879
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.

493
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,836
The Lannisters have money.

494
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,791
People kill for money.

495
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,038
I don't think we should be telling people
we're searching for Lady Sansa.

496
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,478
My lady. My lord. Could I have aword?

497
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,916
-What about? Not kidney pie.
-You seem like a proper lady.

498
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:44,991
Someone who could be trusted.

499
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,956
I never met no Sansa Stark.

500
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,159
But I know her sister.

501
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,828
Arya.

502
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:58,916
No one's seen Arya Stark
since her father was beheaded.

503
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,718
She's presumed dead.

504
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,997
She weren't when I last spoke to her.

505
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,468
-When was that?
-Heading up north with the Night's Watch.

506
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,152
She was all dressed up as a boy.

507
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,629
Like your Iadyship, only without the armour.

508
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,516
Going by the name Arry.

509
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,157
-So what happened to her?
Well...

510
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,433
The quick version.

511
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,396
The Lannisters took us prisoner.

512
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,632
We escaped.

513
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:22,517
The Brotherhood took us prisoner.
They sold me to the innkeep.

514
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,235
They were gonna sell Arya to her mother
at Riverrun along with another prisoner.

515
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,029
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.

516
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,872
-Not friendly.
-The Hound.

517
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,154
That's the one.

518
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,357
Ifyou find her, could you give herthis?

519
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:40,829
She liked the last one I gave her,
but, well, this one turned out better.

520
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,507
Um...

521
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,430
You were saying?

522
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,439
BRIENNE: Her mother's dead,
grandfather's dead,

523
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,828
Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.

524
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,319
The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.

525
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,151
They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

526
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,272
Whythe Eyrie?

527
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,315
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.

528
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,950
Catelyn Stark's sister.

529
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,032
She's Arya's last living relative with money.

530
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,270
She hates the Lannisters.

531
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:22,072
Lord Tyrion made sure
I knew which house married which

532
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,639
BRIENNE: Sansa could be there, too.

533
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,631
PODRICK: Could be.

534
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,677
You sure about this?

535
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:42,398
No.

536
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:00,593
(DOOR OPENS)

537
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,193
I imagined
you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

538
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:19,591
I did spend some time with
an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.

539
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,988
Mmm. Do tell.

540
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,073
I've got every kind of filth down here
except the kind I like.

541
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,993
Your sister.

542
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,069
Oh.

543
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,673
Cersei approached me.

544
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,750
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.

545
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,754
How worried your sister is about her.

546
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,232
She was trying very hard to pretend
she had not come to sway me against you.

547
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,834
I think she may have even believed it herself.

548
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:57,913
Making honest feelings do dishonest work
is one of her many gifts.

549
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,832
It was difficult for her
to hide hertrue intentions.

550
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,149
It is rare to meet a Lannister

551
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,948
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead Lannisters.

552
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,835
She desperately wants to see you killed.

553
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:16,668
She didn't need to bother you.

554
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,637
It looks as though
I've taken care ofthat myself.

555
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,556
The joy she will feel when
my head leaves my neck.

556
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,673
She's wanted this for a long time.

557
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:30,469
Yes, I know.

558
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,350
We met, you and I.

559
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,998
Many years ago.

560
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,830
I think I would have remembered that.

561
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:41,070
Unlikely. You had just been born.

562
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,517
Our father brought me and my sister Elia
with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.

563
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,591
My first time away from Dorne.

564
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,749
I didn't like anything about the Rock.

565
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,794
Not the food, not the weather,
not your accents.

566
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,313
Nothing.

567
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,394
But the biggest disappointment,

568
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,354
you.

569
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:09,271
You and my family have more in common
than you might admit.

570
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,148
The whole way from Dorne
all anyone talked about was

571
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:17,152
the monsterthat had been born
to Tywin Lannister.

572
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,949
A head twice the size of his body,

573
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,712
atail between his legs,

574
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,791
claws, one red eye,

575
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,634
the privates of both a girl and a boy.

576
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,915
That would have made things so much easier.

577
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,150
When we met your sister,
she promised she would show you to us.

578
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,199
Every day we would ask.
Every day she would say, "Soon."

579
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,954
Then she and your brother

580
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,393
took us to your nursery and...

581
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,917
...she unveiled the freak.

582
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,549
Your head was a bit large,
your arms and legs were a bit small,

583
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,834
but no claw.

584
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:57,274
No red eye. No tail between your legs.

585
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,828
Just a tiny pink cock.

586
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,750
We didn't try to hide our disappointment.
"That's not a monster," I told Cersei.

587
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,876
"That'sjust a baby."

588
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,959
And she said, "He killed my mother."

589
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,079
And she pinched your little cock so hard,
lthought she might pull it off.

590
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,115
Until your brother made her stop.

591
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,508
"It doesn't matter," she told us.

592
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,670
"Everyone says he will die soon.

593
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,478
"I hope they are right.

594
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,914
"He should not have lived this long."

595
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,199
Well, (SNIFFLES)

596
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:39,231
sooner or later,
Cersei always gets what she wants.

597
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,558
And what about what I want?

598
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:48,355
Justice

599
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,798
for my sister and her children.

600
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,836
Ifyou wantjustice,

601
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:56,558
you've come to the wrong place.

602
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,675
I disagree.

603
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,673
I've come to the perfect place.

604
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,714
I want to bring those who have wronged me
tojustice.

605
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,553
And all those who have wronged me
are right here.

606
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,276
I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane,

607
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,795
who killed my sister's children

608
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,111
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

609
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,793
before killing her, too.

610
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,070
I will be your champion.

611
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:41,832
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

612
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,158
Hello, Robin.

613
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,269
What are you doing?

614
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,159
I'm building my home, Winterfell.

615
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,074
At least I think I am.
I haven't been backthere in avery long time.

616
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,394
Why did you leave?

617
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:47,834
It's along story.

618
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,228
I stay here in the Eyrie.

619
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,194
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and I have to keep myself safe

620
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,998
because I'm the Lord ofthe Vale

621
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,310
and a very important person.

622
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,551
Yes, you certainly are.

623
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:01,758
When will you go back?

624
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,593
Probably never.

625
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,388
Oh.

626
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,551
Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?

627
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,958
No, I'm afraid not.

628
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,030
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

629
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,076
-That sounds dangerous.
-(CHUCKLES)

630
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:22,514
-How do you make people fly?
-We don't.

631
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,999
What do you do with all the bad people

632
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,389
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

633
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,356
I never did anything with them at all.

634
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,476
Girls didn't take part in that
where I came from.

635
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:33,708
Well, I'm Lord ofthe Vale.

636
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,156
When I grow up,
I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.

637
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,150
Or you. When we get married,

638
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,070
you can tell me ifyou don't like somebody

639
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,070
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

640
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,717
Right through the Moon Door.

641
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,270
I like the sound ofthat.

642
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,952
Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

643
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,314
All right.

644
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:54,436
-It can go in here in this big tower.
-Be careful.

645
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,910
You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to
rebuild the whole thing.

646
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,228
-I didn't ruin it.
-You did.

647
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,151
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a Moon Door.

648
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
-I was fixing it.
-Knocking things down isn't fixing them.

649
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,359
-|t's ruining them.
-I didn't ruin it!

650
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,350
-You're being stupid.
-I didn't ruin it!

651
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,396
(GRUNTING)

652
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,312
(PANTING)

653
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,238
(GASPS)

654
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,439
-(SOBB|NG)
-Robin, I'm sorry, I...

655
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,077
LITTLEFINGER: Children.

656
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,712
-I hit him.
-Yes, I saw.

657
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,598
-I shouldn't have done that.
-No.

658
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,793
His mother should have, a long time ago.

659
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,871
Consider it a step in the right direction.

660
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,599
If he tells Aunt Lysa...

661
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,830
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

662
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,633
Iwas trying to remember
what everything looked like.

663
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,276
I'll never see it again.

664
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,473
A lot can happen between now and never.

665
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,870
Ifyou want to build a better home,

666
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,679
first you must demolish the old one.

667
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,150
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

668
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,231
Tell me why.

669
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:20,150
I loved your mother
more than you could ever know.

670
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,635
Given the opportunity,

671
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,871
what do we do to
those who've hurt the ones we love?

672
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,989
In a betterworld,

673
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:42,552
one where love could
overcome strength and duty,

674
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,190
you might have been my child.

675
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,474
But we don't live in that world.

676
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:04,832
You're more beautiful than she ever was.

677
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,993
Lord Baelish...

678
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,877
Call me Petyr.

679
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,953
(WIND WHISTLING)

680
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,156
You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?

681
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,757
Come here, Sansa.

682
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:57,429
Do you know how far the fall is?

683
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,348
No.

684
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,835
Neither do I, precisely.

685
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:04,955
Hundreds of feet.

686
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,112
It's fascinating

687
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,589
what happens to bodies when
they hit the rocks from such a height.

688
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,796
The impact breaks them right apart.

689
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:15,952
Like eggs dropped on the floor.

690
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,349
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

691
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,187
You'll find the head sitting on its own.

692
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,235
Every hair in place.

693
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,959
Blue eyes staring at nothing.

694
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:37,108
I know what you did.

695
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,752
I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.

696
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,910
I never should have hit Robin.

697
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,195
-I promise it won't happen...
-Don't be coy with me, you little whore.

698
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,589
You kissed Petyr.

699
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,875
-I didn't. You don't understand.
-I saw you.

700
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,952
You can't lie to me
because I saw it with my own eyes.

701
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:55,314
-He kissed me. I pulled away.
-Liar! Whore!

702
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:57,594
-(WH|MPERING)
-He is mine!

703
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,148
My father, my husband, my sister,

704
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:02,195
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

705
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,989
That's what happens to people
who stand between Petyr and me.

706
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,593
Look down!

707
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:10,796
-Look down!

708
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,551
Let her go.

709
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,157
You want her?

710
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,873
This empty-headed child?

711
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:24,948
Let her go.

712
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,157
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

713
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,236
I lied foryou. I killed foryou.

714
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,278
-Why did you bring her here?
-|'|| send her away.

715
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:40,228
I swear on my life.

716
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,749
I swear to all the gods.

717
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,637
Let her go, Lysa.

only one, my entire life.

725

Your sister.
