and make his bed again.

And she was always angry with me.

56

to me more softly, then.

Monsters are dangerous,
and just now kings are dying like flies.

89

Lord Tyrion should apologise immediately.

in Westeros to bed without his supper.

114
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,030
You're a fool ifyou believe he's the
most powerful man in Westeros.

115
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,997
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is King.

116
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,593
You really think a crown gives you power?

117
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,635
No.

118
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,317
I think armies give you power.

119
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,912
Mmm-hmm.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,151
Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle,

121
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,875
and you defeated him all the same.

122
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:56,994
Mmm-hmm.

123
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,957
Oh, I know.

124
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,713
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

125
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,314
Orthe blame, I suppose,
depending on your allegiance.

126
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,752
Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?

127
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,709
No.

128
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,229
He never would have risked such an action

129
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,549
if he didn't have certain assurances.

130
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,675
Which he got from me.

131
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,196
Do you disapprove?

132
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,032
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

133
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,189
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,919
Explain to me why it is more noble

135
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,071
to kill 10,000 men in battle
than a dozen at dinner.

136
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,629
So that's why you did it? To save lives?

137
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,752
To end the war. To protect the family.

138
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,559
Do you want to write a song
for the dead Starks?

139
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,030
Go ahead, write one.

140
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,556
I'm in this world a little while longer

141
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,188
to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.

142
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,635
The Northerners will never forget.

143
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,153
Good.

144
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:58,834
Let them remember
what happens when they march on the South.

145
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,792
All the Stark men are dead.

146
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,471
Winterfell is a ruin.

147
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,069
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden ofthe North

148
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,708
until your son by Sansa comes of age.

149
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,150
I believe you
still have some work to do on that score.

150
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,438
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

151
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,829
after I tell her
how we murdered her mother and brother?

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,912
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,195
I will not rape her.

154
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,752
Shall I explain to you
in one easy lesson how the world works?

155
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,593
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

156
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,637
The house that
puts family first will always defeat

157
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,790
the house that puts the whims and wishes

158
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,949
of its sons and daughters first.

159
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,389
A good man does everything in his power

to better his family's position,

161
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,716
regardless of his own selfish desires.

162
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,192
Does that amuse you?

163
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,555
No, it's a very good lesson.

164
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,631
Only it's easy for you
to preach utter devotion to family

165
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,280
when you're making all the decisions.

166
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:14,111
Easy for me, is it?

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,431
When have you ever
done something that wasn't in your interest,

168
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,590
but solely for the benefit ofthe family?

169
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,147
The day that you were born.

170
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,551
I wanted to carry you into the sea

171
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,630
and let the waves wash you away.

172
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,990
Instead, I let you live.

173
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,514
And I brought you up as my son.

174
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,472

BRANDON: Maybe we shouldn't stay here.

184
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,470
You'd rather be out there?

185
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,157
There are a lot of stories about this place.

186
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,519
Horrible stories.

187
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,750

188
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,194
So did I. Once.

189
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,551
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

190
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,755
No. Who's he?

191
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,194
Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

192
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,833
He was angry at
the King for something, I don't remember.

193
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:24,833
When the King was visiting the Nightfort,

194
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,115
the cook killed the King's son,

195
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,636
cooked him into a big pie
with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.

196
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,678
That night he served the pie to the King.

197
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:41,069
He liked the taste of his son so
much, he asked for a second slice.

198
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,311
The Gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

199
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,829
who could only eat his own young.

200
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:53,914
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever
since, devouring his own babies.

201
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,835
But no matter what he does,
he's always hungry.

202
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,872
lfthe Gods
turned every killer into a giant white rat...

203
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,269
It wasn't for murder
the Gods cursed the Rat Cook

204
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,953
or for serving the King's son in a pie.

205
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,229
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

206
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,959
That's something the Gods can't forgive.

207
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,234
"The late Walder Frey," old Tully called me

208
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,789
because I didn't get
my men to the Trident in time for battle.

209
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,915
He thought he was witty.

210
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,474
Look at us now, Tully.

211
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,188
You're dead,
your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead,

212
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,552

his wedding night in a dungeon,

213
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,473

217

218

Who does he have?

219
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,433
As you say.

220
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,315
They all laughed at me, all those high lords.

221
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,277
They all thought they were better than me.

222
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:07,873
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

223
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,114
People snigger when I marry a young girl,

224
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,635
but who said a word
when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?

225
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,551
You'll be needing a new young girl.

226
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,868
Yeah.

227
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,029
Got that to look forward to.

228
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,469
Hmm.

229
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,074
And you, the Warden ofthe North.

230
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,198
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

231
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,115
Must have been torture
following that stupid boy all over the country.

232
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,508
He ignored my advice at every turn.

233
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,914
lf he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

234
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:42,072
Calling himself
the "Young Wolf." How's that for pomposity?

At some point perhaps.

242
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,957
But Winterfell's in ruins.

Yeah.

244
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,471
What happened up there?
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

245
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,235
I heard he
killed all the ravens. And afterthat, nothing.

246
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,232
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

247
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,391
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the
ironborn ifthey gave us Theon.

Oh. And?

249
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,832
Ramsay delivered the terms.

250
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,913
The ironborn turned on Theon,
as we knew they would.

251
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,838
They handed him overtrussed and hooded.

But Ramsay, well...

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,355

"still in our lands and flaythem living,

Get that out of my sight.

368
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:43,756
Theon disobeyed my orders.

369
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,475
The boy is a fool.

370
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,957
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

371
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,757
I will not give up the lands l have seized,

372
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,354
the strongholds l have taken.
Get this away from me.

373
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,793
He's your son.

374
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,399
Son?

375
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,360
He's not a man any more.

376
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:14,351
He's your son. He's my brother.

377
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,309
He's a Greyjoy.

378
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,992
Watch yourself.

379
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,511
I've made my decision.

380
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,630
And I've made mine.

381
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,433
I'm going to pickthe fastest ship in our fleet.

382
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,071
I'm going to choose
the 50 best killers on the Iron lslands.

383
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,912
MAN: Get those ropes!

384
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,556
YARA: I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea,

385
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,675
all the way to the Weeping Water.

386
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:50,957
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.

387
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm going to find my little brother,

388
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,279
and I'm going to bring him home.

389
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,033
What is it?

390
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,627
Dragonglass.

391
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:06,437
We found them at the Fist.

392
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:09,278
Someone buried them a long time ago.

393
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,035
Someone wanted us to find them.

394
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:15,517
Why? What are they for?

395
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,677
Killing White Walkers.

396
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,392
How do you know that?

397
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,596
GlLLY: The Walker came for my baby.

398
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:27,867
And Sam...

399
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:30,917
But no one's killed
a White Walker in thousands of years.

400
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,515
Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.

401
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,797
Take it, Hodor.

402
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,992
And the archer.

403
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:54,717
I got lucky with one ofthem.

404
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,474
There are more.

405
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,313
Many more.

406
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,116
And for every one ofthem,

407
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,152
the dead men,

408
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,118
more than you could count.

409
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,232
lwish you'd come with us.

410
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,912
lwish I could.

411
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:18,117
I really do.

412
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,272
How are you keeping?

413
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,597
Great. Never better.

414
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,875
lt wasjust a bit of blood.

415
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,677
I should have known.

416
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,910
Everytime
a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

417
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,072
We're not really people to you.

418
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,798
Just ways to get what you want.

419
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,073
l'm notahighborn.

420
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,275
She called you "Ser."

421
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,678
I heard it.

422
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,388
A recent state of affairs.

423
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,388
l was born in Flea Bottom, just like you.

424
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:41,028
Sure, you were.
You're my friend. You're here to help.

425
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,950
I lived belowthe Street of Flour.

426
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,350
How far below?
How close to the Red Keep were you?

427
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,314
The shit that poured from their privy pipes

428
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,914
flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill,

429
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,674
along Tanner's Row
and right in front of my front door

430
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,670
-on Gin Alley.
-Gin Alley.

431
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,234
The Street of Steel,
with your armour and your knights?

432
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,469
(SCOFFS)

433
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,790
You lived in the fancy part oftown.

434
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,238
And here we are now.

435
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,876
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

436
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,276
Yeah, we've come a long way.

437
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,309
We're all the same, really.

438
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,277
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

439
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,827
lfyou mistrust fancy people so much,

440
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,427
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

441
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,233
You're me.

442
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,593
Never been with a woman.

443
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,274
Never talked to a woman, really.

444
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,077
And then she comes at you,

445
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,830
big words, no clothes.

446
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,875
What would you have done?

447
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:53,198
She does know her way
around a man's head, I'll give herthat.

448
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,793
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

449
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,315
So how'd you become a lord?

450
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:02,311
Oh. That's a long story.

451
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,119
Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.

452
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,115
Many years ago I helped King
Stannis out of a difficult situation.

453
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,835
He rewarded me with a lordship.

454
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,392
And this.

455
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,238
You see?

456
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,592
Highborns.

457
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:31,671
I didn't want to be a lord.
I nearly didn't accept.

458
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,112
Why did you?

459
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,918
I did it for my son.

460
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,515
I didn't want him to step over a river of shit

461
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,193
every time he stepped through his front door.

462
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,833
I wanted him to have a better life.

463
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,668
Does he?

464
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,393
He's dead.

465
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,313
How'd he die?

466
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,631
Following me.

467
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,793
When did you come to this strange country?

468
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,438
When I was 13.

469
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,151
You were only a child.

470
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,714
I stopped being a child when l was nine.

471
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,350
My mother made sure ofthat.

472
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,873
You've been a good
influence on our mutual friend, you know.

473
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,509
He used to drink from sundown to
sunup, visit three brothels a night,

474
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,988
gamble away his father's money.

475
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,831
Now it's just the drinking.

476
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,149
And now I'm his wife's servant.

477
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,471
l brush her hair
and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.

478
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,357
She is a sweet young thing.
None ofthis is her fault.

479
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,748
I love that girl. I would kill for her.

480
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,114
Do you think that makes it easier for me?

481
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,350
No, I expect not.

482
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,673
She's young
and she's beautiful and highborn.

483
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,877
We break bread with them,
but that doesn't make us family.

484
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:09,872
We've learned their language, but
we'll never be their countrymen.

485
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:14,277
lfyou let yourself believe

486
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,429
that a foreign girl with no name

487
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,750
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister...

488
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,113
l have a name.

489
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,467
You have one name.

490
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,792
As do |. Here, onlythe family name matters.

491
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:28,109
What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

492
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,157
Diamonds.

493
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,993
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

494
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,513
but you know how to protect yourself.

495
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,637
Get on one ofthose
ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

496
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,591
You can buy a house
with these diamonds, a very large house.

497
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,397
Hire servants.

498
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:54,188
Start a new life, a good life, far from here.

499
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:59,110
The mysterious foreign
beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.

500
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,278
Why do you want me to leave?

501
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,590
Tyrion Lannister is one ofthe few people alive

502
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,875
who could make this country a better place.

503
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:08,917
He has the mind, the will,
and the right last name.

504
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,227
And you,

505
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,952
you are a complication.

506
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,396
I know you love him.

507
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,149
And I know it's
true love, not bought by gold and silver.

508
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,514
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

509
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,113
I'm asking you to leave

510
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,069
because your presence
in the capital endangers him.

511
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,633
This will never be your home, my lady.

512
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:38,474
Find a true home somewhere far from here,

513
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,795
while there's still time.

514
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,035
Lord Varys.

515
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,110
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

516
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,958
Keep up.

517
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:04,795
I don't think I can, my lord.

518
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,194
It's not easy being drunk all the time.

519
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,349

520
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:13,078

She doesn't deserve this.

528
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,553
Deserve?

529
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,391
Be careful with that.

530
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,318
Start trying to work out who deserves what,

531
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,152
and before long you'll spend your days

532
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:52,077
weeping for every person in the world.

Balerion the Dread.

723
