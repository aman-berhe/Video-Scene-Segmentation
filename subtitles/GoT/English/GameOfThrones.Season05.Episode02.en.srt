00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,068
-|t's athreat.
-Of course it's athreat.

186
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,040
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

187
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:34,235
"lt's athreat."

188
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,670
No note?

189
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,672
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

190
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,751
and every othertragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

191
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,273
lwill burn their cities to the ground
ifthey touch her.

192
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,031
-Softer.
-What?

193
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,108
Not so loud.

194
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,872
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

195
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,155
The world can't know she's our daughter.

196
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,675
Then don't call her your daughter.

197
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,239
You've never been a father to her.

198
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:00,674
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

199
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,670
And what has your caution brought?

200
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,032
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

201
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,394
Our only daughter shipped offto Dorne.

202
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,759
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

203
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,474
I'm going to make things better.

204
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,992
You've never made anything better.

205
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,435
I'm going to Dome
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

206
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,429
(SCOFFS)

207
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,148
You can't just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

208
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,513
She's promised to his son.

209
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:38,388
I'm not going to ask him anything.

210
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,357
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

211
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,078
No army.

212
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,274
Do you know where they're keeping her?

213
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,913
-Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
-|'|| find her.

214
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,197
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

215
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,235
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,877
You're going to Dorne?

217
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,236
A one-handed man, alone.

218
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,311
I never said I was going alone.

219
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,640
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

220
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,790
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

221
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,394
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

222
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,436
We can have a harp ifyou like, but no flutes.

223
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,749
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

224
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,308
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

225
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,435
That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?

226
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,558
Don't they?

227
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,754
Don't who?

228
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,673
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

229
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,678
They certainly do, my dear.

230
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,110
It's a fine place, isn't it?

231
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,599
A fine place.

232
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,989
lneverthought l'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

233
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,633
You won't.

234
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,594
Pardon?

235
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,591
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

236
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,830
When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

237
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,194
She hates me.

238
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,515
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

239
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,352
she pulls my hairwhen Mother's not looking.

240
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,750
You know what I think?

241
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,875
I think you're a good person.

242
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,915
And your sister is a mean person.

243
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,352
She is.

244
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,111
I've been all over the world,

245
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,156
and ifthere's one thing I've learned,

246
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,310
it's that meanness comes around.

247
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,070
People like your sister,

248
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,436
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

249
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,431
One way or another.

250
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:38,991
Who's that?

251
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,756
Jaime fucking Lannister.

252
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:48,198
-Ser Jaime.
-Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

253
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,794
l was very sorry to hear about your father.

254
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,199
Thank you.

255
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,198
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

256
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,869
A pleasure.

257
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,152
Run along, love.

258
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,231
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

259
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,392
When were you planning on getting married?

260
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:15,629
-Just get on with it.
-On with what?

261
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,198
What you're here for.

262
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,032
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

263
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,078
It's very good for you.

264
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:36,597
-Lo||ys will be marrying SerWillis Bracken.
-Mmm.

265
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,869
We made a deal, your sister and l.

266
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,394
I would have advised against that.

267
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,835
How is this good for me?

268
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,912
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

269
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,352
And when we return,

270
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,830
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

271
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,835
Return from where?

272
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,995
As far south as south goes.

273
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:12,756
TRYSTANE: My future queen.

274
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,437
(SPEAKING SOFTLY)

275
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,071
You are beautiful.

276
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,677
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

277
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,431
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long axe and I'll shove it up your...

278
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,032
DORAN: Captain.

279
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,515
Let her pass.

280
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:48,109
Your brother was murdered,

281
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,432
and you sit here in the Water Gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

282
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,558
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

283
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:58,948
-Your brother.
-You don't have to remind me.

284
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,712
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

285
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,628
What will you do about his death?

286
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:06,108
lwill bury him. I will mourn for him.

287
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,235
And then?

288
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,712
You would have me go to war?

289
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,074
The whole country would have you go to war.

290
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,879
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

291
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,992
The Sand Snakes are with me.

292
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,672
They have the love oftheir people.

293
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:24,197
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

294
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,233
Oberyn is dead,

295
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,998
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens,

296
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,674
eating our food, breathing our air.

297
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,708
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

298
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,758
Let me have her.

299
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,035
Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.

300
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,715
I loved my brother.

301
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,869
And you made him very happy.

302
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,997
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

303
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,276
But we do not mutilate little girls
forvengeance.

304
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,553
Not here.

305
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,153
Not while I rule.

306
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,516
And how long will that be?

307
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,037
DAARIO: The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

308
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,238
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

309
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,151
Of course you haven't found
any Sons ofthe Harpy.

310
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,557
You haven't, have you?

311
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:34,594
(GRUNTS)

312
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:38,151
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

313
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,800
they drink, whore,

314
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,632
fight in the streets,

315
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,072
they blend in.

316
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,390
They overhear things in taverns,

317
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:50,028
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

318
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,031
break a few fingers,

319
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,791
overhear a few more things.

320
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,958
Before you know it...

321
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,554
No one here.

322
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,119
We go.

323
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,878
In a hurry? You're afraid?

324
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,836
Unsullied fear nothing.

325
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,233
Right.

326
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,639
That's your problem.

327
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:31,473
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

328
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,794
Someone who's forgotten fear

329
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,672
has forgotten how to hide.

330
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,309
(MAN SCREAMS)

331
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:43,914
(GROANS)

332
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,550
Fear is useful that way.

333
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:56,994
(SCREAMS)

334
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,837
Sons ofthe Harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

335
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:17,437
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

336
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,747
It would send a message.

337
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,354
I think you should exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

338
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,435
VVhy?

339
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,157
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

340
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,038
The Son ofthe Harpy
has no more valuable information.

341
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,315
How do you know that?

342
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,277
Because I questioned him.

343
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,750
HlZDAHR: And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

344
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,794
He is born free.

345
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,029
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

346
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,439
Perhaps the onlything that gave him pride

347
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,316
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

348
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,355
They pay him.

349
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,431
Great families afraid to do a thing.

350
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,119
They pay poor men to do it for them.

351
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,997
-And how do you know this?
-Everyone knowthis.

352
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,990
I don't know it,
and I'm the head ofa great family.

353
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,354
BARRISTAN: We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

354
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:53,795
Give him atrial at least. A fairtrial.

355
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,999
Show all the citizens of Meereen

356
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,354
that you're betterthan
those who would depose you.

357
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,475
Teach them a better way.

358
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,869
I do not knowthe place
from where Old Ser comes.

00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,236
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

360
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,231
But here in Meereen,

361
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,157
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

362
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,434
So we learn much about them,

363
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,510
orwe do not live long.

364
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,669
They teach me what they are.

365
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,753
Mercy, fairtrial, these mean nothing to them.

366
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,034
All they understand is blood.

367
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,991
DAENERYS: Thank you all foryour counsel.

368
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,510
Your Grace, aword, please, I beg you.

369
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,147
-About what?
-About your father.

370
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,116
-About the Mad King.
-The Mad King?

371
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,679
You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?

372
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,955
Consider me reminded.

373
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,871
Your Grace,

374
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,314
I served in his Kingsguard.

375
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,833
l was at his side from the first.

376
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,236
Your enemies did not lie.

377
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,228
Go on.

378
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,679
When the people rose in revolt against him,

379
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,116
your father set their towns and castles aflame.

380
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,351
He murdered sons in front oftheir fathers.

381
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,635
He burned men alive with wildfire

382
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,357
and laughed as they screamed.

383
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,830
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

384
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,071
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

385
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,599
I'm not my father.

386
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,319
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

387
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,073
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

388
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,835
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

389
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,319
Until the very end.

390
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,829
I will not have the Son ofthe Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

391
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,191
Your Grace.

392
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:54,992
-(NE|GH|NG)
-(BLEAT|NG)

393
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,313
There's a bug.

394
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,798
Yes, best be careful.

395
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:07,552
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

396
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:12,235
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

397
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,474
Besides,

398
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,036
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

399
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,074
You don't like it?

400
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,116
-I want to take a walk.
-You can't.

401
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,670
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

402
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,636
She ought to offer her cunt.

403
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,789
Best part of her for the best part of me.

404
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,388
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

405
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,993
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

406
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,956
talking about the futility of everything?

407
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,155
You're right. No point.

408
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,991
The road to Volantis?

409
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,913
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

410
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,319
The road to Meereen.

411
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:52,709
And what do you hope to find
at the end ofthe road to Meereen?

412
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,915
ltold you. A ruler.

413
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,194
We've already got a ruler.

414
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,628
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

415
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:03,837
Every pile of shit on the side of every road
has someone's banner hanging from it.

416
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,954
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

417
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,951
During your brieftenure as Hand.

418
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,392
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

419
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,755
Still, a man oftalent.

420
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,238
Managed to kill a lot of people.

421
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,148
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

422
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,119
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

423
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,278
She begged me.

424
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,474
lwouldn't go.

425
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:30,994
VVhy?

426
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,512
'Cause I liked it.

427
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,117
Power.

428
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,156
Even as a servant.

429
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,231
People follow leaders.

430
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,549
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

431
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,834
| find us repulsive.

432
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,750
And we find them repulsive,

433
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,036
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

434
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,189
to keep them away.

435
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,031
And yet,

436
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,189
no matterwhat we do,

437
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,511
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

438
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,112
Not for long.

439
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,998
You're right.

440
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,309
-Let's go for awalk.
-No.

441
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,436
How many dwarves are there in the world?

442
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:13,079
ls Cersei going to kill them all?

443
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,319
(FLY BUZZING)

444
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,392
Not him.

445
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,317
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

446
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,910
Shall I throwthem in a cell, Your Grace?

447
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,069
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

448
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,313
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

449
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,833
Mistakes will be made.

450
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,592
-Thank you, Your Grace.
-Thank you, Your Grace.

451
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,272
-Take the head.
-Pardon me, Your Grace.

452
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,236
I would take it, ifyou don't mind.

453
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,436
It could prove useful for my work.

454
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:38,434
Very good.

455
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,709
Overthere will be fine.

456
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,874
You heard the man. Overthere.

457
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,434
(DOOR CLOSES)

458
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,832
You're the Hand ofthe King?

459
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,318
No, Uncle.

460
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,949
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

461
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,995
l'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

462
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,558
and chooses a Hand for himself.

463
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,952
Your Grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

464
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,075
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough...

465
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,559
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

466
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:31,958
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

467
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,750
In addition to being Master ofShips,

468
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,474
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

469
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,950
Oh, Your Grace.

470
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,315
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

471
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,867
He said he would be honoured to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

472
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,870
The honour is all mine, Your Grace.

473
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,072
Your Grace, in the past on several occasions,

474
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,628
a grand maester has served
as the King's Hand.

475
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:59,348
The king has named beurn
the new Master ofWhisperers.

476
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,680
Your Grace, him? This man?

477
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,832
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

478
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,755
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

479
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,795
The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.

480
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,311
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

481
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,791
Far more than many ever have.

482
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,512
I must say, I cannot see...

483
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,751
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander ofthe Lannister armies,

484
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,195
it would please the king
ifyou would serve as his Master of War.

485
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,316
No man living better deserves the title.

486
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,469
That is kind of you to say.

487
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,755
lwould like to hear it from the king himself.

488
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,067
The king is very busy at this moment.

489
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,475
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

490
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,959
He is learning.

491
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,477
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

492
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:51,154
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

493
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,118
And to you. And to serve the king.

494
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,998
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

495
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,188
To watch you stack the Small Council
with sycophants.

496
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,232
Sending your own brother away
so he wouldn't be...

497
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,991
My brother has left the capital to

498
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,190
lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

499
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,268
What mission?

500
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,953
That is not your concern as Master of War.

501
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,429
I do not recognise your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

502
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:20,871
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

503
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,079
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

504
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,277
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

510
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,591

-Right, very good.

512

Huh!

513
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,151
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark,

514
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,672
was elected at the age of 10?

515
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,437
lknow S.

516
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,077
You'll learn, I promise.

517
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,118
ltaught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning newthings.

518
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,236
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

519
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,874
Very patient.

520

| only said that the more time
that you spend practising,

521
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:17,873
the faster you'll be able to read.

522
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:20,598
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

523
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,470
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

524
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,029
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

525
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,518
-Three.
-Three?

526
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,597
No, old Maester Cressen did.

527
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:38,078
I had a lot oftime to practise.

528
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,230
My mother kept me inside because...

529
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,427
What do you call it in the south,
what happened to your face?

What do you call it north ofthe Wall?

00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,557
I don't know.

533
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,592
But two of my sisters had it.

Foryou, Mhysa.

713
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,389
You wanted the Harpy dead,

714
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,556
but your hands were tied.

715
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,559
I set you free, as you did all of us.

716
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:12,597
He was our prisoner, awaiting trial.

717
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,393
You had no right.

718
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,393
He would rather rip your city apart
than see slaves lifted from the dirt.

719
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,989
There are no more slaves.

720

and murders your children?

724
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,510
I was the first to take up the knife for you.

725
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,079
I rememberthe look on my father's face
as I struck down his Master,

726

who had traded his infant son for a dog.

727
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,154
My father died in the fighting.

728
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,194
Ifwe allow the Sons ofthe Harpy
to return us to chains,

729
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:02,795
he never lived.

730
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:09,427

732
