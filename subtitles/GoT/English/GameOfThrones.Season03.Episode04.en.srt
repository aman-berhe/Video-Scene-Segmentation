I don't know. Do |?

49
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,230
As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of
actors through the Free Cities.

50
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,196
One day in Myr,

51
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,717
a certain man made
my master an offer too tempting to refuse.

52
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,950
I feared the man meant to use me

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,270
as I'd heard some men used small boys.

54
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,748
But what he wanted was far worse.

55
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,509
He gave me a potion
that made me powerless to move or speak,

56
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,478
yet did nothing to dull my senses.

57
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,994
With a hooked blade he sliced me,

58
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,628
root and stem, chanting all the while.

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,030
He burned my parts in a brazier.

60
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:03,034
The flames turned blue,
and I heard a voice answer his call.

61
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,354
I still dream ofthat night.

62
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,876
Not ofthe sorcerer, not of his blade.

63
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:18,274
I dream ofthe voice from the flames.

64
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,988
Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?

65
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,229
I don't know.

66
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,436
But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.

67
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,515
And ever since that day, l have hated magic
and all those who practice it.

68
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,193
But you can see why I was eager to aid in your

69

70
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,473

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,675

the actual person who tried to have me killed,

75
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,996
which will require
a degree of influence, which...

76
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,039
You do not possess at the moment.

77
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:04,232
But influence is
largely a matter of patience, I have found.

78
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,072
Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,

79
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,998
he threw me out of his house to die.

80
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,073
I resolved to live to spite him.

81
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,592
I begged.

82
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,638
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.

83
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,869
I became an excellent thief,

84
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,396
and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters

85
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,109

than the contents of his purse.

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,679
(SCREAMS)

357
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,238
Put him back where he belongs.

358
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,913
(SCREAMING)

359
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,034
Eat.

360
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,432
What are you doing?

361
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,957
I'm dying.

362
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,110
You can't die.

363
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:33,755
You need to live to take revenge.

364
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:35,955
I don't care about revenge.

365
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,792
You coward.

366
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,555
A little misfortune and you're giving up.

367
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,719
Misfor...

368
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,914
Misfortune?

369
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,314
You lost your hand.

370
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:51,038
My sword hand. I was that hand.

371
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,154
(SCOFFS)

372
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,436
You have a taste,

373
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,158
one taste ofthe real world

374
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:00,958
where people have
important things taken from them,

375
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,759
and you whine and cry and quit.

376
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,078
You sound like a bloody woman.

377
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,878
I know what you did for me.

378
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,073
You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.

379
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,907
It's called the Sapphire lsle
because ofthe blue of its water.

380
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,835
You knewthat.

381
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,916
Why did you help me?

382
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,829
(SIGHS)

383
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,717
You wanted to speak to me?

384
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,836
Yes, about Jaime.

385
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,478
What about him?

386
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,278
I wanted to make sure we're doing

387
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,152
everything we can to get him back.

388
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:40,232
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner,

389
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,987
what did I do in response?

390
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,394
You started a war.

391
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:48,518
And if I would start
a war for that lecherous little stump,

392
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:51,671
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

393
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,953
Whateveryou can.

394
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,117
Whatever I can.

395
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,793
You're still here.

396
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:11,232
Yes.

397
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,474
VVhy?

398
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,954
Did it ever occur to you that

399
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,439
I might be the one who deserves

400
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,913
your confidence and your trust,

401
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,319
not your sons?

402
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:24,118
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.

403
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,159
Years and years of lectures
on family and legacy... (CHUCKLES)

404
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:32,949
The same lecture, really,
just with tiny, tedious variations.

405
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,552
Did it ever occur to you that your daughter

406
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,110
might be the only one
listening to them, living bythem?

407
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,636
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

408
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,392
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

409
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,673
(BLOWS)

410
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,874
All right. Contribute.

411
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,550
The Tyrells are a problem.

412
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:02,912
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

413
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:06,150
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

414
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:10,107
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.

415
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,590
She knows how to manipulate him.

416
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,956
Good. I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

417
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,074
I don't distrust you because you're a woman.

418
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,550
l distrust you because
you're not as smart as you think you are.

419
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,074
You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod

420
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,668
over you and everyone else in this city.

421
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,067
Perhaps you should try
stopping him from doing what he likes.

422
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,799
IwiII.

423
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,630
GIRL: Do you like it, Nana?

424
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,438
Another golden rose. How original.

425
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,635
| eat from plates stamped with roses.

426
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,875
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.

427
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,678
l have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

428
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,795
as ifthat makes it smell any better.

429
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,597
Roses are boring, dear.

430
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,034
"Growing strong."

431
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,111
Ha! The dullest words of any house.

432
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,954
"Winter is coming!" Now that's memorable.

433
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,952
"We do not sow." Strong. Strong.

434
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,836
Those are houses you watch out for.

435
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,878
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.

436
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,393
But a golden rose growing strong,

437
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,994
(SCOFFS) that strikes fear in the heart.

438
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,278
Look, little loves.

439
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,156
A spider in the garden.

440
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,715
Run along now. Grow strong.

441
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,279
My lady.

442
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,511
lwanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

443
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,908
The city has
been made brighter by your presence.

444
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,877
The city is made brighter by my presence?

445
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:53,747
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?

446
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,272
A little obvious, perhaps.

447
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:00,479
Oh, no, please.
Seduce away. It's been so long.

448
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,869
Though I ratherthink it's all for naught.

449
00:28:02,959 --> 00:28:06,156
What happens when
the non-existent bumps against the decrepit?

450
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,476
A question for the philosophers.

451
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,393
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

452
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:14,390
-So?
-Might I sit?

453
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,548
No.

454
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,113
Come, I've heard you're such a clever man.

455
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,913
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

456
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,594
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.

457
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,557
Havel?
Because I spoke to her once in this garden

458
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:31,437
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

459
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,828
Why shouldn't I? She's an interesting girl.

460
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,068
Is she?

461
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,349
No, not particularly.

462
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,271
But she's had an interesting childhood.

463
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,231
She has, sadly.

464
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,195
Well, forgive me forwasting yourtime, then.

465
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,238
lthought we shared
certain hopes for her well-being.

466
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,154
(CHUCKLING) Come, come.
You surrender rather easily.

467
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:52,947
Walk with me.

468
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,999
I know the walls have ears,
but apparently the shrubbery does, too.

469
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:02,676
I choose my allies
carefully, and my enemies more carefully still.

470
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,591
Which is Sansa Stark?

471
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,989
Neither. A babe in the woods.

472
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,114
I admired her father.

473
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,268
Yes.

474
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,270
Ned Stark had many admirers,

475
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,193
and how many stepped forward
when the executioner came for his head?

476
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,430
I could not help Lord Stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.

477
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,919
How?

478
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:23,355
You're not the only one
who has taken an interest in her.

479
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,353
That's hardly surprising.
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.

480
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:30,715
lndeed.
She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.

481
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,518
It almost feels
as ifyou're about to arrive at the point.

482
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,067
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.

483
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,151
A confidant of mine has told me that

484
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,311
when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.

485
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,035
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

486
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,828
Littlefingerwas born
with no lands, no wealth, no armies.

487
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,151
He has acquired the
first two. How long before he has the army?

488
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:54,110
Perhaps you'll laugh,
but I know him betterthan most,

489
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,395
and this is the truth.

490
00:29:56,479 --> 00:30:00,711
Littlefinger is one of
the most dangerous men in Westeros.

491
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,270
lf Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.

492
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,192
And if he marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

493
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,871
Which seems such a shame.

494
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,915
Why should a man with such a low reputation

495
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,996
steal away such a lovely bride?

496
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:18,072
You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.

497
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,958
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

498
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,837
But he would see this country burn

499
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,790
if he could be king ofthe ashes.

500
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,231
You are a clever man, Lord Varys.

501
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,677
You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.

502
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,717
One doesn't need to
be clever for that. It's obvious, isn't it?

503
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,752
(CLEARS THROAT)

504
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,067
I didn't mean to disturb you.

505
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,474
You haven't.

506
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,998
We'd like some privacy, please.

507
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,912
lfyou wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

508
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,351
Or ifyou'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

509
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll ask the King to speak with you himself.

510
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,592
What did you pray for?

511
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,907
I can't tell you.

512
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,268
Why not?

513
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,793
I'll tell you
what I prayed for in the Sept this morning.

514
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:16,508
Let's see,
for my family's health and happiness,

515
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,557
for an end to the war, for a short winter.

516
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,030
Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?

517
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,838
I'm sorry, ljust can't.

518
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,913
MARGAERY: My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

519
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:32,035
When I was 12, l was all elbows and knees,

520
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:34,394
and Alanna
looked like a goddess sent to torture me.

521
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:36,197
"Pig Face," she called me.

522
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,038
(LAUGHS) "Pig Face"? That's ridiculous.

523
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,075
It had something to do with my nose.

524
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,038
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

525
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,553
-(O|NKS)
-(LAUGHS)

526
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:48,152
So I prayed that
she'd catch a horrible skin disease.

527
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,594
Aweek afterthat,
she came down with porridge plague.

528
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,749
Porridge plague?

529
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,915
Oh, you don't have it in the North?

530
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,275
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats,

531
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,078
and eventually,
your face slides off and you die in agony.

532
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,832
But that's awful.

533
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,908
(LAUGHS)

534
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,432
You're...

535
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,033
Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.

536
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,589
Don't saythat. No, you're not.

537
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,875
So what happened to Alanna?

538
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,836
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

539
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,753
and married a handsome
lord and they have darling children

540
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,477
and live in a castle by the sea.

541
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,198
It's all terribly frustrating.

542
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,679
SANSA: I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

543
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,875
You'll be married here in the capital,

544
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,631
and she'll have to come watch and

545
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,397
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

546
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:31,514
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

547
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,435
I want us to be friends, good friends.

548
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,711
That would make me very happy.

549
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,273
You must see Highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.

550
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:47,112
We have a great
masquerade the night ofthe harvest moon.

551
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,953
You should see the
costumes. People work on them for months.

552
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,872
Uh, l don'tthink
the Queen would let me leave King's Landing.

553
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:58,838
The Queen Regent, you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.

554
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,712
And ifyou were to marry Loras,

555
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,630
your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

556
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,759
We would be sisters,
you and I. Would you like that?

557
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,000
His name was Bannen.

558
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,310
He was a good man, a good ranger.

559
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,311
He came to us from...

560
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,831
Where did he come from?

561
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,638
Down White Harbor way.

562
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,636
He came to us from White Harbor.

563
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,597
Never failed in his duty.

564
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:51,591
He kept his vows the best he could.

565
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,069
He rode far, fought fiercely.

566
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,749
We shall never see his like again.

567
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,717
ALL: And now his watch has ended.

568
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,550
And now his watch has ended.

569
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:13,876
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.

570
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:16,757
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

571
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,229
That bastard Craster starved him to death.

572
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,833
Craster's got his daughters to feed.

573
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,472
RAST: You on his side?

574
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,757
We can't just show up and steal all his food.

575
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,955
We're brothers of
the Night's Watch, not thieves.

576
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,433
The day we leave,
Craster will tap a barrel of our wine,

577
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,398
and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes

578
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,471
and laugh at us starving in the snow.

579
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,871
He's a bloody wildling.

580
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,636
Never knew Bannen could smell so good.

581
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,951
You have one son, don't you, Mormont?

582
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,795
I had my 99th.

583
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,798
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

584
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,955
And more daughters than I can count.

585
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,075
I'm glad foryou.

586
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,234
Are you now?

587
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:22,709

you and yours have gone.

592
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,991
cut their throats and be done with it?

593
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,511
Or leave them ifyou've not the

There's sawdust in the bread.

You don't like it,
you go out there and eat the snow.

601

I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.

602
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,111
