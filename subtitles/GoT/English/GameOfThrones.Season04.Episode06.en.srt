-As was his brother before him.
-Yes.

The king's grandfather tells a different story.

24
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,431

whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

26
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,797

None.

seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending

you've sunk into Westeros.

61
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,477

-Tywin Lannister.
-How old is Tywin Lannister?

Sixty-seven.

67
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,798
And when he dies, who's in command?

68

70

00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,033

he was sworn to protect?

When Tywin's gone, who do you back?

74
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,838
That is a problem for another time.

75
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,196
I think it's a problem for now.

76
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,918
There's only one reliable leader left
in Westeros.

77
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,919
Stannis.

78
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,478
He's got the birthright.

He's in his prime.

80
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,435
He's a tried and tested battle commander.

81
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,592
And he doesn't just talk about
paying people back, he does it.

The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

86

87

the brave captain leads his men to victory.

88
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,671

"Captain, why do you call for your red shirt
before battle?"

"So that ifl am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."
