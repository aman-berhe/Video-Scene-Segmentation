183
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,315
I thought you'd be dead by now.

184
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,753

188

189
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,749
What?

190
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,478
No.

191
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,595
Why not? I'd fuck her.

192
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,718
-You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?
-|'m her squire.

193
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:43,988
Oh.

194
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,668
(CHUCKLES)

195
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,438
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

196
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,316
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

197
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,391
The way she looks at him.

198
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,119
The way all women look at him
is frankly irritating.

199
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,873
I preferred working with the little brother
on that account.

200
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,631
Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.

201
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,393
You must have shown it to her by now.

202
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,593
-She's training me to fight.
-Is she? Oh.

203
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,838
An hour in the morning, an hour at night.
Every day.

204
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,478
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

205
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,949
Well, that's a different sort of fighting.

206
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,598
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

207
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,070
You want to learn that sort of fighting?

208
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,752
All right.

209
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,395
All right, let's start with your footwork.

210
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,837
Show me your stance.

211
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,638
Now listen to me, Pod.

212
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,675
See how your feet are about a yard apart?

213
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,070
Lesson number one,
assume everyone wants to hit you.

214
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,072
'Cause they do, Pod.
Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.

215
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,478
Do it again.

216
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,709
Come on, don't sulk.

217
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,278
JAIME: I neverthought you'd find her.

218
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,712
I just assumed Sansa was dead.

219
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,877
Why would you assume that?

220
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,952
In my experience,
girls like her don't live very long.

221
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,268
I don't think you know many girls like her.

222
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,273
Well, I'm proud of you.

223
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,633
I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark
against all odds.

224
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,676
Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.

225
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,189
The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder,

226
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,669
so there is that complication.

227
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,714
What the hell are you doing here?

228
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,676
I've come for the Blackfish.

229
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,511
You're welcome to have him.

230
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,388
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat
back from the Boltons

231
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,278
and assume her rightful position
as Lady ofWinterfell.

232
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,157
With what army
does she plan on taking Winterfell?

233
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,592
The Tully army.

234
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,397
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

235
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,711
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
currently defended by the Tully rebels,

236
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,596
so you can see the conundrum.

237
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,750
The Tullys are rebels
because they're fighting for their home?

238
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,876
Riverrun was granted to the Freys
by royal decree.

239
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,475
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark
and slaughtering his family.

240
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,913
Exactly.

241
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,399
We shouldn't argue about politics.

242
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,038
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

243
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,918
I knowthere is honour in you.

244
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,876
-|'ve seen it myself.
-|'m a Lannister.

245
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,790
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

246
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:04,392
I do no such thing.

247
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,753
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

248
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,229
Ride south again with your mission complete
and your army intact.

249
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,878
What do you propose?

250
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,189
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag oftruce.

251
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,750
Let me try to persuade the Blackfish
to give up the castle.

252
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,875
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?

253
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,156
Because you'll allow him
to lead the Tully forces safely north.

Ifl persuade him to abandon the castle,
you'll grant us safe passage north.

263
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,157

264
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,870

the Blackfish to surrender

from your niece Sansa Stark...

280

I haven't seen her since she was a child.

Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.
Good man.

287
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,999
He always spoke highly of you.

288
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:33,593
And if he were here now,
I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

289
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,195
Ifyou think I'm abandoning my family's seat
on the Kingslayer's word of honour,

290
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,474
you're a bloody fool.

291
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,120
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters
and the Freys.

your one-handed friend thinks we can.

-No?

to cross the siege line and enter the castle?

295
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:54,312
Who gave you that sword
with the gold lion on the pommel?

296
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:58,233
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

297
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,198
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

298
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,315
He gave me this sword to protect her.

You should both be happy as well.

357
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,275
Not so long ago,
this city was ready to devour itself.

358
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:55,308
Now it's like a man reborn.

359
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:57,435
I will be happy when our queen returns.

360
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,876
Why don't you drink?
Why don't either of you ever drink?

361
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,153
Unsullied never drink.

362
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,274
-Why not?
-Ru|es.

363
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,754
And who made these rules?

364
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,874
Your former masters?

365
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.

366
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,436
Have a drink with me.

367
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,872
And you? What's your excuse?

368
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,195
I have tried wine before.
It made me feel funny.

369
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,759
That's how you know it's working.

370
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,798
Here's to our queen.

371
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,516
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

372
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,630
To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains,

373
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,189
long may she reign.

374
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,270
-Long may she reign.
-Long may she reign.

375
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,314
TYRION: Do you like it?

376
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,356
GREY WORM: Tastes like it has turned.

377
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:55,511
Yes, yes. Fermentation.

378
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:03,072
One day, after our queen has taken
the Seven Kingdoms,

379
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,792
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

380
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,231
Make my own wine.

381
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,838
The Imp's Delight.

382
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,910
Only my close friends could drink it.

383
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,793
Tell me ajoke, Missandei of Naath.

384
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,668
I do not know anyjokes.

385
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,469
Grey Worm?

386
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,108
Right.

387
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,397
Three lords walk into a tavern.

388
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:36,356
A Stark, a Martell and a Lannister.

389
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,437
They order ale,

390
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,033
but when the barkeep brings them over,

391
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,508
each ofthem finds a fly in his cup.

392
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,797
The Lannister, outraged,
shoves the cup aside and demands another.

393
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:51,588
The Martell plucks the fly out
and swallows it whole.

394
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,518
The Stark reaches into his cup,

395
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,710
pulls out the fly and shouts,

396
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,874
"Spit it out, you wee shit. Spit it out."

397
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,954
It's funnier in Westeros.

398
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,873
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

399
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,074
Yes.

400
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,798
Ajoke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

401
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,672
Not a true story, necessarily.

402
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,193
A storythat's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

403
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,717
Not at the moment, perhaps.

404
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,916
Missandei, do you like the wine?

405
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,389
I do.

406
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:30,707
Tell ajoke.

407
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,273
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

408
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,870
The first says,

409
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,631
"Do you know how to swim?"

410
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,433
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

411
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:54,236
Ah! (LAUGHS)

412
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,390
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

413
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:01,832
MISSANDEI:
You don't even know what ajoke is.

414
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,917
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hearjoke?

415
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,191
You lied to us.

416
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,074
I makejoke.

417
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,348

419
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:21,673
Morejokes.

420
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,229
I once walked into a brothel
with a honeycomb and ajackass.

421
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,199
-The madam says...

I apologise for the way the Freys treated you.

428
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,908
A man of your birth deserves better.

429
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,879
You have my word you'll be
properly fed and clothed from now on.

Oh, good.

434
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,189
Good, that's...

435
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,156
That's a fine thing.

436
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,717
My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser.

437
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,471
Whatever game you're playing.

438
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,551
The Blackfish is an old man.

439
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,550
A good death is all he can hope for.

440
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,438
But you, you have a child now, I've heard.

441
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:41,268
A son you sired on your wedding night.

442
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,032
You're a potent man.

443
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,632
A son I've never met

444
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,478
born of a wife that I haven't seen
since our first night together.

445
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,993
You should be with them both.

446
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,434
I can arrange that, you realise?

447
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,555
Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.

448
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:59,676
A tutor for your boy,
knights to train him to fight and to ride.

449
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,068
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

450
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,309
Do you imagine yourself a decent person?

451
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,953
Is that it?

452
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,997
After you've massacred my family.

453
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,352
Kept me in a cell for years.

454
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,589
Stolen our lands.

455
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,591
I'll remind you that our houses are at war.

456
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,235
I'm sorry ifthis conflict
has inconvenienced you,

457
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,674
but rebelling against the Crown
does have consequences.

Says the man who shoved his sword
through his king's back.

459
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,594
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

460
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,715
It's not.

461
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,272
You understand. On some level
you understand that you're an evil man.

462
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,592
I'll leave thejudgements to the gods.

463
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,874
Well, that is convenient for you.

Tell me, Iwant to know. I truly do.

469
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,918
How do you live with yourself?

470
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,075
All of us have to believe
that we're decent, don't we?

471
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,797
You have to sleep at night.

472
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,879
How do you tell yourselfthat you're decent

473
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,155
after everything that you've done?

474
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,996
I was your sister's prisoner once.

475
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,476
She hit me on the head with a rock
ifl remember correctly.

476
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,468
(LAUGHS)

477
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,634
Yeah.

478
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,788
She should have killed you.

479
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,632
Perhaps, but she didn't.

480
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,475
Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.

481
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,836
But I didn't hate her.

482
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,148
I admired her.

483
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,516
Far more than her husband or her son.

484
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,749
Do you think I care whom you admire
and whom you don't?

485
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:59,034
No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway
because you're my prisoner.

486
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,711
You don't have a choice.

487
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,750
The love she had for her children,
I was a little awed by it.

488
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,828
Oh.

489
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:10,867
Oh, I see.

490
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,472
You're a madman.

491
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,390
I'm not here to trade insults.

00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:18,913
-Your sister was a strong...
-Don't talk about Cat!

-|'|| talk about whomever I want.
-(GRUNT|NG)

494
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:24,954
She loved her children.

495
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,991
I suppose all mothers do,

496
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,876
but Catelyn and Cersei,

497
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,348
there's a fierceness you don't often see.

498
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,000
They'd do anything to protect their babies.

499
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,798
Start a war. Burn cities to ash.

500
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:41,552
Free their worst enemies.

501
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:43,675
The things we do for love.

502
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,753
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters. (PANTING)

503
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,080
That's exactly why I came here.

504
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,351
I love Cersei.

505
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,477
You can laugh at that ifyou want.
You can sneer. Doesn't matter.

506
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,711
She needs me.

507
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,112
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

508
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,033
I'll send for your baby boy.

(GRUNTS)

510
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,116
And I'll launch him into Riverrun
with a catapult.

511
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:20,313
Because you don't matter to me,
Lord Edmure.

512
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,038
Your son doesn't matter to me.

513
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,636
The people in the castle don't matter to me.

514
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,590
Only Cersei.

515
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,750
And if! have to slaughter every Tully
who ever lived to get back to her,

516
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,031
that's what I'll do.

I demand entry.

523
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:23,593
He's the Lord of Riverrun.
I have to obey his commands.

524
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,033
He's been their captive

525
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,918
ever since they murdered his king
at the Red Wedding.

526
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,033
Why do you think the people who murdered
his king at the Red Wedding

527
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,634
would decide to let him come home?

528
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,949
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

529
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:38,748
Don't let him in.

530
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,909
