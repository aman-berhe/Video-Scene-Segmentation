-I don't want you to be glad about it.

179
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,428
I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

180
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,030
And knowthis, boy.

181
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,392
Your death will be a gift
for them south ofthe Wall.

182
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,717
They'll never know what you've done.

183
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,549
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.

184
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,312
But they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

185
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,788
north ofthe Wall gave his life for theirs.

186
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
Now, do you understand me?

187
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,192
I do.

188
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,429
You're even dumber than you look.

189
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,911
It's just words, boy,

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,718
to keep us a little warmer in the night.

191
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,997

This letter detailing our infantry movements

198

of House Marbrand.

199
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,679
It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

200
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,474
My apologies, my lord. I must have...

201
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,791

Greater and the Lesser Houses.

202
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,677

What news from the capital?

228
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,711
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

229
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,712
Ah, the late King Renly.

230
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,232
Rather a short reign.

231
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,071
Murdered by awoman, I hear.

232
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,990
So they say.

233
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,596
There has been talk of other forces at work.

235
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,515

It is my beliefthat a moment of chaos
affords opportunities lost soon after.

239
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,275
You say that as ifyou were
the first man alive to think it.

240
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,315
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

241
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,152
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

242
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,834
After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.

243
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,956
Their lands are the most fertile
in the Seven Kingdoms,

244
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,793
-feeding horses and soldiers.
-Yes, yes, yes.

245
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,156
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any ofthe surviving kings.

246
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,590
Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for Renly's death.

247
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,791
And Margaery...

248
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,672
Yes, she does.

249
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,678
House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.

250
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,994
-Against my grandson.
-They did.

251
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,388
And perhaps that treason should be punished

252
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,993
one day,

253
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,197

254
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,592

And what else?

267
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,557
On your son Tyrion's directive,

268
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,596
I met with Catelyn Stark.

269

270
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,672
He had an interesting proposal for her
concerning her daughters.

271
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,795

We could question her.

277

You could.

278
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,188
She won't answer.

279
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,831

-Ygritte.

when you got to her.

00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,148

she'll bury it in your face.

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,992
Why do you want us to build a big fire?

289
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,996
Are there some more friends in the area?

290
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,277

you'll need those swords again.

He believed... The world believed
that the ages had turned them to stone.

535
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,750
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

536
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,478
But I dreamt that if! carried those eggs

537
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,755
into a great fire, they would hatch.

538
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,029
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

539
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,674
But when the fire burned out,

540
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,556
lwas unhurt,

541

With fire and blood, I will take it.

00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,114
Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

553
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,276

554
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,430
My father, my lord.

00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,713
Hmm.

556
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,711
I taught my son Jaime to read.

557
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,831
The maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

558
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,471
He couldn't make sense ofthe letters.

559
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,877
He reversed them in his head.

560
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,918
The maester said he'd heard tell
ofthis affliction

561
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,035
and that we simply must accept it.

562
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,598
Ha!

563
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,793
After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

564
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,673
He hated me for it, for atime.

565
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,678
For a long time.

566
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:57,118
But he learned.

567
00:33:58,519 --> 00:33:59,952
Hmm.

568
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,429
Where is your father? Is he alive?

569
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,029
Who was he?

570
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,629
A stonemason.

571
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,673

572
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:14,987

573
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,115

574
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,679

579
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,189
Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

580
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,788
No.

581
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:43,717

582
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,591

is always called a lady.

Unless she's a queen or a princess.

631
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,472
I could find someone who knows.

Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

There will be no talk. He will die forthis.

715
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:04,353
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.

716
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:06,907
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

717
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:10,833
He can raise a few hundred men and retake
Winterfell before the new moon.

718
00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:13,387
We have the Lannisters on the run.

719
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,510
lfyou march all the way back north now,
you'll lose what you gained.

720
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:21,635
My boy would be honoured
to bring you Prince Theon's head.

721
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:26,036
Tell your son Bran and
Rickon's safety is paramount.

722
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:28,754
And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.

723
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:33,113
I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.

724
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,270
And then I'll take his head myself.

725
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:39,156
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

726
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,593
I'm no liar.

727
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:46,033
All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

728
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,031
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

729
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,390
I hate the Starks as well as you do.

730
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,999
Let me serve you, my lord.

731
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,513
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

732
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,036
There are other ways to serve, my lord.

733
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,352
-|'m a prince now, and you'd do well...
-There are other ways to serve, my prince.

734
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,915
(CHUCKLES)

735
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:09,954
Like what?

736
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:15,068
We know things, the free people.

737
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:17,791
You knowthings?

738
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:19,988
Like what?

739
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,593
How to eat dirt? (LAUGHS)

740
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,395
(SCOFFS)

741
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:24,867
Other things.

742
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:28,229
Savage things.

743
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:50,391
I always wondered what you had under there.

744
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:53,472
It comes at a price.

745
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,518
I'm not killing you. That's your price.

746
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,999
I already had that.

747
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,353
What do you want then,

748
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,953
other than your miserable life?

749
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:04,518
What all free people want.

750
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,274
My freedom.

751
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:13,311
Well, you shall have it, then.

752
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:17,629
But only ifyou serve me well.

753
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,318
-Ow!
-Shh.

754
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,192
-|t's not deep.
-I thought they were going to kill me.

755
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,318
Theythought so, too.

756
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,390
He hated me, the man who hit me.

757
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:34,714
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

758
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:39,154
He never met me before,
but he wanted to hurt me.

759
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:42,517
-Of course he did.
-Why? Why would a stranger...

760
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,670
You are everything he will never have.

761
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,955
Your horse eats better than his children.

762
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,796
It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

763
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:52,515
Iwould have given them bread ifl had it.

764
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,075
I hate the king more than any ofthem.

765
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,153
Don't say these things.

766
00:46:57,239 --> 00:46:58,274
Ifthe wrong people hear you...

767
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:00,270
But you're not the wrong people.

768
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,712
Don't trust anybody.

769
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,712
Life is saferthat way.

(MURMURS)

771
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:51,157
And where are you going?

772
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,909
I have something foryou from Prince Theon.

773
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,876
-What?
-Me.

774
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,230
He says I'm to make the rounds.

775
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,318
And keep you warm.

(WHISTLES)

778
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:41,235
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

779
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,557
The Silk King won't support me
because of his business with the Lannisters.

780
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,595
Why offend his best customer?

781
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:49,955
And the Copper King offers me a single ship

782
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,600
on the condition that I lie with him for a night.

783
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,398
Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?

784
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,073
When I came to this city, I had nothing.

785
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,311
Truly nothing.

786
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,798
I slept by the docks.

787
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,678
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

788
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,671
If not, I dreamed of food.

789
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,788
Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.

790
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,832
Do you think the path from poverty to wealth
is always pure and honourable?

791
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,953
I have done manythings, Khaleesi,
that a righteous man would condemn.

792
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,157
And here I am, with no regrets.

793
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:41,592
Barthe gates. Ring the bells.

794
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,908
Slowly, Khaleesi.
