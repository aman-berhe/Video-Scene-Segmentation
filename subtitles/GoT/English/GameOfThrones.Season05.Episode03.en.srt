00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,072
And as it happens,

179
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,277
I've found the perfect girl
to solidify our hold on the North.

180
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,868
SANSA: That's Moat Cailin.

181
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,316
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

182
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,469
You've been here before?

183
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,393
On our way down to King's Landing
with my father and Arya.

184
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,349
Where are you taking me?

185
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,918
Home.

186
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,351
The Boltons have Winterfell.

187
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,155
Your marriage proposal, it wasn't for you.

188
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,394
No.

189
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:25,792
Roose Bolton murdered my brother.
He betrayed my family.

190
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,393
He did.

191
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,277
He serves the Lannisters.

192
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,587
For now.

193
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,909
-I won't go.
-Winterfe|l is your home.

194
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,354
-Not any more.
-Always.

195
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,272
You're a Stark.
Dying your hair doesn't change that.

196
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:43,035
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving child
of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

197
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,347
Your place is in the North.

198
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,433
I can't marry him. You can't make me.
He is a traitor. A murderer!

199
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,397
You're not marrying Roose Bolton.

200
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,790
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir, Ramsay.

201
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,631
One day he'll be Warden ofthe North
and you...

202
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,914
-No.
-Sansa.

203
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:01,515
No, you can't make me. I will starve myself.
I will die before I have to go there.

204
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,751
I won't force you to do anything.

205
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,273
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

206
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,549
Say the word and we turn the horses around,
but listen to me.

207
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,197
Listen.

208
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,270
You've been running all your life.

209
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,158
Terrible things happen to your family
and you weep.

210
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:21,151
You sit alone in a darkened room
mourning their fates.

211
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:25,517
You've been a bystander to tragedy
from the day they executed your father.

212
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,989
Stop being a bystander. Do you hear me?

213
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,273
Stop running.

214
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,434
There's no justice in the world.

215
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,638
Not unless we make it.

216
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,998
You loved your family.

217
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,596
Avenge them.

218
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:25,788
(HORSE NEIGHS)

219
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,233
MAN: Banners!

220
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,468
BRIENNE: We don't.

221
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,391
We go around.

222
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,869
Takes us miles out ofthe way.

223
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,108
We'll lose sight ofthem.

224
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,112
BRIENNE: Doesn't matter.
I know where they're going.

225
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,188
Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire?

226
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,151
How did you end up squiring forthe lmp?

227
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,988
He hates that nickname.

228
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,316
Well, he's not here to complain about it,
is he?

229
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:19,349
lsquired for a knight named Ser Lorimer
during the War ofthe Five Kings.

230
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,432
One night, he had a bit too much to drink,

231
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,988
and he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

232
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,114
He borrowed it?

233
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,474
He wasn't athief.

234
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,676
He was drunk, and hungry,
and he wasn't thinking.

235
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,956
l was drunk, too.

236
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,029
He gave me halfthe ham.

237
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,909
Next morning,
one ofthe guards saw him passed out

238
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
under awagon
with the hambone still in his hand.

239
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,712
They hanged him that afternoon.

240
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,193
They tied the noose for me, too,

241
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,193
but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,

242
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,507
so he pardoned me,

243
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,908
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

244
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,231
As punishment for both of you.

245
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,117
It didn't seem that way.

246
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,872
Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

247
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,154
Yes, all your lords have been very kind to you.

248
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,832
All except me.

249
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,195
Sorry, you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

250
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,271
I'm not sorry.
You're the best fighter I've ever seen.

251
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,719
You beat the Hound.

252
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,750
I'm proud to be your squire.

253
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,749
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

254
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,034
lfyou didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

255
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,714
You want to be a knight, Pod?

256
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,754
Yes.

257
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,433
Starting tomorrow,
we'll train with the sword twice a day,

258
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:37,033
before we ride in the morning
and after you make camp in the evening.

259
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,672
And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly.

260
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,748
Thank you.

261
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:43,148
I can't knight you,
but I can teach you how to fight.

262
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,991
I suppose that's more important.

263
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,031
You weren't a knight,

264
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,793
but you were a Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

265
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,233
l was.

266
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,515
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

267
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,868
He was.

268
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,032
How did you end up serving Renly?

269
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,034
When I was a girl, my father held a ball.

270
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,630
l'm his only living child,
so he wanted to make a good match for me.

271
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:28,187
He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth.

272
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,953
I didn't want to go,
but he dragged me to the ballroom.

273
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,912
And it was wonderful.

274
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,628
None ofthe boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

275
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:44,549
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

276
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,789
when they thought it was their turn to dance.

277
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,072
They whispered in my ear

278
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,675
how they wanted to marry me
and take me back to their castles.

279
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:58,791
My father smiled at me, and I smiled at him.

280
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,436
I had never been so happy.

281
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,749
Till I saw a few ofthe boys sniggering.

282
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,158
And then they all started to laugh.

283
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,118
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

284
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,792
They were toying with me.

285
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,675
"Brienne the Beauty," they called me.
Greatjoke.

286
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,670
And I realised I was the ugliest girl alive.

287
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,397
A great lumbering beast.

288
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,388
ltried to run away,
but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms.

289
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,953
"Don't let them see yourtears," he told me.

290
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,758
"They're nasty little shits,

291
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,637
"and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

292
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,029
He danced with me,
and none ofthe other boys could say a word.

293
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,075
Renly was the king's brother after all.

294
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,197
But wasn't he...

295
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,872
Lord Tyrion said he was...

296
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,597
Yes, Pod, he liked men. I'm not an idiot.

297
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,232
He didn't love me. He didn't want me.

298
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,914
He danced with me because he was kind,
and didn't want to see me hurt.

299
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,712
He saved me from being ajoke.

300
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,156
From that day until his last day.

301
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:22,949
And I couldn't save him in return.

302
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:29,829
Nothing's more hateful
than failing to protect the one you love.

303
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:33,870
One day I will avenge King Renly.

304
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,715
But you said a shadow murdered him.

305
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:38,754
How do you fight a shadow?

306
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,194
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.

307
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,309
I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart.

308
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,316
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

309
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,795
And a man can be killed.

310
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,509
-Lord Commander.
-Your Grace.

311
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,396
I'd like to speak alone.

312
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,629
Olly is my steward now,

313
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,869
as l was Lord Commander Mormont's.

314
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,155
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

315
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,197
One day he might command.

316
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:19,674
Very well.

317
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,796
Have you considered my offer?

318
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,388
l have.

319
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,435
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honour.

320
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,829
All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

321
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,398
Say the word and you will be.

322
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,958
But I have to refuse you.

323
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,829
l'm Lord Commander ofthe Night's Watch.

324
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,478
My place is here.

325
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,357
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

326
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,794
to take back the castle where you grew up.

327
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,755
To rule the North.

328
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:53,069
lwish I could fight beside you.

329
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,991
Believe me, I do.

330
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,073
l pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

331
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:03,036
You're as stubborn as your father.

332
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:04,954
And as honourable.

333
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,118
I can imagine no higher praise.

334
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,269
I didn't mean it as praise.

335
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,631
Honour got your father killed.

336
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,391
But ifyour mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

337
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,272
Are you bored of us already?

338
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:22,995
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army.
We will never forget that.

339
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,198
But it's a question of survival.

340
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,793
The Night's Watch can't continue
to feed your men

341
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:30,439
and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.

342
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,515
Winter is coming.

343
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,627
I know it.

344
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:39,758
We march on Winterfell within the fortnight,
before the snows trap us here.

345
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,108
And the wildlings?

346
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,270
lfthey'd rather burn than fight for me,
so be it.

347
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,553
I leave their fate to you.

348
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,479
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

349
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,312

699
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,794
For the night is dark and full ofterrors.

700
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,990
We should keep moving.

701
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,999
(CROWD REPEATING)

702
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,831
I was once as you are now.

703
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,351
Bought and sold,

704
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,671
scourged and branded,

705
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:28,948
The only red priest we had in King's Landing
was Thoros of Myr.

706
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,995
This one's much better-looking.

707
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,036
The Lord of Light hears your voice.

708
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,753
He hears the king as he hears the slave;

709
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,029
he hears the Stone Men in their misery.

710
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,872
Stone men.

711
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:43,269
Good luck stopping
the spread of greyscale with prayer.

712
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,316
You'd have better luck
dancing awaythe plague.

713
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:46,957
He has sent you a saviour!

714
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:51,312
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world!

715
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:54,951
The Dragon Queen!

716
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,509
We're going to meet the saviour.
You should have told me.

717
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,908
Who doesn't want to meet the saviour?

718
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:16,514
Come on.

719
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:19,831
Let's find a brothel.

MAN: Build your house in a day.

722
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:42,357
(SPEAKING VALYRIAN)
It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.

723
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:45,716
It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.

724
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:52,437
See? We blend right in.

725
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:55,636
Just two more travellers mad with lust.

726
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:01,872

00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,111

It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

732
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:24,236
We were just heading east to see you.

733
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,958
I've got a dragon for you.

734
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:28,109
How much to make him spit fire?

735
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:35,711
Someone who inspires priests and whores
is worth taking seriously.

736
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,232
What makes you worth that much?

737
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,674
-|'m magic.

Well, she's taken.

740
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:47,628
Where are you going?

741
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:50,029
I need to speak to someone with hair.

742

-He||o.
-He||o.

743
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,115
You've got no drink.

744
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,872
You've got no money.

745
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,951
Do I look like a man without money?

746
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,237
Nevertrust looks.

747
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,993
Until quite recently,
I was one ofthe richest men in the world.

(LAUGHS)

749
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,078
But who needs wealth
when you can make a woman laugh?

750
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:14,031
I always pay my debts.

751
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,833
I'm well known for it.

753
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,879
You like her.

754
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,678
They all like her.

755
00:54:24,759 --> 00:54:25,908
They all want to fuck a queen.

756
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:27,713
That's because they've never met a queen.

757
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:29,027
You're just saying that.

758
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,712
You know how to spot a liar.

759
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,948
Ifl could pick any girl here,

760
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,439
lwould pick you.

VVhy?

762
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,549
Because you have a sceptical mind.

763
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:48,229
All right, then. I'm warning you,
we're going to have to wash you first.

764

Come on.

765
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,438
I'm sorry, I can't.

766
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:04,108
Of course you can. You're shy.

767
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,599
I'm not.

768
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:09,187
Have another drink.

769
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,953
Gladly, but this, I can't do.

770
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:14,837
Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am.

771
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,797
I hope it passes.

772
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:19,834
What will I do in my spare time?

773
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:25,318

Oh.

778
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,671
I thought you were someone else.

Show's almost over.

780
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:55,115
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

781
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:57,068
You've made some kind of mistake.

782
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:59,832
Why don't you tell me
what you think you're doing, and then...

00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,515
I'm taking you to the queen.
