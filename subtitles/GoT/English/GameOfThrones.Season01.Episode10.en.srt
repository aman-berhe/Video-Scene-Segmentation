1
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,438
(Mufﬂed cheering and screams)

2
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,955
(Louder screaming and yelling)

3
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,191
Look at me. Look at mel

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,434
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,869
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,310
You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

7
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,112
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- I'm not a boyl

8
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,833
You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

9
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,711
Do you want to live, boy'ﬂ

10
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,395
North, boy, we're going north.

11
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,514
(Oawing)

12
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,833
It had three eyes.

13
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,795
It told me to come with him, so I did.

14
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,877
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

15
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,752
(Osha) Your father's not down there, little lord.

16
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,592
Not for many years yet.

17
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,955
- You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
- I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

18
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,071
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scored on

19
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,995
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go.

20
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:52,237
That's my grandfather, Lord Ricldard.

21
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,078
He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.

22
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,830
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

23
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,269
King Robert was supposed to marry her,

24
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,277
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

25
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,515
Robert started a war to win her back

26
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,597
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

27
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,037
That's where I saw Father.

28
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,717
You see? He's not here.

29
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,279
(Growling)

30
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:22,674
(Snarling)

31
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,948
(Screams)

32
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,988
(Boy) Hera. Shaaaydoa-
(Bran) Rickonl

33
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,111
That beast is supposed to be
chained in the kennelsl

34
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,272
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

35
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,550
- Come back up with us.
- No, I came to see Father.

36
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,037
How many times have I told you?
He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

37
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,435
He was down here. I saw him.

38
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,152
Saw him when?

39
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,317
Last night, when l was sleeping.

40
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,874
Here, Shaggydog.

41
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,750
You both miss him.

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,192
It's only natural he should
be in your thoughts and dreams,

43
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,150
but that doesn't mean that...

44
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,799


45
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,558
- My lady.
- My lady.

46
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,589
My lady.

47
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,869
My lady.

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,558
- My lady.
- My lady.

49
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,029
My lady.

50
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,312
(Panting)

51
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,033
(Gasping)

52
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,150
(Soft grunting, thudding)

53
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,352
(Louder grunting)

54
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,069
(T hudding and grunting continue)

55
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,914
Robb.

56
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,988
Robb.

57
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,751

58
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,755

- My boy.
- (Sobbing)

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,311
They have your sisters.

66
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,276
We have to get the girls back

67
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,834
And then we will kill them all.

68
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,512
J' The boars great tusks, they boded ill

00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,908

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,197
Very amusing.

81
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,310
Isn't it a funny song?

82
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,395
Thank you for your rendition.

83
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,954
I imagine it was even better meived
at that tavern.

84
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,036
I'm so sorry, Your Grace.

85
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,151
I'll never sing it again, I swear.

86
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,430
Tell me, which do you favour -

87
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,269
your ﬁngers or your tongue?

88
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,515
Your Grace?

89
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,794
If you got to keep one, which would it be?

90
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,110
Or I could just cut your throat.

91
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,795
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.

92
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,512
Good.

93
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,193
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

94
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,150
I won't sing, Your Grace.

95
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,238
Ser llyn, who better than you
to carry out the sentence?

96
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,675
I beg youl Please, no.

97
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,953

100
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,315
I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.

101
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,430
(Man sobs)

102
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,795
Your Grace, pleasel

103
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,274
You look quite nice.

Walk with me.
I want to show you something.

(Blade slashes)
(Gurgling)

108
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,628
Do as you're bid, child.

109
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,116
..and as soon as you've had your blood,
I'll put a son in you.

110
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:03,195
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

111
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,754
(Flies buzzing)

112
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:09,156
Nol Please, nol

113
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,951
This one's your father.

114
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,156
This one here.

115
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,429
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

116
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,312
- You promised to be merciful.
- l was.

117
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,430
I gave him a clean death.

118
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,273
Look at him.

119
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,312
Please let me go home.
I won't do any treason, I swear...

120
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,195
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here...and obey.

121
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,474
Look at himl

122
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,437
(Jeffrey) Well?

123
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,436
How long do l have to look?

124
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,235
As long as it pleases me.

125
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,198
Doyouwanttoseetherest?

126
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,549
If it please Your Grace.

127
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,551
That's your Septa there.

128
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,076
I'll tell you what,
I'm going to give you a present.

129
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,669
After I raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,234
I'm going to give you his head as well.

131
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,678
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

132
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:24,237
My mother tells me a king
should never strike his lady.

133
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,837
Ser Meryn.

134
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,710
Here, girl.

135
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,032
Will you obey nom

136
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,796
Or do you need another lesson?

137
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,390
I'll look for you in court.

138
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,795
Save yourself some pain, girl.

139
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,672
Give him what he wants.

140
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,272
You'll be needing that again.

141
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,750
The proper course is clear -

142
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,357
pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south to join our forces with his.

143
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:43,469
Renly is not the king.

144
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,948
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

145
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,797
He put your father to death.

146
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,710
That doesn't make Renly king.

147
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,393
He's Robert's youngest brother.

148
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,272
lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me,
Renly can't be king before Stannis.

149
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,311
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

150
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,913
- Renly is not Iightl
- (Greatjon) My lords.

151
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,793
- (Man) If we put ourselves behind Stannis...
- My lordsl

152
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,957
Here is what I say to these two kings.

153
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,593
(Spite!)
(Cheers, laughter)

154
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,075
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

155
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,509
nor Stannis neither.

156
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,236
Why should they rule over me and mine
from some ﬂowery seat in the South?

157
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:24,034
What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?

158
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,996
Even their gods are wrongl

159
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,552
(All laugh)

160
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,957
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

161
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,031
It was the dragons we bowed to...

162
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,992
and now the dragons are deadl

163
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,470
There sits the only king
lmeantobend my kneeto-

164
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,595
the King in the Northl

165
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:57,757
I'll have peace on those terms.

166
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,269
They can keep their Red Castle

167
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,073
and their iron chair too.

168
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,912
The King in the Northl

169
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,673
Am | your brother, now and always?

170
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,232
Now and always.

171
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,596
My sword is yours...

172
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,554
in victory and defeat,
from this day until my last day.

173
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,273
The King in the Northl

174
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,029
(All) The King in the Northl
The King in the Northl

175
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,036
The King in the Northl

176
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,596
The King in the Northl
The King in the Northl

177
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,193
The King in the Northl

178
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,108
The King in the Northl
The King in the Northl

179
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,991
The King in the Northl

180
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:44,907
The King in the Northl
The King in the Northl

181
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,553
The King in the Northl

182
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,190
- Lady Stark
- I want to see him.

183
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,793
Nowl

184
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,353
(Prisoners coughing)

185
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,273
Leave us.

186
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,278
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

187
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,037
Widowhood bwomes you.

188
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,630
Your bed must be lonely.

189
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,477
Is that why you came?

190
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:38,070
I'm not at my best,
but I think I could be of service.

191
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,789
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if I'm up to it.

192
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,355
(Groans)

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,912
Oh, I do like a violent woman.

194
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,749
I will kill you tonight, ser...

195
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,474
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

196
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,953
Let me show you how...

197
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,355
Hit me again, over the ear.

198
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,270
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look It shouldn't take long.

199
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,870
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

200
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,069
But I don't, my lady.

201
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,271
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

202
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,790
Because you are going
to the deepest of the seven hells,

203
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,957
- ifthe gods are just.
- What gods are those?

204
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:23,958
The trees your husband prayed to?

205
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,117
Where were the trees
when his head was getting chopped oﬂ?

206
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,834
If your gods are real and ifthey are just...

207
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,995
why is the world so full of injustice?

208
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:37,078
Because of men like you.

209
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,469
There are no men like me.

210
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,511
Only me.

211
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,714
My son Bran.

212
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,115
How did he come to fall from that tower?

213
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,679
I pushed him out the window.

214
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,433
Why?

215
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,798
l...hoped the fall would kill him.

216
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,233
Why?

217
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,190
You should get some sleep.

218
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,390
It's going to be a long war.

219
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,629
I can't believe we're actually at war.

220
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,799
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

221
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,390
What does it say?

222
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,874
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

223
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,189
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

224
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,231
Get back into bed.

225
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,792
They have my son.

226
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:17,478
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

227
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,716
I've heard his wolf killed a dozen men
and as many horses.

228
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,358
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?

229
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:25,039
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

230
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,514
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

231
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,351
It's a catastrophe.

232
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,231
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

233
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,314
(Goblet shatters)

234
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,151
There's your peace.

235
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,795
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Starks head.

236
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,910
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

237
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,917
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

238
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,353
He's winning...

239
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:53,472
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- I'm told we still have his sisters.

240
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,835
The ﬁrst order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

241
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:59,031
No truces. We can't afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

242
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,276
First we must return to Oasterly Rock
to raise...

243
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,708
They have my sonl

244
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,236
Get out, all of you.

245
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,435
Not you.

246
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,430
You were right about Eddard Stark.

247
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,190
If he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

248
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,519
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

249
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:53,392
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

250
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,193
| always thought you were a stunted fool.

251
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,830
Perhaps I was wrong.

252
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,557
Half wrong.

253
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,307
Unless we want to be surrounded
by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

254
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,994
No one will stay here.

255
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,633
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

256
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,638
and set the Riverland on ﬁre
from God's Eye to the Red Fork

257
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,638
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

258
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,830
And you will go to King's Landing.

259
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,189
- And do what?
- Rule.

260
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,312
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

261
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,477
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

262
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:43,075
And ifyou get so much as a whiffoftreason
from any ofthe rest -

263
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,078
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

264
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,629
Why not anyone? Why me?

265
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,989
You're my son.

266
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,350
Oh, one more thing.

267
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,591
You will not take that whore to court.

268
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,311
Do you understand?

269
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,357
(Animals calling)

270
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,753
Ser Jorah?

271
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,631
Gently, gently.

272
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,998
My son...

273
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,354
Where is he? I want him.

274
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,599
Where is he?

275
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,710
The boy did not live.

276
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:59,192
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

277
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,475
How did my son die?

278
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,873
He never lived, my princess.

279
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,392
The women say...

280
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,556
What do the women say?

281
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,831
- They say the child was...
- (Mirri) Monstrous, twisted.

282
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:18,756
I pulled him out myself.

283
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,709
He was scaled like a l'rd,

284
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,878
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

285
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,911
When I touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

286
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,629
lnside...he was full of graveworrns.

287
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:40,318
I warned you that only death
can pay for life.

288
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,237
You knew the price.

289
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,110
Where is Khal Drogo?

290
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,195
Show him to me.

291
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,474
Show me what I bought with my son's life.

292
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,476
As you command, lady.

293
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,875
Come. I will take you to him.

294
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,673
- Time enough for that later...
-lwanttoseehim now.

295
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,917
The khalasar is gone.

296
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,634
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

297
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:23,273
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

298
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,151
I'm sorry, my Princess.

299
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,828
Drogol

300
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,112
My sun and stars.

301
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:43,831
Why is he out here alone?

302
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,678
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

303
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:52,471
(Mirl'i) He lives.

304
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,477
You asked for life, you paid for life.

305
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,636
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

306
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:01,671
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east.

307
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,510
When the seas go dry. When the mountains
blow in the wind like leaves.

308
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,674
Leave us.

309
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,235
I don't want you alone with this sorceress.

310
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,396
l have nothing more to fear
from this woman.

311
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:32,352
Go.

312
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,069
You knew what I was buying
and you knew the price.

313
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,677
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.

314
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,156
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work

315
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,113
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

316
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,072
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

317
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,193
Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

318
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,629
(Daenerys) I spoke for you.

319
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,672
- I saved you.
- (Chuckles) Saved me?

320
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:09,156
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

321
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,393
I saw my god's house burn,

322
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,834
there where I had healed men and women
beyond counting.

323
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:21,154
In the streets I saw piles of heads...

324
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,510
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

325
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:27,757
the head of a young boy that I had
cured of fever just three moons past.

326
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,829
So...tell me again
unctly what it was that you saved?

327
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,790
Your life.

328
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,148
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

329
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,678
Then you will see unctly
what life is worth...

330
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,359
when all the rest has gone.

331
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,113
You can'tl

332
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,879
Get out of my way, Sam.

333
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:04,796
They'll put out the word.

334
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,310
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

335
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:11,158
Do you know what happens to deserters?

336
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,152
Better than you do.

337
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,671
What are you going to do?

338
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,630
I'm gonna ﬁnd my brother

339
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,433
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

340
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,830
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

341
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:30,552
- Move.
- I won't let you go.

342
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,230
- Move.
- No.

343
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,712
- Hyahl
- (Neighs)

344
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,158
(Grunts)

345
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:52,799
Hand of the King?

346
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,911
So it would seem.

347
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,237
And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?

348
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,868
No, he said I couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.

349
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:05,628
- He was very speciﬁc on that point.
- He knew my name?

350
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:07,275
What?

351
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:09,867
He said,
"Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?

352
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,716
I believe he used the word "whore".

353
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,757
Are you ashamed of me?

354
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,831
Are you afraid that I'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?

355
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,438
(Chuckles)

356
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,668
l'm funny nom

357
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,836
l'm Shae, the funny whore.

358
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,919
My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.

359
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,439
Certainly the richest.

360
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,869
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

361
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,676
Everyone everywhere always has to do
acctly what my father says.

362
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,952
He's always been a cunt.

363
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,911
I believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal

364
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,678
from a girl like you.

365
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:57,758
Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?

366
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,276
Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...

367
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,029
I know what a Hand needs.

368
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,236
(Ghost barks)
(Men shouting)

369
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:22,274
Ghost?

370
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,434
(Man) Hyahl

371
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,790
Hyahl Hyahl

372
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,075
Hyahl

373
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,674
(Shrieks)

374
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,230
(Neighs)

375
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,838
Sanrwelll

376
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,668
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

377
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,312
(Sanrwell) Did we get him?

378
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,152
(Grenn) Come on, help me get him up.

379
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,438
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

380
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,315
We're taking you back to where you belong.

381
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,874
- I belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

382
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,752
They'll kill you ifthey ﬁnd out you've gone.

383
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,034
They'll kill you ifthey know
you came after me.

384
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,071
- Go back
- Sam told us everything.

385
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,668
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

386
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,030
You took the oath. You can't leave.

387
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,071
- l have to.
- You can't.

388
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,434
- You said the words.
- I don't car'e about...

389
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,551
"Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow..."

390
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,719
- To hell with all of you.
- "Night gathers and now my watch begins.

391
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:21,837
"It shall not end until my death.

392
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,836
"I shall live and die at my post."

393
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,597
"I am the sword in the darkness..."

394
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,398
"The watcher on the walls..."

395
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,028
(All) "The shield that guards the realms of men.

396
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,629
"I pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

397
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,274
"for this night and all nights to come."

398
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,839
(Water spatters)

399
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,432
Do you remember
our ﬁrst ride, my sun and stars?

400
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,752
If you are in there, if you haven't gone away,
show me.

401
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:34,915
You're a ﬁghter.
You've always been a ﬁghter.

402
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,194
I need you to ﬁght now.

403
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,712
I know you're very far away,

404
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:55,435
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

405
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,154
(In English) When the sun...

406
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:21,628
rises in the west...

407
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,989
..and sets in the east...

408
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,875
(SON)

409
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,352
..then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.

410
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,996
(Sobbing)

411
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:37,432
Kings? (Chuckles)

412
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,068
Oh, I can tell you all there is
to know about kings.

413
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,997
The thing you need to understand
about kings is...

414
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:55,393
For the past 67 years, I've known...

415
00:32:55,479 --> 00:33:00,155
truly known...
more kings than any man alive.

416
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,997
They're complicated men,
but I know how to serve them.

417
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,956
(Chuckles) Yes.

418
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,349
And keep on serving them. (Coughs)

419
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,671
Aerys Targaryen.

420
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,832
Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...

421
00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:23,995
madness is the worst.

422
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,910
He was a good man.

423
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,916
Such a charmer.

424
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:33,467
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

425
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,718
consumed by dreams of ﬁre and blood...

426
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,194
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely different animal -

427
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,880
powerful man, great warrior -

428
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,710
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

429
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,995
are rather different things.

430
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,512
They say that...

431
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,955
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

432
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:06,199
he can often be blind
to the enemies at his side. (Chuckles)

433
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:10,674
(Coughs) Now I serve his son...

434
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,072
King Joffrey...

435
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,630
may the gods bless his reign.

436
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:20,793
He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.

437
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,879
Stern.

438
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,111
But stemness in defence of the realm
is no vice.

439
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,797
(Coughs)

440
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,879
It's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...

441
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,791
I sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.

442
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:40,432
Mmm. (Coughs)

443
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,755
True greatness.

444
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,796
So what's the thing?

445
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,072
What thing?

446
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,871
About kings.

447
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:57,628
You said, "The thing you
need to understand about kings..."

448
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,550
What? Things? What?

449
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,597
When you started, you...
Never mind.

450
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,030
(Mutters) Let me see you out, my dear.

451
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,992
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

452
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,075
Till the next time.

453
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,717
(Door closes)

454
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,788
(Sighs)

455
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,273
Right.

456
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,032
(Muttering)

457
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,039
(Groans)

458
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:00,677
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

459
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:02,997
Does the crown ﬁt?

460
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,230
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

461
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,193
the ones who sneered at you for years?

462
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,517
It's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.

463
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,950
A man with great ambition and no morals -

464
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,548
I wouldn't bet against you.

465
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:23,348
And what would you do, my ﬁiend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?

466
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:26,755
I must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.

467
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,236
You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.

468
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,872
Oh, you can do better than that.

469
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,516
When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?

470
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,357
- I've always wondered.
- Have you?

471
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,517
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

472
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,508
I picture...a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?

473
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,358
I am ﬂattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

474
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,109
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

475
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,915
a man from another land,

476
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,235
despised by most,

477
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,548
feared by all...

478
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,192
Am I? That is good to know.

479
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,517
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

480
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,591
But you car'ry on...

481
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,598
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

482
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:17,471
I admire you.

483
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,717
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.

484
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,071
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for beﬁiending powerful men...

485
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,077
- and women.
- A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree.

486
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:32,231


487
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,316
here we stand...

488
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,794
in mutual admiration and respect.

489
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,836
Playing our roles.

490
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,234
Serving a new king.

491
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,550
Long may he reign.

492
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,711
- My king.
- My king.

493
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,958
My lords. Shall we begin?

494
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,792
(Yoren) You're Arry now, hear me?

495
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,757
Arry the orphan boy.

496
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,317
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

497
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,191
What's your name?

498
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,435
Arry.

499
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:04,995
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

500
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,109
I've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

501
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,349
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

502
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:15,591
and I didn't ﬁnd no little Iordlings
down there.

503
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,948
This lot -

504
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,788
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

505
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:24,798
And the other half would do the same,
aaept they'd rape you ﬁrst.

506
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:29,271
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

507
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,829
You stay with this lot, boy.

508
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,392
And stay...

509
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,035
or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

510
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,118
Watch yourself, midget.

511
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,754
He's got a sword, this one.

512
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,314
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

513
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,273
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

514
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,878
He looks like a girl.

515
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,990
I bet he stole that sword.

516
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,355
Let's have a look

517
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,716
I could use me a sword like that.

518
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,069
- Take it off him.
- Give it here, midget.

519
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,838
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

520
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,712
I've seen him kick a boy to death.

521
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,916
I knocked him down
and I kicked him in the balls

522
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,195
and I kept kicking him
until he was dead.

523
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,038
I kicked him all to pimes.

524
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,478
- You better give me that swordl
- You want it?

525
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,192
I'll give it to you.

526
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,839
I already killed one fat boy.

527
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,235
I bet you never killed anyone.

528
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,954
I bet you're a liar. But I'm not.

529
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,876
I'm good at killing fat boys.

530
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:33,551
I like killing fat boys.

531
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,351
(GBSPS)

532
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:37,549
Like picking on the little ones, do you?

533
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,278
I've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

534
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,629
When I hit that steel, it sings.

535
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,389
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?

536
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,910
This is castle-forged steel.

537
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,036
Where'd you steal it?

538
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:58,753
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

539
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,149
Where we're going,
they don't car'e what you've done.

540
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:04,476
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

541
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,953
murderers.

542
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,276
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

543
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:14,194
But my master got sick of me, so...
here I am.

544
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:17,316
(Yoren) Come on, you sorry sons of whoresl

545
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,552
It's a thousand leagues from here
to the Walll

546
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,988
And winter is comingl

547
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,471
Ham.

548
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,230
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

549
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,996
Bring me some beer at least.

550
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,871
You look exhausted.

551
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,910
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

552
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,272
Don't look so terriﬁed.

553
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,867
If we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

554
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,593
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

555
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:21,913
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

556
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,552
Honour made you leave,

557
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,317
honour brought you back

558
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,196
My ﬁiends brought me back

559
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,150
I didn't say it was your honour.

560
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,716
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

561
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,876
No? Good.

562
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,594
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

563
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,156
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

564
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,192
At night they see ﬁres
blazing in the mountains

565
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,356
from dusk until dawn.

566
00:41:52,439 --> 00:41:56,751
A ptcaured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

567
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,236
to what ends the gods only know.

568
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,514
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

569
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,789
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

570
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,793
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

571
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,193
Do you think your brothers war
is more important than ours?

572
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:19,434
No.

573
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,194
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

574
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,029
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

575
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,070
- No.
- Good.

576
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,753
Because I want you
and your wolf with us

577
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,638
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

578
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,230
Beyond the Wall?

579
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:41,271
I'll not sit meeldy by...
and wait for the snows.

580
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:44,155
I mean to ﬁnd out what's happening.

581
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,071
The Night's Watch will ride in force

582
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,193
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

583
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,793
(Men shouting)

584
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:56,353
(Morrnont) And we will ﬁnd Benjen Stark.

585
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:57,958
alive or dead.

586
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,990
I will command them myself.

587
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,508
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

588
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:06,389
(Man) Move outl

589
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:08,993
(Morrnont) ..are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

590
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,555
ora bastard boy
who wantsto play atwar?

591
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,828
Is this your command, Khaleesi?

592
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:56,950
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

593
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,949
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

594
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,036
They were not given to me to sell.

595
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:12,269
Khaleesi, my Oueen...

596
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,714
I vowto serve you, obey you,

597
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,637
to die for you if need be...

598
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:20,914
but let him go, Khaleesi.

599
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:23,109
I know what you intend. Do not.

600
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,832
I must.

601
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,950
(Sighs) You don't understand...

602
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,834
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

603
00:44:31,959 --> 00:44:33,631
I won't watch you burn.

604
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,150
Is that what you fear?

605
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,749
You will be my khalasar.

606
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,794
I see the faces of slaves.

607
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,199
Ifreeyou.

608
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,038
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

609
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:10,592
But ifyou stay...

610
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,030
it will be as brothers and sisters,

611
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:17,309
as husbands and wives.

612
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:25,267
(Chuckles softly)

613
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:30,948
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

614
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,352
You swore to obey me.

615
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,358
(Grunting)

616
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,839
I am Daenerys Storrnbom...

617
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:49,629
of House Targaryen...

618
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,557
of the blood of old Valyria.

619
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,319
I am the Dragon's Daughter.

620
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:56,669
And I swearto you...

621
00:45:56,759 --> 00:46:00,354
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

622
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:03,039
- You will not hear me scream.
- I will.

623
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:07,670
But it is not your screams I want.

624
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:10,632
Only your life.

625
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,751
(Singing)

626
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,158
(Wailing)

627
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,556
(Screaming continues)

628
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,672
(Chirruping)

629
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:26,747
(Soft snarls)

630
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,758
Blood of my blood.

631
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,352
(Hisses)

632
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,239
(Hisses)

633
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,269
(Shrieking)

634
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:19,796
(Shrieking continues)
