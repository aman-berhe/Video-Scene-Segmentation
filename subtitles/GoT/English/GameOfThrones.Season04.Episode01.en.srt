There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

353
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,878
lam in your debt, Maester beurn.

354
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:02,554
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help whenever I can.

(DOOR OPENS)

356
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,997
-Odd little man.
-|'ve grown fond of him.

(DOOR CLOSES)

358
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,799
He's quite talented.

359
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:18,312
-What symptoms?
-(CHUCKLES)

360
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,236
Symptoms that are not your concern.

361
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,356
You let him touch you?

362
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,317
You jealous?

363
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,628
I'm surprised.

364
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,072
You never let Pycelle near you.

365
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,154
(LAUGHS) You think I'd let that old lecher
put his hands on me?

366
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,992
He smells like a dead cat.

367
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,388
I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.

368
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,310
Well, they smell like Pycelle.

369
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,709
You drink more than you used to.

370
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,192
-Yes.
-Why?

371
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,554
Hmm. Let's see.

372
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,038
You started a brawl in the streets with
Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital.

373
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,553
My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.

374
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,232
It must have been traumatic for you.

375
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,673
My only daughter was shipped offto Dorne.

376
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,034
We suffered through a siege.

377
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,313
A rather short siege.

378
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:01,038
That I didn't expect to survive.

379
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,636
And now I'm marrying my eldest son
to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden,

380
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:09,837
while I'm supposed to marry her brother,
a renowned pillow-biter. So...

381
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,229
Father disowned me today.

382
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,595
He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

383
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,591
-You're forgetting Tyrion.
-(SCOFFS)

384
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,795
You don't really plan on staying
in the Kingsguard, do you?

385
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:29,507
Staying in the Kingsguard means
I live right here in the Red Keep with you.

386
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,031
-Not now.
-I want...

387
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,997
Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

388
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,714
-Something's changed.
-Everything's changed.

389
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,998
You come back after all this time
with no apologies and one hand

390
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,956
and expect everything to be the same?

391
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,109
What do you want me to apologise for?

392
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,235
For leaving me.

393
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:51,832
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

394
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,716
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

395
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,798
You left me alone.

396
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,470
Every day l was a prisoner,
l plotted my escape.

397
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,708
Every day.

398
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,949
l murdered people
so I could be here with you.

399
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,836
-You tooktoo long.
-|...

400
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:09,439

-You tooktoo long.

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,352
-Come in.
-JA|ME: Go away.

403

Forgive me, Your Grace.

404
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,512
You told me to come at once
ifthere was anything important.

(BLOWING)

406
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:40,277
You plan on killing all the crows yourself?

407
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,150
Do you plan on sitting here,
scratching your balls till winter?

408
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,278
We wait for Mance's orders.

409
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,236
You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon.

410
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,151
If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

411
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,514
And what is it you want?

412
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,634
March on Castle Black with just this lot?

413
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,949
Your pretty crow said
athousand men are nesting there.

414
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,518
He's a liar.

415
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,714
He is?

416
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,272
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

417
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,113
You said you put three arrows in him.

418
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,315
Idid.

419
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,236
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

420
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,120
lfthat boy's still walking,

421
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,269

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,747
You came from the south, not the north.

429
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,471
Took a detour.

430
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,393
Got some supper
from a village down that way.

431
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,275
Why does the meat down here
taste so much better

432
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,236
than it does on our side ofthe Wall?

Fat and lazy.

437
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,748
Easier for us. (CHUCKLES)

Not like those crows at Castle Black.

448

Think ofthem stuck in their larders,

stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

450

and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

I know we've had our differences, Tormund,

452

453
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,791

he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.

you'll be all in black."

460
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:06,037
The way my father looked at him,
I wanted that.

461
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,754
He was better than me at everything.

462
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,754
Fighting and hunting

463
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:15,753
and riding

464
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,233
and girls.

465
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,675
Gods, the girls loved him.

lwanted to hate him, but I never could.

467
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,116
Sometimes I want to hate you.

468
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:35,357
You're better than me at everything.

469
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,989
Except reading.

00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,074

They're ready foryou.

472
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,747
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

473
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,309
No one's going to hang you.
You've done nothing wrong.

474
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,231
I've done plenty wrong.

475
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,119
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

476
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:04,833
-JON: I didn't murder him.
-No?

477
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,798
You put your sword
through a brother ofthe Night's Watch.

478
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,711
What do you call that?

479
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,912
He wanted me to kill him.

480
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,672
A bastard son of a traitor.
What would you expect?

481
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,867
The Halfhand believed our only chance to
stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

482
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,072
Don't talk about the Halfhand
as ifyou knew him. He was my brother.

483
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,829
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

484
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,473
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

JANOS: The free folk? Listen to him.

486
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,877

Aye, | talk like awildling.
late with the wildlings.

488
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,358
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. l...

489
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,354
I laid with awildling girl.

490
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,838
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

491
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,388
I do.

492
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,108
The law is the law.

493
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,192
The boy must die.

494
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,955
lfwe beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

495
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,431
the Wall would be manned by headless men.

496
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,559
There's a difference between
sneaking offto the Mole's Town brothel

497
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,676
and sleeping with the enemy.

498
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,755
While we sit here
debating which rules I broke,

499
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,397
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

500
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,318
Impossible.

501
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,516
You can't get 50 wildlings together
before they start killing each other.

502
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,748
100,000.

503
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,437
He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots,
the ice-river clans.

504
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:23,793
He has giants fighting for him.

505
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,028
(LAUGHS) Giants?

506
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,077
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

507
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,469
l commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

508
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,549
And now you're here.

509
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:33,913
You must not have been
very good at yourjob.

510
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,429
How dare you?

511
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,912
There's a band of wildlings south ofthe Wall
already, led by Tormund Giantsbane.

512
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,229
I killed theirwarg and three others.

513
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,356
They shot me full of arrows.

514
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,194
Their orders are to attack Castle Black from
the south when Mance hits it from the north.

515
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,952
The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.

516
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,713
Mance said it would be the greatest fire
the North has ever seen.

517
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,117
That's the truth.

518
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,032
All the truth.

519
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,590
Do you intend to execute me,
or am | free to go?

520
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,911
None of us are free.

521
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:11,637
We are men ofthe Night's Watch.

522
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,708
But we won't be taking your head today,
Jon Snow.

523
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,108
Go on.

524
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,950
lam acting commander here, MaesterAemon.

525
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,349
Yes, you are.

526
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:33,589
