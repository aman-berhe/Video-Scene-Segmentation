1
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,078
(Bells chiming, birds singing)

2
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,311
(Horse whinnies)

3
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,511
(Men shouting)

4
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,314
(Ned) Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

5
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,872
No.

6
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,753
I stood vigil
for him myself last night.

7
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,630
He had no one else.

8
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,439
He'd never worn this armour before.

9
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,314
Bad luck for him -
going against the Mountain.

10
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,556
Who determines the draw”

11
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,715
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

12
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,558
Aye.

13
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,750
But who holds the straws?

14
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,829
You've done good work. Sisters.

15
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,270
Life is strange.

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,676
Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

17
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,598
I'm glad we never met
on the ﬁeld, Ser Barrislan.

18
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,791
As is my wife. I don‘t think
the widovfs life would suit her.

19
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,036
(Chuckles) You're too modest.

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,549
I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

21
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:11,069
My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

22
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,998
I never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.

23
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,031
He was a ﬁne man, your father.

24
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,110
What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.

25
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,753
And that lad -

26
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,791
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

27
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,798
How could he afford a new suit of armour?

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,150
Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

29
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,394
- I hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

30
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,113
(Chuckles) Robert tends
to do what he wants.

31
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,629
If the king got what
he wanted all the time,

32
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,877
It's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

33
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,593
Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.

34
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,630
Did you know that?

35
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,949
Look at this idiotl
One ball and no brains.

36
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,752
He can't even put
a man's armour on him properly.

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,593
- You're too fat for your armour.
- Fat?

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,073
Fat, is it?

39
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,475
Is that how you speak to your king?

40
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,308
(Laughing)

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,118
Oh, it's funny, is it?

42
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,909
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,275
You don't like the Hand's joke?

44
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,597
You're torturing the poor boy.

45
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,280
You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armour.

46
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,197
Go ﬁnd the breastplate
stretcher - nowl

47
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,308
- (Laughs)
- "The breastplate stretcher"?

48
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,470
How long before he ﬁgures it out?

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,592
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All ﬁght, all right.

50
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,553
You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.

51
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,194
You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

52
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,516
Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit someny

53
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,675
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

54
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,559
- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.

55
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,918
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.

56
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,234
Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?

57
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,958
Aye.

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,477
- Drink
- I'm not thirsty.

59
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,830
Drink Your king commands it.

60
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,398
Gods,

61
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,875
too fat for my armour.

62
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,274
Your squire -
a Lannister boy?

63
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,754
Mm. A bloody idiot,

64
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,757
but Cersei insisted.

65
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,109
l have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

66
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,993
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he told me.

67
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,679
"You'll need her father on your side."

68
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:46,393
I thought being king
meant I could do whatever I wanted.

69
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,310
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em r'ide.

70
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,000
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

71
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,030
- Robert.
- What?

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,598
Oh. (Laughs)

73
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,188
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

74
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,038
Come, bow before your kingl
Bow, you shitsl

75
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,071
(Ned chuckles)

76
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,157
(Cheering)

77
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,393
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

78
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,634
The Knight of the Flowers.

79
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,390
Thank you, Ser Loras.

80
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,832
(Horse neighs)

81
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,917
(Crowd jeering)

82
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,354
(Horse grunting and neighing)

83
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,799
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

84
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,479
- Hey.
- I can't watch.

85
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,316
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

86
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,988
- I'll take that bet.
- Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?

87
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:20,070
A dozen barrels of Domish wine?

88
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:23,071
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

89
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,909
- Or you could even buy a ﬁiend.
- He's going to die.

90
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,792
Ser Loras r'ides well.

91
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,152
(Neighing)

92
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,750
(Fanfare)

93
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,758
- (Gasm)
- (Laughs)

94
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,756
Such a shame, Littleﬁnger.

95
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,951
It would have been so nice
for you to have a ﬁiend.

96
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,877
And tell me, Lord Renly,

97
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,229
when will you be having your ﬁiend?

98
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,596
(Neighs)

99
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,916
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.

100
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,237
Ser Loras would never do that.

101
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:27,113
- There's no honour in tricks.
- No honour and quite a bit of gold.

102
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,190
- (Helmet clanks)
- Swordl

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,111
(Horse neighs)

104
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,828
- (Gasm)
- (Neighs)

105
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,911
- (CFOWd gasps)
- (Grunts)

106
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,676
Leave him bel

107
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,951
(Growls)

108
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,835
Stop this madness
in the name of your kingl

109
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,715
(Robert) Let him gol

110
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,951
I owe you my life, ser.

111
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,150
I'm no ser.

112
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,597
(Cheering)

113
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,630
(Grunting)

114
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,357
Remove his hood.

115
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,438
J' On that eve, the captive lmp

116
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,910
J' Downwards from his horse did limp

117
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,998
J' No more would he preen and primp

118
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:16,632
J' In garb of red and gold I

119
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,272
(T yrion) This isn't the Kingsroad.

120
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,074
- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- I did... Often and loudly.

121
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,636
Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,

122
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,670
looking for me in the wrong place.

123
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,593
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

124
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:33,108
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

125
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,272
Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.

126
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,634
Would you be so good as to untie me?

127
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,957
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

128
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,276
Am I going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

129
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,912
Unless a shadowcat ate me ﬁrst.

130
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,873
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

131
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,472
Ah, the eastern road.

132
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,431
We're going to the Vale.

133
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,034
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

134
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,954
Tell me, Lady Stark.
when was the last time you saw your sister?

135
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,588
- Five years ago.
- She's changed.

136
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,109
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

137
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:14,276
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I.

138
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,674
I had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.

139
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,512
- The dagger found...
- What sort of imbecile

140
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,232
arms an assassin with his own blade?

141
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,391
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

142
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,311
Am I starting to make sense?

143
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,112
- (T huds, grunts)
- (Catelyn) Rodrikl

144
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:28,831
(Roaring)

145
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,357
My lady, this way.

146
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,197
Untie me.

147
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,118
If I die, what's the point?

148
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,311
(Neighs)

149
00:11:58,439 --> 00:11:59,554
Ahl

150
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,751
(Man roars)

151
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:40,911
(Breathing heavily)

152
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,559
- Rodrik?
- I'll be ﬁne, my lady.

153
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:47,549
There's no need to bloody yourself.

154
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,795
Your ﬁrst?

155
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,868
You need a woman.

156
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,030
Nothing like a woman after a ﬁght.

157
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,911
I'm willing if she is.

158
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,076
(Laughing)

159
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,837


160
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,511
(Bran) The Iron Islands.
Sigil - a kraken.

161
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,670
Words - 'We do not sow."

162
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,790
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

163
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,071
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

164
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,712
(Laughs)

165
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,831
And failed rebellions.

166
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,998
Sigil - a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

167
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:37,997
- Good.
- Words - "Ours is the fury."

168
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,553
- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

169
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,476
The Westerlands.

170
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,591
- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

171
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,598
- Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
- No.

172
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,958
A common saying,
but not their ofﬁcial motto.

173
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,990
- (Arrow thunks)
- Lords - the Lannisters.

174
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,872
- We're still on their words.
- I don't know them.

175
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,830
You do know them. Think

176
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,315
"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."

177
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,999
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

178
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:06,429
- House Homwood.
- "Family, duty, honour."

179
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,390
Those are Tully words -
your mother's.

180
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,910
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honour...

181
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,156
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

182
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,191
Family comes ﬁrst?

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,390
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

184
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,835
How can she protect the family

185
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,190
if she's not with her family?

186
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,396
Your mother sat by your bed

187
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,114
for three weeks while you slept.

188
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:33,230
And then she leftl

189
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,798
When you were born, I was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

190
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,709
I placed you in her arms.

191
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,469
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

192
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,873
she will love you.

193
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,598
Absolutely.

194
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,472
(Sighs) I still can't tell you,

195
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,955
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now

196
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,638
- (Arrow thunks)
- Today?

197
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,273
- No, I don't.
- Then how can you promise me

198
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,350
she'll be home soon?

199
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,516
Sometimes I worry
you're too smart for your own good.

200
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,915
I'll never shoot another arrow.

201
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,276
And where is that written?

202
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,913
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

203
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,395
If the saddle Lord Tyr'ion
designed actually works,

204
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,874
you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback

205
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,631
Really?

206
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,034
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

207
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,070
Why shouldn't you?

208
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:37,997
(Grunting)

209
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,114
(Moans)

210
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,555
Shh, keep it down.

211
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,029
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

212
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,277
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

213
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,589
Important enough for the likes of you.

214
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,868
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

215
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,309
Who, the Imp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.

216
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,276
Jealous?

217
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:07,077
Why should I be jealous?

218
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,997
Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

219
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,029
What's a dwarf like down below?

220
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,150
I've always wondered.

221
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,238
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

222
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:22,318
He's good with his ﬁngers too.
And his tongue.

223
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,230
Generous tipper.

224
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,919
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

225
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,831
You are jealous.

226
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,512
I'm a Greyjoy.

227
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,676
We've been lords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

228
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,478
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

229
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,431
not even the Lannisters.

230
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,470
And what about the Starks?

231
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,554
I've been Lord Starks ward
since I was eight years old.

232
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,910
A ward -
that's a nice word for it.

233
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,759
Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...

234
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,916
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

235
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,515
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

236
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,073
You're a very serious boy.

237
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,197
- I'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

238
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,998
A serious boy
with a serious cock

239
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,349
I don't want to pay for it.

240
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,994
Then get yourself a wife.

241
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,315
- (Arya) Come on.
- (Meows)

242
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:21,754
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- (Meows)

243
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,032
(Meows)

244
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:31,028
How is your son, my lord?

245
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,790
He'll never walk again.

246
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,630
But his mind is sound?

247
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,470
So they say.

248
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,596
A blessing, then.

249
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,711
I suffered an early mutilation myself.

250
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,954
Some doors close forever...

251
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,035
others open
in most unexpected places.

252
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,838
May I?

253
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,998
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

254
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,155
off comes my head.

255
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,713
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

256
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,309
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

257
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,759
But there are things you must know.

258
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,077
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,796
your ﬁiend, I know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.

260
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,313
I've been in the capital a month.

261
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,033
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

262
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,838
I didn't trust you.

263
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,234
So why do you trust me now

264
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,954
The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

265
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,115
There are few men of honour
in the capital.

266
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,872
You are one of them.

267
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,753
I would like to believe I am another,
strange as that may seem.

268
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:49,313
What sort of doom does the king face?

269
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,039
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

270
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,949
The tears of lys, they call it.

271
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,309
A rare and costly thing,

272
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,750
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

273
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,398
Who gave it to him?

274
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,472
Some dear ﬁiend, no doubt.
But which one?

275
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,638
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

276
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,795
(Sighs) There was one boy.

277
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,353
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

278
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,310
The squire, Ser Hugh?

279
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,150
Pity, what happened to him,

280
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,271
just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.

281
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,314
If Ser Hugh poisoned him...

282
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,709
who paid Ser Hugh?

283
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,958
- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

284
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,429
He was Hand for 17 years -
17 good years.

285
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,311
Why kill him?

286
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,351
He started asking questions.

287
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,028
(Meows)

288
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,393
(Man) He's found
one bastard already.

289
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,592
He has the book

290
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,550
- The rest will come.
- (Lock clicks)

291
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,875
(Man #2) And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

292
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,638
(Man #1) The gods alone know.

293
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,637
The fools tried to kill his son.

294
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,354
What's worse -
they botched it.

295
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:45,358
The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

296
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,077
- We will be at war soon, my ﬁiend.
- (Man #2) What good is war nom

297
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,116
We're not ready.

298
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,707
If one Hand can die,
why not a smond?

299
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,307
(Man #1) This Hand is not the other.

300
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,919
(Man #2) We need time.

301
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,032
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

302
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,397
- You know what these savages are.
- "Delay," you say.

303
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,390
"Move fast," I reply.

304
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:09,630
This is no longer
a game for two players.

305
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,710
(Man #2) It never was.

306
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,351
The ﬁrst to arrive
and the last to leave.

307
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,869
I admire your industry.

308
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,468
You do move quietly.

309
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,994
We all have our qualities.

310
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,918
You look a bit lonely today.

311
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,270
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

312
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,709
- First boy is on the house.
- I think you're mistaking

313
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,592
- business with pleasure.
- Am I?

314
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,154
All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty little things.

315
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,550
Trust me,

316
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,189
we awommodate all inclinations.

317
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,119
Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, I hear.

318
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,836
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -
both equally important.

319
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:18,430
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

320
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,792
Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

321
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,519
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

322
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:28,915
And I heard the most awful rumour
about a certain lord

323
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,951
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

324
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:35,075
Must be enormously difﬁcult
to awommodate that inclination.

325
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,031
The logistics alone...

326
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,277
to ﬁnd beautiful corpses
before they rot.

327
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,313
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in awordance with the king's laws.

328
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,715
Strictly speaking.

329
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,111
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

330
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,510
I've often wondered.

331
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,597
Do you know,
I have no idea where they are.

332
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:04,268
- And we had been so close.
- (Chuckles)

333
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,992
But enough about me.
How have you been

334
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,116
since we last saw each other?

335
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:10,628
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

336
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,991
Now the last time I saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

337
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,759
-Sawmewithyourowneyes?
-Eyeslown.

338
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,312
Council business.

339
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,318
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark

340
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,195
Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Starks wife.

341
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,555
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

342
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,754
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

343
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:38,757
to think a simple word to the queen...

344
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,070
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

345
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,509
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you

346
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,477
even more mently
than you have seen me.

347
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,234
- Have you?
- Yes.

348
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,997
Earlier today, I distinctly mall

349
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,428
seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

350
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,596
Was that you under the bed?

351
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,550
And not long after that

352
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,194
when I saw you escorting a certain

353
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,234
foreign dignitary...

354
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,589
Council business?

355
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,791
Of course, you would have ﬁiends
from across the Narrow Sea.

356
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,353
You're from there yourself, after all.

357
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:13,516
We're ﬁiends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

358
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,751
I'd like to think we are.

359
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,949
So you can imagine my burden,

360
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,594
wondering ifthe king
might question my ﬁiend's sympathies.

361
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,514
To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a ﬁiend,

362
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,351
turning right loyalty to the realm...

363
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,670
- Oh, please.
- To ﬁnd myself in a position

364
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,636
- where a simple word to the king...
- (Door opens)

365
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,791
What are you two conspiring about?

366
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,069
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

367
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,072
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

368
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,953
Disturbing news from far away.

369
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,471
Hadn't you heard?

370
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,391
(Birds cawing, waves breaking)

371
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,231
Off with you. No begging.

372
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,156
I'm not a beggar.
I live here.

373
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,316
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

374
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,196
I want to see my father.

375
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,918
I want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

376
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,678
You want your father, boy?

377
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,713
He's lying on the ﬂoor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his ﬁiends.

378
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,148
My father is Hand of the Kingl

379
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,709
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.

380
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,075
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

381
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,033
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

382
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,515
on the ear to help with your hearing?

383
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,998
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

384
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,436
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

385
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,074
- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

386
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,911
- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya. (Sighs)

387
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:02,553
I'm not lyingl
They said you found the bastard

388
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,433
and the wolves are ﬁghting
the lions and the savage...

389
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,198
Something about the savage.

390
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,515
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

391
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:12,711
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

392
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,792
Chasing a cat.

393
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,150
(Knock. door opens)

394
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,473
Pardon, my lord.

395
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,716
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

396
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:32,233
- Your name, ﬁiend?
- Yoren, if it please.

397
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:36,232
- This must be your son. He has the look
- I'm a girll

398
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,873
Did Benjen send you?

399
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,833
No one sent me, my lord.
I'm here to ﬁnd men for the Wall,

400
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:45,349
see ifthere's any scum in the dungeons
that might be ﬁt for service.

401
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,948
- Oh, we'll ﬁnd recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

402
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,309
But that's not why I disturb you now.

403
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,272
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -

404
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,355
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

405
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,638
It's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.

406
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,358
There are others riding too.

407
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,870
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

408
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,229
Know what?

409
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,793
Best said in private, my lord.

410
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,112
Go on. We'll talk more later.

411
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:22,074
Jory, take her safely to her room.

412
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,509
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

413
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,875
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

414
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,468
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

415
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,193
No fear on that count, little lady.

416
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:47,950
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

417
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,916
She's taken the Imp.

418
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,268
(Neighs)

419
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,231
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

420
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,671
- To whom do I speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

421
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,798
- ls Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

422
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,989
May I ask. my lady,

423
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,837
why he is with you?

424
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,473
That's why there was no time.

425
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,113
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

426
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,316
My sister will decide what he looks like.

427
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,912
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

428
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,995
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

429
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,595
Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

430
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,835
I'll impregnate the bitch.

431
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,551
(T yrion) I like you.

432
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,911
Lord Stark. your presence
has been requested

433
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,235
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

434
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,350
I need to see the king ﬁrst - alone.

435
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,635
The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

436
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,636
He has summoned you.

437
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,512
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

438
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:17,153
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

439
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,393
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

440
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,794
I warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

441
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,433
I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

442
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,676
Well, hear it now.

443
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:32,107
I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

444
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,195
And that fool Viserys as well.

445
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,551
Is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.

446
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,069
You will dishonour yourself
forever if you do this.

447
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,636
Honour?l
I've got seven kingdoms to rulel

448
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:46,717
One king, seven kingdoms.

449
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,949
Do you think honour keeps them in line?

450
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,111
Do you think it's honour
that's keeping the peace?

451
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:55,437
- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

452
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,638
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

453
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,239
because the spider heard a rumour?

454
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,032
No rumour, my lord.
The princess is with child.

455
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,317
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Morrnont.

456
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,556
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

457
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,954
Morrnont?
You bring us the whispers

458
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,509
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

459
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,199
Jorah Morrnont's a slaver,
not a traitor.

460
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,550
Small difference, I know,
to an honourable man.

461
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,195
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, ﬁed our land.

462
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,231
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

463
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:29,829
(Robert) And if he's right?
If she has a son?

464
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:33,076
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

465
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:36,868
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

466
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:40,958
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

467
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,910
Do nothing?

468
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,235
That's your wise advice?

469
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,749
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

470
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,870
You're my council.
Counsell

471
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:54,514
Speak sense to this honourable fool.

472
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,349
I understand your misgivings, my lord.

473
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,913
Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing

474
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,950
we must consider, a vile thing.

475
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,235
Yet we who presume to rule

476
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,315
must sometimes do vile things

477
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,556
for the good of the realm.

478
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,871
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

479
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:16,674
- the realm will bleed.
- I bear this girl no ill will,

480
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,428
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

481
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,790
How many towns will burn?

482
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,992
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

483
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,109
that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?

484
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,674
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

485
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:35,955
When you ﬁnd yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

486
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,196
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

487
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,278
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

488
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,947
I followed you into war -

489
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,990
twice,

490
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,832
without doubts,

491
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,911
without swond thoughts.

492
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:59,675
But I will not follow you now.

493
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,551
The Robert I grew up with

494
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:05,995
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

495
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,711
She dies.

496
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,916
I will have no part in it.

497
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,110
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

498
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,590
You'll do as I command
or I'll ﬁnd me a Hand who will.

499
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,310
And good luck to him.

500
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,028
- I thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

501
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,752
I'm done with you.

502
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:38,757
Go, run back to Winterfelll

503
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:41,074
I'll have your head on a spikel

504
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:45,232
(Robert) I'll put it there myself, you fooll

505
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,157
You think you're too good for this?

506
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,078
Too proud and honourable?
This is a warl

507
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,791
I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

508
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,593
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

509
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,108
Lord Baelish is here for you.

510
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,670
His Grace went on about you
at some length

511
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,151
- What can I do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

512
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,032
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nighthll,

513
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,674
I'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

514
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,155
If that sort of thing still interests you.

515
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,758
I don't have the time.

516
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,791
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

517
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,076
Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

518
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:39,513
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

519
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,591
Find them and meet me at the stables.

520
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,748
You bring him here without permission?

521
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,554
You pollute my home with his presence?

522
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,399
(Sucking sounds)

523
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,718
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

524
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,278
You remember her, don't you?

525
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,512
Isn't he beautiful?

526
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:07,511
And strong too. Jon knew it.

527
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,352
His last words were
"The seed is strong."

528
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,828
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

529
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,348
his son would grow up to be.

530
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:18,471
Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

531
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,750
Lysa,

532
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,155
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

533
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,157
- warning me...
- To stay away from theml

534
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:28,713
Not to bring one herel

535
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,030
Mummy...

536
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,037
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

537
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,990
(Chuckles)

538
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,270
He's little.

539
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,476
(Lysa) He's Tyr'ion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

540
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,358
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the Kingl

541
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,835
Oh, did I kill him too?

542
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:50,872
- I've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tonguel

543
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,671
These men are knights of the Vale.

544
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,354
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

545
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:58,310
Every one of them would die for me.

546
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:01,715
If any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

547
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,593
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummyl

548
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,348
- Tell himl
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

549
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,714
He's just trying to ﬁighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

550
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:15,435
No one will hurt my baby.

551
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,152
Mummy...

552
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,560
I want to see the bad man ﬁy.

553
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:25,750
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

554
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:29,152
I will not have him harmed.

555
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,152
Ser Vardis,

556
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,915
my sister's guest is weary.

557
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,511
Take him down below
so he can rest.

558
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:40,390
Introduce him to Mord.

559
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:45,114
You go sleep, dwarf man. (Chuckles)

560
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,195
Sleep good, little dwarf manl

561
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,878
(Laughs)

562
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,069
(Slams, lock clunks)

563
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,950
(Wind whistling)

564
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,794
Lord Starks lucky he still has a head.

565
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:26,433
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

566
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,518
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

567
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,073
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.

568
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,589
(Scraping)

569
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,191
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

570
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,675
If you want hairless,
maybe you should ﬁnd a little boy.

571
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,711
I want you.

572
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:48,711
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

573
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,149
He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.

574
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,312
Oh, and you're not?

575
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,389
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

576
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,590
How many wars have you fought in?

577
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,830
Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armour of yours?

578
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,711
Hold still.

579
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,593
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how I'm not tough enough,

580
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,392
how I squirm at the sight of blood.

581
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,033
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

582
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,990
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socketl

583
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,593
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to ﬁght.

584
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:20,756
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

585
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,195
(Groans) It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

586
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,071
I'mgood bwauselworkatit-

587
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,838
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick

588
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,828
I could work at ﬁghting all day, every day,
I'd still never be as good as you.

589
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,269
Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.

590
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,318
(Sighs)

591
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,269
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

592
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,549
So how did it end up?

593
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,514
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

594
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,550
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

595
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,035
Every time he talks about killing her,
I swear the table rises six inches.

596
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,878
It's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

597
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,275
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

598
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,674
You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

599
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,917
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

600
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,553
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

601
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,594
- I have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

602
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:20,990
(Laughs) But a lot more than you.

603
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,273
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

604
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,310
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

605
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:28,748
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

606
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,792
all so he can stick his spear
into something's ﬁesh.

607
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:35,116
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

608
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,070
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

609
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,555
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

610
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,590
Andheusedtobegoodatit.

611
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,835
Do you know who should be king?

612
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:48,110
- Be serious.
- I am.

613
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,309
My father could be your bank

614
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:52,270
I've never fought in a war before,

615
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,993
- but I'd ﬁght for you.
- I'm fourth in line.

616
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,998
And where's Robert
in the line of royal suwession?

617
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,270
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

618
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:02,788
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

619
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,950
He's still my older brother.

620
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,396
- (Gasps) What are you doing?l
- Look at it.

621
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,555
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

622
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,874
Sometimes a little spills.

623
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:15,033
If you bmome king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

624
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:17,229
You need to get used to it.

625
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,271
Go on. Look

626
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,235
People love you.

627
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,594
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

628
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,070
They want to be near you.

629
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,918
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

630
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:37,069
but you don't gloat over it.

631
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,871
You don't love killing.

632
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:46,308
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

633
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,998
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

634
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,316
You would be a wonderful king.

635
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,630
(Kissing and sucking sounds)

636
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:10,318
(Door creaks)

637
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:16,596
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

638
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,232
You seemed so good together.

639
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,511
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

640
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:27,239
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pimes.

641
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,831
I suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

642
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,313
No.

643
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,350
He's not serious enough.

644
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:39,311
I'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

645
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,429
(Robert) Hmm.

646
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,996
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

647
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,872
I don't know.

648
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,952
But I do know this -

649
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:55,947
ifthe Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

650
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,197
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

651
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:02,837
we won't be able to stop them.

652
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:05,189
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

653
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,392
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armour.

654
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,830
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

655
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:14,837
you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

656
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,838
(Chuckles softly) Is my father wrong?

657
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,947
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

658
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,516
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back

659
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,869
We hole up in our castles.

660
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,638
Awisemove-

661
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,275
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open ﬁeld.

662
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,069
They leave us in our castles.

663
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,509
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

664
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:45,234
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall,

665
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:47,754
stealing all our crops and livestock.

666
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,633
enslaving all our women and children.

667
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,069
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

668
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,316
their absentee king,
their cowardly king

669
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:58,748
hiding behind high walls?

670
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,553
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

671
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,954
is the rightful monarch after all?

672
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,589
We still outnumber them.

673
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:12,070
Which is the bigger number -
ﬁve or one?

674
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,475
Five.

675
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,237
Five...

676
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:20,995
One.

677
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,190
One army - a real army

678
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,995
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

679
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,558
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

680
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,717
Now we've got as many armies

681
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,556
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

682
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,556
And everybody wants
something different.

683
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,796
Your father wants to own the world.

684
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:46,036
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

685
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:48,070
What do you want?

686
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,149
We haven't had
a real ﬁght in nine years.

687
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,316
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a ﬁght.

688
00:43:03,399 --> 00:43:05,355
And that's all the realm is now -

689
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,470
backstabbing and scheming

690
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,478
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

691
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:14,112
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

692
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,072
- Our marriage.
- (Laughs)

693
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,389
Ah, so here we sit,

694
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,035
17 years later,
holding it all together.

695
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,470
Don't you get tired?

696
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,951
Every day.

697
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:42,997
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

698
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,908
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

699
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,478
Yes, it is.

700
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,711
Yes, it is.

701
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:59,354
What was she like?

702
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,389
You've never asked
about her, not once.

703
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,919
Why not?

704
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,389
At ﬁrst, just saying her name
even in private

705
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,557
felt like I was breathing life
back into her.

706
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:17,232
I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

707
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,079
When I realised
that wasn't going to happen,

708
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,151
I refused to ask out ofspite.

709
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,555
I didn't want to give you the satishction
of thinking I cared enough to ask

710
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,831
And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

711
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,717
As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.

712
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:41,551
What harm could Lyanna Starks ghost
do to either of us

713
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,671
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

714
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,315
You want to know the horrible truth?

715
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,351
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

716
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:03,270
I only know she was
the one thing I ever wanted.

717
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:07,594
Someone took her away from me,

718
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,793
and seven kingdoms
couldn't ﬁll the hole she left behind.

719
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,949
I felt something
for you once, you know

720
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,911
I know.

721
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,710
Even after we lost our ﬁrst boy.

722
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:28,397
For quite a while, actually.

723
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:36,797
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

724
00:45:43,919 --> 00:45:44,874
No.

725
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,077
Does that make you feel better or worse?

726
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:58,594
It doesn't make me feel anything.

727
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,233
(Door opens, closes)

728
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,391
She looks like him,

729
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,351
don't she, my lord?

730
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:19,277
She has his nose,
his black hair.

731
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,719
Aye.

732
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,717
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

733
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,913
If it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

734
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,995
- I will.
- And tell him I've been with no one else.

735
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,396
I swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

736
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,510
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

737
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:40,271
just him.

738
00:46:40,399 --> 00:46:41,912
The king was always good to me.

739
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:44,075
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

740
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,150
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

741
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,959
He just wanted to know
ifthe child was happy,

742
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,990
healthy.

743
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:57,630
Looks healthy enough to me.

744
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:01,509
The girl shall want for nothing.

745
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,669
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

746
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,358
I've found.

747
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:13,674
Whores rarely sink

748
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,507
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

749
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,949
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

750
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,511
- (Ned) How many?
- Does it matter?

751
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:29,358
If you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

752
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,311
And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

753
00:47:31,439 --> 00:47:34,192
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

754
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,356
He was overcome with fatherly love.

755
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,679
Come.

756
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:49,710
- Joryl
- My lord.

757
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,911
Such a small pack of wolves.

758
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:13,669
Stay back. ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

759
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,631
Was the Hand of the King.

760
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,509
Now I'm not sure what he is -
lord of somewhere very far away.

761
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:21,711
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

762
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,879
Get back inside where it's safe.
I'm looking for my brother.

763
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:27,637
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

764
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,673
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

765
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:35,789
- I remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

766
00:48:35,919 --> 00:48:38,592
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

767
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,872
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

768
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,394
- (Littleﬁnger) My Iordsl
- (Horse neighs)

769
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:47,908
I'll bring the City Watch.

770
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,116
Come, Stark.
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

771
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:55,110
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

772
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,033
As in, "I'm going to open your lord

773
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,589
"from balls to brains
and see what Starks are made of'?

774
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,428
You kill me,

775
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,914
your brother's a dead man.

776
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,712
You're right.

777
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:11,399
Take him alive. Kill his men.

778
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,078
(Roars)

779
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:18,797
Yahl

780
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:46,115
My brother, Lord Stark -
we want him back

781
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:55,633
(Horse neighs)
