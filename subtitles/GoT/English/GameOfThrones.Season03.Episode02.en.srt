He knew how to dress
and smile and somehow

230
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,275
this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.

231

Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.

from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him.

356
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,230
I didn't want to see those brown

357
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,350

358
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,994
So I prayed to the Gods,
take him away. Make him die.

359
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,587
He got the pox.

360
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:14,918
And I knew I was
the worst woman who ever lived.

361
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,636
A murderer.

362
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,073
l'd condemned this poor,
innocent child to a horrible death

363
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,229
all because I was jealous of his mother.

364
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,668
A woman he didn't even know.

365
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,793
So I prayed to all seven Gods,

366
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:37,113
let the boy live.

367
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,637
Let him live and I'll love him.

368
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:44,517
I'll be a motherto him.

369
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,274
l'll beg my husband to give him atrue name,

370
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,793

371
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,519
to make him one of us.

372
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,954
And he lived.

373
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,631
And he lived.

374
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,470
And I couldn't keep my promise.

375
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,639
And everything that's happened since then,

376
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,351
all this horror that's come to my family,

377
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,235
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

378
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,714

379

380

-No.
-You sure?

You have to be absolutely certain.

551
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:17,269
All right. What is this problem?

552
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:21,075
I'm worried about Sansa.

553

When she spoke with Lord Baelish,

554
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,394

Yes, well, we shouldn't
be judgemental about these things.

563

Oh, please.

565
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,152
All right, yes, I fucked her once.

567
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,439

my lady, I've been with no one else.

572
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,158
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

573
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,152
Is there
an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?

574
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,077
We have to protect her.

575
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,308
We can't.

576
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,430
Now that the Lannisters have discarded
her, Sansa will have many suitors.

00:44:54,439 --> 00:44:55,633
Only when I'm asleep.

709
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:58,187
That's how it begins
until you learn to control it.

710
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,473
You're awarg.

711
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:03,514
lt's notjust wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there's a...

712
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,874
A three-eyed raven?

713
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:06,318
You've seen it?

714
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,515
We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?

715
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,150
Does it have anything to do with warging?

716
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,915
No, the raven is
something different, something deeper.

717
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:17,514
The raven brings the sight.

718
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:20,554
Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

719
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:22,675
Orthings that happened
long before you were born

720
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,991
orthings that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

721
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:28,591
What's he telling him?

722
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:30,670
Why don't you ask?

723
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,276
lsn't he ashamed,
your brother, needing you to protect him?

724
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,231
Where's the shame in that?

725
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,876
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

726
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,157
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

727
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:48,994
Some people will always need help.

728
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:52,149
That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.

729
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,757
When my father died, I dreamt it.

730
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,596
You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.

731
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,794
You have the sight, too?

732
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,993
When I told my father about your father,

733
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,031
forthe first time in my life, I saw him cry.

734
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,838
Your father is Howland Reed?

735
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,473
Yeah.

736
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,517
He saved my father's life during the rebellion.

737
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,194
Your father told you about the rebellion?

738
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,959
Mine never did. But I sawthat, too.

739
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,194
What else have you seen?

740
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:34,238
Only one thing that matters,

741
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,439
you.

742
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,109
THOROS: I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.

743
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,438
Not that I'm averse to
drinking from a puddle every now and again.

744
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,111
I don't drink ale.

745
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,032
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

746
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,678
-Yeah!
-You see?

747
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,916
They've suffered through my bouts of

748
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,996
sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned.

749
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,593
Now, how did three children...

750
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,317
We're not children.

751
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,474
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

752
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,519
untrained in the art of war,
escape from Harrenhal?

753
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,556
Gendry's a smith.
He was apprenticed in the armoury.

754
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,988
A smith, eh? Where'd you train?

755
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,950
King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.

756
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,917
That criminal. He charges twice as much

757
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,951
as every other armourer in the city.

758
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,871
-That's because he's twice as good.
-Ah-ha!

759
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,159
A smith and a salesman.

760
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,593
-Gendry stole us weapons.
-Ah!

761
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:42,795
Fought your way out of Harrenhal, | see.

762
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:45,669
He knows how to use a sword and so do |.

763
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,353
(ALL LAUGHING)

764
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:49,388
My brothers taught me.

766
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,352

(ALL CHEERING)

768
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:11,078
To your brothers!

(ALL CHEERING)

770
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,112
You can finish your meals before you go.

771
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,032
It may be awhile before you see another.

772
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,193
You'll free us?

773
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,718
I gave you my word.

774
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:31,037
But before you go,

775
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:34,073
allow me to raise a cup to your...

776
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:35,956
-Hey, hey.
-(LAUGH|NG)

777
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,314
Nowthat is an uncommonly large person.

778
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:42,630
How does one manage to subdue
such an uncommonly large person?

779
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,153
One waits for him to drink until he passes out.

780
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,708
Poor man. You have my sympathy.

781
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,919
Aha!

782
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,192
Notaman at all.

783
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,990
-A Hound!
-(ALL HOWLING)

784
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,274
So good to see you again, Clegane.

785
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,237
Thoros?

786
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,068
The fuck you doing here?

787
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:05,512
Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.

788
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:06,992
(ALL CHUCKLING)

789
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:08,957
THOROS: A pretty prize, lads.

790
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,712
ALL: Yeah!

791
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,712
Girl.

792
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,194
What in seven hells
are you doing with the Stark bitch?

793
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,874
Take the bridge
and risk being seen or cross the great water.

794
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:38,074
BRIENNE: Silence.

795
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,355
Anyone can see us on the bridge,

796
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,473
but cross by water
and the current could take us.

797
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,231
Or I could escape down the river.

798
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,038
Good luck.

799
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,029
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

800
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,236
Which will she choose?

801
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:02,071
Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.

802
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,071
Be quick about it.

803
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,118
-Oh, I need to rest.
-Get up.

804
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,634
l have these,
on your feet when you walk too far.

805
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,073
-What do you call them?
-Get up now.

806
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:18,309
Corns. I never used to get corns.

807
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,829
| used to ride everywhere,
not march around like a common foot soldier

808
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,150
wearing the same shit boots for over a year.

809
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,628
This heel is ruined. There's no way...

(CHUCKLES)

812
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:36,957
I never understood why some knights

813
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,717
felt the need to carry two swords.

814
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,119
(EXHALES)

815
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,995
Ooh!

816
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,391
You move well

817
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,351
for a great beast of a woman.

818

(GRUNTING)

819
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:13,108
You shouldn't grimace before you
lunge. It gives away the game.

820
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:30,832
Bit ofa quandary foryou.
lfyou kill me, you fail Lady Stark.

821
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,036
But ifyou don't kill me,

822
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,074
I'm going to killyou.

823
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,476
You're good. Graceless, but good.

824
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,234
See? lfyou were willing to hurt
me, you might have had me there.

getting the better of you,

00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:44,836
if you can call that a woman.

830
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:48,958
We enjoy a good fight.
Gets ourjuices flowing.

831
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:53,551
The Flayed Man
of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.

832
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,835
You sure he's the one?

833
00:52:55,919 --> 00:52:57,477
That's him, all right.

834
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:00,471
I saw him fight at
the tourney for SerWillem Frey's wedding.

835
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:04,555
Give the man his silver.

836
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,548
Let us go and
my father will pay you whatever you want.

837
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,718
Enough to buy me a new head?

838
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,478
lfthe King in the North
hears I let the Kingslayer go,

839
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,074
he'll be taking it right off.

840
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:18,717
I'd rather he takes yours.
