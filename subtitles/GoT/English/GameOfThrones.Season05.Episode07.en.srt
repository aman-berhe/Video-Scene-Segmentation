Yes.

398

535
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:03,037
Desires that didn't even exist

536
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,433
until we invented them.

537
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,798
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

538
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,679
The past is the past.

539
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,231
The future is all that's worth discussing.

540
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,238
The future of House Tyrell.

541
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:21,833
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

542
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:23,557
my grandchildren, or me.

543
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,997
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

544
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,469
as soon as things started to go wrong.

545
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,676
-I promise you...
-I promise you, Lord Baelish,

546
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,513
that our fates are joined.

547
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,313
Together we murdered a king.

548
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,712
If my house should fall,
lwill have nothing to hide.

549
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,757
And if! should meet with some accident here
at your broken little flesh market,

550
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,068
they'll never even find what's left of you.

551
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,554
So...

552
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,797
Do you deny a part in all this?

553
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:55,907
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

554
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,635
l dared not refuse her.

555
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,477
And what did she want?

556
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,068
A piece of information she knew that I had.

557
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,437
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

558
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,752
But I have other information

559
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,958
of which she is unaware.

560
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:14,118
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

561
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,508
l have a gift for you.

562
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,394
What kind ofgift?

563
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,311

YEZZAN: Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

566
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,873
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

567
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:48,757
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

568
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:51,878
But ifyou do happen to triumph here,

569
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:56,032
you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself,
in front ofthe queen.

570
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,829
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:20,355
Let me go immediately.

715
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,031
You will order her to let me go.

716
00:54:23,479 --> 00:54:25,868
lam the queen!

717
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:27,551
Have you lost your mind?

718
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,955
Let me go!

719
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:34,229
...your filthy hands off me!
Are you out of your mind?

720
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:37,513
lam the queen! Let me go!

721
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,114
Look at me.

722
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:49,152
Look at my face.

723
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,560
It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
