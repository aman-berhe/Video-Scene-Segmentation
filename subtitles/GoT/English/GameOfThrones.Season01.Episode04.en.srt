1
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,150
(Bird sawing)

2
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,711
(Nan) The little lord's
been dreaming again.

3
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,430
(Growiing)

4
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,352
- We have visitors.
- I don‘t want to see anyone.

5
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,914
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

6
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,917
with no one but this old hat
for company, I'd go mad.

7
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,354
Anyway, you don‘t have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

8
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,278
- I don‘t want to go.
- Neither do I.

9
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,117
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,

10
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,117
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

11
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:07,150
Hodorl

12
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,472
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

13
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,511
Hodor.

14
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,676
(T ylion) I must say | meived
a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

15
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,267
(Robb) Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

16
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,867
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

17
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,149
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

18
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,271
l'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

19
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,517
- Then you might learn a lord's oourtesy.
- (Door opens)

20
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,314
So it's true.

21
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,309
Hello, Bran.

22
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,594
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

23
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,028
He has no memory of that day.

24
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,593
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

25
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:56,591
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

26
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,029
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

27
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,189
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

28
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,310
Well, I mean I did like to.

29
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,794
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

30
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,911
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

31
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,837
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

32
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,837
My father will rejoice to hear it.

33
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,110
l have a gift for you.

34
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,037
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

35
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,233
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

36
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,512
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

37
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,471
- Will I really be able to ride?
- You will.

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,636
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

39
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,910
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

40
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,351
l have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

41
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,435
You've done my brother a kindness.

42
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,436
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

43
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,429
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,279
There I'll ﬁnd a bed
and both of us can sleep easier.

45
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,708
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

46
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,228
If you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,158
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

48
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,475
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

49
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,512
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

50
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,671
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she meive me?

51
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,438
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

52
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,237
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

53
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,749
M'lady? (Chuckles)

54
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,553
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.

55
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,512
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

56
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,393
if he could see his only surviving son
has turned lackey?

57
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,228
I still remember seeing
my father's ﬂeet burn in Lannisport.

58
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:43,874
- I believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

59
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,037
Nothing prettier
than watching sailors burn alive.

60
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,472
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

61
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,717
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

62
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,038
I suppose your father realised that
when your brothers died in battle.

63
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,311
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

64
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,192
- Careful, lmp.
- I've offended you.

65
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,388
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

66
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,274
Anyway, don't despair.

67
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,469
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

68
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,750
and I've learned to live with it.

69
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,552
- (Coin clinks)
- Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

70
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,595
I'll try not to wear her out.

71
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,709
(Sighs)

72
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,554
(Jon) Shoulder, legs.

73
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:35,189
Leg, shoulder, leg.

74
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,076
Left foot forward. Good.

75
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,033
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

76
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,434
What in seven hells is that?

77
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,869
- (Pyp) They'll need an eighth hell to ﬁt him in.
- (Laughter)

78
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:50,830
Tell them your name.

79
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,837
Sanrwell Tarly,

80
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,673
of Horn Hill...
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

81
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,313
I've come to take the black

82
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,953
- Come to take the black pudding.
- (Laughter)

83
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,832
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look

84
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,791
Rast...

85
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,830
see what he can do.

86
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,990
(YEIPS)

87
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,190
(Whimpers) I yield.

88
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,754
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

89
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,909
Pick up your sword.

90
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,553
Hit him till he ﬁnds his feet.

91
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,315
(Sanrwell yelping)

92
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,477
(Whimpering)

93
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,113
It seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,834
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jonl

95
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,149
- Again, harder.
- (Growns)

96
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,589
- (Shrieks) l yieldl
- Enoughl

97
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,512
- (Sanrwell sobbing)
- He yielded.

98
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,995
Looks like the bastard's in love.

99
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,629
All right then, Lord Snow,

100
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,796
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an narcise.

101
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,752
You two. Three of you
ought to be sufﬁcient

102
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,995
to make lady piggy squeal.

103
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,953
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

104
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,792
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

105
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:27,392
Yield, yield, yieldl
I yield.

106
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,755
We're done for today.
Go clean the arrnoury.

107
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,439
That's all you're good for.

108
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,748
- Well foughtl
- Piss off.

109
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,874
(Spills)

110
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,229
- Did he hurt you?
- I've had worse.

111
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,153
You can call me Sam...
if you want.

112
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,112
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you knovn

113
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:59,675
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and ﬁght?

114
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,915
lwanted to.

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,679
- I just couldn't.
- Why not?

116
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:09,230
I'm a coward.

117
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,233
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

118
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,231
You're ﬁght. I'm sorry.

119
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:18,988
I just...wanted to thank you.

120
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:30,434
A bloody coward.

121
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,473
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,318
You're too stupid to be a coward.

123
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,231
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

124
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:41,112
before summer's over. (Laughing)

125
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,155
Come herel

126
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,155
(Horse neighs)

127
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,590
- (Neighs)
- Hyah, hyahl

128
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,630
(Jorah) Vaes Dotth -
the city of the horselords.

129
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:25,028
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

130
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,516
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

131
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,835
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- I'll call them what I like,

132
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,554
because they're my people.
This is my army.

133
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,513
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

134
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:59,397
If my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

135
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,908
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

136
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,713
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

137
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,915
They fear any water
their horses can't drink

138
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,553
But if they did?

139
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,877
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

140
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,468
but the men
advising him are different.

141
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,752
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

142
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,710
long ago.

143
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,070
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

144
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,350
He drove me from my land.

145
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,915
You sold slaves.

146
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,598
Aye.

147
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:38,271
- Why?
- I had no money

148
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,395
and an expensive wife.

149
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,237
And where is she novn

150
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:44,469
In another place,

151
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,716
with another man.

152
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,796
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

153
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,356
They call you the last dragon...

154
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,948
They do.

155
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:05,112
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

156
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,150
It's entirely possible.

157
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,589
(Chuckles)
What happened to the dragons?

158
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,632
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

159
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,395
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

160
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,828
The brave men rode them.

161
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,190
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

162
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,674
this world has ever seen.

163
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,951
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

164
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,833
which the Usurper is
keeping warm for me.

165
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,752
The swords of the vanquished,

166
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,915
a thousand of them...

167
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,192
melted together
like so many candles.

168
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,996
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

169
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,475
There's nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

170
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,034
Really. Why dragons?

171
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,512
They can ﬂy.

172
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,472
And wherever they are,
just a few ﬁaps of their wings

173
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,955
and they're somewhere else...

174
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,036
far away.

175
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,710
And they can kill.

176
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,709
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

177
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,276
- gets burned away to nothing...
- (Gasm)

178
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:24,031
..melted...

179
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,839
like so many candles.

180
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,473
ON.

181
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,199
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

182
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:36,230
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

183
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,827
I imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

184
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,633
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

185
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,398
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

186
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,234
a man from Asshai
with a dagger of real dragonglass.

187
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,150
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

188
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:53,755
change his face the way
that other men change their clothes.

189
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,315
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

190
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,718
and whose ship had
sails of coloured silk

191
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,871


192
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,309
have you seen one?

193
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,351
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

194
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,230
No.

195
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:17,715
No, the last one died
many years before I was born.

196
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,756
I'll tell you what I have seen -

197
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,909
their skulls.

198
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,872
They used to dmorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

199
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,353
When I was very young,
just three or four,

200
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,869
my father used
to walk me down the rows

201
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:33,149
and I'd recite
their names for him.

202
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,794
When I got them all ﬁght,
he'd give me a sweet.

203
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,673
The ones closest to the door
were the last ones they were able to hatch

204
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:44,156
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

205
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,552
But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

206
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,798
and bigger and bigger.

207
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,868
There was Ghisoar

208
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,354
and Valryon,

209
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,152
Vermithrax.

210
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,355
Essovius. . . (Gasps)

211
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,789
..Archonei,

212
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,077


213
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:15,996
Vhagar...

214
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:20,557
- and Balerion the Dread...
- (Moans)

215
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,508
..whose ﬁre forged
the Seven Kingdoms

216
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,596
into one.

217
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,159
What happened to the skulls?

218
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,598
I don't know.

219
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,837
The Usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

220
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,671
Scattered to the wind.

221
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,308
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

222
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,551
What did I buy you for?

223
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:57,716
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

224
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,912
To, uh, teach your sister.

225
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,917
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

226
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,077
You think I bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

227
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,199
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

228
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,031
(Chuckles)

229
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,196
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

230
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,633
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

231
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,990
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

232
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:43,556
All the lords of Westeros
will gather here to see the little prince.

233
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,670
- What if I have a girl?
- Gods be good,

234
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,597
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

235
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,710
What if I only have girls?

236
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,637
I wouldn't worry about that.

237
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,797
Jeyne Poole's mother
had ﬁve children - all of them girls.

238
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,756
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

239
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,109
But what if?

240
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:03,390
Well, if you only had girls,

241
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,916
I suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

242
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,549
And everyone would hate me.

243
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,679
Nobody could ever hate you.

244
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,439
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

245
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,789
Why would you say such a thing?

246
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,551
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

247
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,516
I've told you
a hundred times -

248
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,433
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

249
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,510
Do you remember your lessons?

250
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:35,038
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

251
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,556
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

252
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,398
And how many years
did it take to build...

253
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,671
My grandfather and uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

254
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,911
They were killed
on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

255
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,079
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

256
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,791
Why were they killed?

257
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:58,278
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

258
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,395
I don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

259
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,512
Sansa, you will
ﬁnd it in your heart

260
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:07,109
- to forgive your father.
- No, I won't.

261
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,480
(Man) It's the Hand's Tournament
that's causing all this trouble, my lords.

262
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,593
The King's Tournament.
I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

263
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,630
Call it what you will, Lord Stark. ser,

264
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,751
the city is packed with people
and more ﬂooding in every day.

265
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,595
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel ﬁre,

266
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:26,552
three stabbings and a drunken horse race
down the Street of Sisters.

267
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,240
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

268
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,237
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

269
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,917
- I need more men.
- (Ned) You'll get 50.

270
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,759
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

271
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,190
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can ﬁnd money to keep the peace.

272
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,032
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

273
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,391
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

274
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,159
They will be put to good use.

275
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,157
The sooner this is over, the better.

276
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,918
The realm prospers
from such events, my lord.

277
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,718
(Littleﬁnger) And every inn
in the city is full

278
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,636
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

279
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,034
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

280
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,515
- Hmm.
- Now...

281
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:11,948
ifthere's nothing else, my lords?

282
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,275
Oh, this heat.

283
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,073
On days like this,
I envy you northemers,

284
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,873
your summer snows.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

285
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,559
I've been hoping
to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

286
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,237
Lord Arryn?

287
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:38,711
Oh, his death was
a great sadness to all of us.

288
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,674
I took personal charge of his care,
but I could not save him.

289
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,272
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

290
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,715
I saw him in my chambers
just the night before he passed.

291
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,469
- Lord Jon often come to me for counsel.
- Why?

292
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,073
I have been grand maester
for many years.

293
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,152
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since...

294
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,038
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

295
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,429
Oh, he came inquiring after a book

296
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,677
A book’? What book’?

297
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,957
Oh, I fear it would be
of little interest to you, my lord.

298
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,468
A... A ponderous tome.

299
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,915
No, I'd like to read it.

300
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,078
The Lineages and Histories

301
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:33,231
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

302
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,238
with descriptions
of many high lords

303
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,237
and noble ladies

304
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:41,315
and their children.

305
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,190
Harkon Umber,
ﬁrst of his name,

306
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,790
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

307
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,347
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

308
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:09,551
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

309
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,911
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

310
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,109
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

311
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,754
As I said, my lord,
a ponderous read.

312
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,347
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

313
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,198
He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask

314
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,390
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

315
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,828
..did he say anything to you
during his ﬁnal hours?

316
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,751
Nothing of import, my lord.

317
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,310
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

318
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,591
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

319
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,835
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mmm.

320
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,109
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

321
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,715
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

322
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,795
For all the weight they're given,

323
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,469
last words are usually
as signiﬁcant as ﬁrst words.

324
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,477
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

325
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,510
What else could it be?

326
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:02,472
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

327
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,754
No, no, no, I don't think it likely.

328
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,158
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

329
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,839
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

330
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:16,111
Yes, women, cravens...

331
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:17,877
and eunuchs.

332
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,956
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

333
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,072
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

334
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,794
How that sort of person
found himself

335
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,754
- on the king's council, I will never know.
- I've taken enough of your time.

336
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,678
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honour.

337
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,279
Thank you.

338
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,311
I'll ﬁnd my own way out.

339
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,959
(FOOMGPS)

340
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,071
Syrio says a water dancer
can stand on one toe for hours.

341
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,997
It's a hard fall down these steps.

342
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,197
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

343
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:16,717
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

344
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,069
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

345
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,033
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

346
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,038
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's ﬁght about that.

347
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,079
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

348
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,309
Well, he needs to get
his strength back ﬁrst.

349
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,431
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

350
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,552
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

351
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,472
But someday
he could be lord of a holdfast

352
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,397
or sit on the king's council.

353
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,070
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

354
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,278
-Can I belordofaholdfast?
- (Chuckles)

355
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,036
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

356
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,028
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

357
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,953
- Hmm?
- No.

358
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,870
That's not me.

359
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,869
(Wind whistling)

360
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,470
Hello.

361
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,399
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new watch partner.

362
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,509
I should warn you,

363
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:51,914
I don't see all that well.

364
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,799
Come stand by the ﬁre.

365
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,915
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all ﬁght. I'm ﬁne.

366
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,599
You're not. You're freezing.

367
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,794
I don't like high places.

368
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:18,588
You can't ﬁght. You can't see.

369
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,950
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

370
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,879
What are you doing here, Sam?

371
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,795
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

372
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,116
"You're almost a man now," he said.

373
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:41,278
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

374
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:43,788
"Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black.

375
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,151
"forsake all claim
to your inheﬁtance and start north.

376
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,355
"If you do not," he said,

377
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,668
"then we'll have a hunt

378
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,758
"and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

379
00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:00,552
"and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

380
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,595
"Or so I'll tell your mother.

381
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,991
"Nothing would please me more."

382
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,352
Ser Alliser's going to make me
ﬁght again tomorrow, isn't he?

383
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,271
- Yes, he is.
- (Groans)

384
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,792
I'm not going to get
any better, you know.

385
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,032
Well...

386
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,758
you can't get any worse.

387
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,434
(Both chuckling)

388
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,159
I hear you're reading a boﬁng book

389
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,918
Hmph.

390
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,555
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

391
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,910
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

392
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,393
Not surpﬁsing.

393
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,876
Until mently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

394
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:56,998
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

395
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,030
Knighted for what?

396
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:03,476
- Why are you telling me this?
- I promised Cat that I'd help you.

397
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,710
Where is Ser Hugh?

398
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,399
- I'll speak to him.
- A singulaﬁy bad idea.

399
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,874
Do you see that boy there?

400
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:13,433
(Whispers) One of Varys's little birds.

401
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,996
The spider has taken a great interest
in your comings and goings.

402
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,910
Now look there.

403
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,793
That one belongs to the queen.

404
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:25,918
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

405
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,953
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

406
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,547
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

407
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,997
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

408
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:45,117
Get a message to
this paragon of yours - discreetly.

409
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,673
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

410
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,633
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain arrnourer in the city.

411
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,472
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

412
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,869
- Why?
- I have my obseNers, as I said,

413
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:59,229
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

414
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,233
visit this arrnourer several times
in the weeks before his death.

415
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,512
Lord Baelish, perhaps
I was wrong to distrust you.

416
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:11,837
Distrusting me was the wisest thing
you've done since you climbed off your horse.

417
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,112
- (Hammeﬁng)
- ..22, 23,

418
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,874
24, 5, 6, 27,

419
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,637
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

420
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,670
30, 31, 32..

421
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,916
- Ser Hughl
- As you can see, I'm busy.

422
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,954
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Staﬁt.
the Hand of the King.

423
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,435
- I'm the ptacain of his guard.
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...

424
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,557
- No "ser". I'm not a knight.
- I see.

425
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,199
Well, it just so happens that I am.

426
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:49,751
(Continues counting)

427
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:52,951
(Jory) He said he'd be glad
to talk to the Hand himself.

428
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,111
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

429
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,550
They strut around
like roosters down here.

430
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,432
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

431
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,198
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

432
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,552
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look

433
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,636
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

434
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,593
I regret to say he did not honour me
with his patronage.

435
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:19,951
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

436
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,038
- I'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

437
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,956
Gendryl

438
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,839
Here he is.

439
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,792
Strong for his age.
He woﬁ<s hard.

440
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,630
Show the Hand
the helmet you made, lad.

441
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,514
- This is ﬁne woﬁc
- It's not for sale.

442
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,476
Boy, this is the King's Handl

443
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:57,836
- If his lordship wants the helmet...
- I made it for me.

444
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:01,474
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

445
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,955
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

446
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:06,876
He just asked me
questions is all, my lord.

447
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,911
What kind of questions?

448
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,832
About my woﬁ< at ﬁrst,

449
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:16,871
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

450
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:21,632
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

451
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,070
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

452
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,430
What did you tell him?

453
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:31,439
She died when I was little.

454
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,312
She had yellow hair.

455
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,433
She'd sing to me sometimes.

456
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,237
Look at me.

457
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,432
Get back to work. lad.

458
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,308
If the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

459
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,669
you send him to me.

460
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,552
(Hammer banging)

461
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,910
Find anything?

462
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,035
King Robert's bastard son.

463
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:13,148
(Robert laughing)

464
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,509
- (Woman) He likes that.
- (Women laughing)

465
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:19,797
This is for the king from Lord Staﬁc

466
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,876
- (Robert laughs)
- Should I leave it with...

467
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:25,435
- Shhh. Listen.
- (Women laughing)

468
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,994
Do you hear them?

469
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,594
How many do you think
are in there with him? Huh?

470
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:36,037
- Guess.
- Three.

471
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,116
- (Laughter)
- Four.

472
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:42,268
He likes to do this when I'm on duty.

473
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,355
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

474
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,796
- (Door opens)
- (Laughter)

475
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,955
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do I have to forgive you?

476
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,393
Have you wronged me?

477
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,432
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

478
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,036
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

479
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,798
Ah.

480
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,751
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

481
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,917
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys neaﬁy took my eye.

482
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:12,712
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

483
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,034
They stopped liking it at the end.

484
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,189
That was a proper battle.

485
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,392
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

486
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,353
With his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.

487
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,512
I saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

488
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,159
It was like seeing a shaﬁ<
on a mountaintop.

489
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,471
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- I doubt it.

490
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,954
- (Laughter)
- (Door opens)

491
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,594
(Robert) I'll bet you smell
of blackberry jaml

492
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:44,438
Let me smell it. Come here.

493
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,798
Can I leave this with you?
The message from Lord Staﬁc

494
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,995
I don't serve Lord Staﬁc

495
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,990
(Laughter continues)

496
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:15,594
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

497
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,869
- With Sam.
- Ah, Pﬁnce Poﬁtchop.

498
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,752
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

499
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,552
- Impossiblel
- (Chuckles)

500
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,635
That's enough.

501
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,393
Sam's no different from the rest of us.

502
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,876
There was no place for him in the woﬁd,
so he's come here.

503
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:38,314
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

504
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,034
Never again,
no matter what Thome says.

505
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,515
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

506
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,989
- (Rast) You are in love, Lord Snow.
- (Laughter)

507
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,193
You giﬁs can do as you please.

508
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,919
But if Thome puts me
up against Lady Piggy,

509
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,990
I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

510
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,195
(Laughter)

511
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:03,794
(Snoﬁng)

512
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,672
(Panting)

513
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,030
(Growling)

514
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,753
No one touches Sam.

515
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:36,549
What are you waiting for?

516
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,068
Attack himl

517
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,075
You get in there.

518
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,271
Hit me.

519
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,436
Go on, hit mel

520
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,437
(Shouts)

521
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,835
- I yieldl
- (Laughter)

522
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,757
Yield. Yield.

523
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,871
I yield.

524
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,990
You think this is funny, do you?

525
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,076
When you're out there
beyond the Wall with the sun going down,

526
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,831
do you want a man at your back?

527
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,189
Or a snivelling boy?

528
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,710
(Sobbing)

529
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,553
You send this whore
to give me commands?

530
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,194
I should have sent you back her headl

531
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,436
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

532
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,438
Hush now. It's all ﬁght.
Irﬁ, take her and leave us.

533
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,629
Yes, Khaleesi.

534
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,638
- Why did you hit her?l
- How many times do I have to tell you?

535
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:09,348
- You do not command me.
- I wasn't commanding you.

536
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,993
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

537
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,156
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

538
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:15,793
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

539
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,637
- Are you going to dress me novf?
- Please.

540
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,069
This stinks of manure. All of it.

541
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,991
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

542
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:24,468
You would turn me
into one of them, wouldn't you?

543
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,114
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no ﬁght to a braid.

544
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:31,790
- You've won no victoﬁes yet.
- You do not talk back to mel

545
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,311
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

546
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,472
- (Metal jangles)
- (Screams)

547
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,236
I am a khaleesi of the Dothrakil

548
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,155
I am the wife of the great khal
and I car'ry his son inside me.

549
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,875
The next time you raise a hand to me

550
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:57,917
will be the last time you have hands.

551
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,787
(Thunder rumbles, rain falling)

552
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:08,636
I know for a fact that some of the ofﬁcers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

553
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,034
I wouldn't doubt it.

554
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,235
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

555
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,229
Making us take our vows while they sneak off
for a little Sally on the side?

556
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,635
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

557
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:23,950
What, we can't defend
the Wall unless we're celibate?

558
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,514
- It's absurd.
- I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

559
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,192
Why not?

560
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,032
Because I'm fat?

561
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,396
- No.
- But I like giﬁs just as much as you do.

562
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,994
They might not like me as much.

563
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:44,957
I've never...been with one.

564
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,714
You've probably had hundreds.

565
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,755
No.

566
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,631
As a matter of fact,

567
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,198
I'm the same as you.

568
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,270
Yeah. Yeah, I...

569
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,991
| ﬁnd that hard to believe.

570
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,514
I came very close once.

571
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,597
I was alone in a room
with a naked giﬁ, but...

572
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,831
- Didn't know where to put it?
- I knowwhereto put it.

573
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,713
Was she...

574
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,831
old and ugly?

575
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:16,471
Young and gorgeous.

576
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,791
A whore named Ros.

577
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,750
What colour hair?

578
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,440
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

579
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,311
And her, um...

580
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:31,077
Her...

581
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,596
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

582
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,279
So why unctly did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect...?

583
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,510
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

584
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,470
And why is my surname Snovf?

585
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,350
Because...

586
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:55,754
you're a bastard from the North.

587
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,954
I never met my mother.

588
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,633
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

589
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,796
I don't know if she's living or dead.

590
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,998
I don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a ﬁsherrnan's wife...

591
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,751
or a whore.

592
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,074
So I satthere

593
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,236
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

594
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:25,754
But I couldn't do it.

595
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,991
Because all I could think was
what if I got her pregnant

596
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,910
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snovf?

597
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,039
It's not a good life for a child.

598
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,150
Ah, mmm.

599
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,239


600
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,916
you didn't know where to put it?

601
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,150
(Laughing)

602
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,431
Enjoying yourselves?

603
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,230
You look cold, boys.

604
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,113
- (Door creaks)
- It is a bit nippy.

605
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,912
A bit nippy. yeah, by the ﬁre,

606
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,911
indoors.

607
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,631
It's still summer.

608
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:16,357
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

609
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:20,151
How long has it been novf?
What, 10 years?

610
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,671
I remember.

611
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:25,114
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

612
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:27,116
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

613
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,397
never mind how many ﬁres
your servants built?

614
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,273
- I build my own ﬁres.
- That's admirable.

615
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:37,232
I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

616
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,999
duﬁng the last winter.

617
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,829
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

618
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,037
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

619
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,832
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

620
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:52,473
ptcaure them,
gather some knowledge.

621
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,949
The wildlings who ﬁght
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

622
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,111
Harder than you'll ever be.

623
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,594
They know their country
better than we do.

624
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,074
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

625
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,476
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

626
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,914
And we got caught in the open.

627
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,758
Wind so strong

628
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,759
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground, roots and all.

629
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,474
If you took your gloves off
to ﬁnd your cock to have a piss,

630
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,512
you lost a ﬁnger to the frost.

631
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,357
And all in daﬁmess.

632
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,835
You don't know cold.

633
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,790
Neither of you do.

634
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,390
The horses died ﬁrst.

635
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:41,876
We didn't have enough
to feed them, to keep them warm.

636
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:45,994
Eating the horses was easy.

637
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,839
But later when we started to fall...

638
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,511
That wasn't easy.

639
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,310
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

640
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,752
- (Grabs)
- (Gasps)

641
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,269
Soft, fat boys like you.

642
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:11,109
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

643
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:16,478
Soon we'll have new recruits

644
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,750
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

645
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,711
for assignment,

646
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,118
and they will call you
men of the Night's Watch,

647
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,797
but you'd be fools to believe it.

648
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:31,191
You're boys still.

649
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,796
And come the winter you will die...

650
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,151
like ﬂies.

651
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,394
I hit him.

652
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,839
I hit the dragon.

653
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:50,114
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

654
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,708
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

655
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,758
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

656
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,668
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

657
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,199
No.

658
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,189
But the common people
are waiting for him.

659
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:09,397
Illyﬁo said they are sewing dragon banners
and praying for his return.

660
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,990
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

661
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,271
They don't car'e
what games the high lords play.

662
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:19,907
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

663
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,072
Home.

664
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,310
I pray for home too.

665
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,519
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

666
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:39,828
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

667
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,834
He'll never take us home.

668
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,030
(Crowd chatteﬁng and yelling)

669
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:55,633
(Horse whinnies)

670
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,030
Lovers' quarrel?

671
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,558
I'm sorry. Do I...?

672
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,954
Sansa dear,
this is Lord Baelish.

673
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,116
- He's known...
- An old ﬁiend of the family.

674
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:15,029
I've known your mother a long, long time.

675
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,236
- Why do they call you Littleﬁnger?
- Aryal

676
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:20,038
- Don't be rudel
- No, it's quite all ﬁght.

677
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,078
When I was a child, I was very small,

678
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,190
and I come from a little spit of land
called the Fingers,

679
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,279
so you see,
it's an emeedingly clever nickname.

680
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:32,959
I've been sitting here for daysl

681
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,470
Start the damn joust
before I piss myselﬂ

682
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,516
(Crowd cheeﬁng)

683
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:46,387
Gods, who's that?

684
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,794
(Littleﬁnger) Ser Gregor Clegane.

685
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,672
They call him the Mountain.

686
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:55,799
The Hound's older brother.

687
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,917
- And his opponent?
- (Littleﬁnger) Ser Hugh of the Vale.

688
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:00,791
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

689
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:02,432
Look how far he's come.

690
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,593
Yes, yes, enough of
the bloody pomp. Have at himl

691
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,230
(Horse neighs)

692
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,558
(Screams)

693
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,909
(CFOWd gasps)

694
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,030
(Gurgling)

695
00:45:57,919 --> 00:45:59,637
(Fly buzzing)

696
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,231
Not what you were expecting?

697
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,075
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

698
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,710
Lovely little tale of brotheﬁy love.

699
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,153
The Hound was just a pup,

700
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,355
six years old maybe.

701
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,390
Gregor a few years older,

702
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,109
already a big lad,
already getting a bit of a reputation.

703
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,871
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

704
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,836
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the ﬁre -

705
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:02,154
Gregor's toy,

706
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:04,793
a wooden knight.

707
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:06,716
Gregor never said a word,

708
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,673
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

709
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,951
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

710
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,556
Held him there
while the boy screamed,

711
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,716
while his face melted.

712
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,556
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

713
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:30,069
- I won't tell anyone. I promise.
- No, please don't.

714
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:33,316
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

715
00:47:33,439 --> 00:47:37,557
I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

716
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,596
(Knocking)

717
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:52,756
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

718
00:47:55,799 --> 00:47:58,313
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

719
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:01,476
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

720
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:06,195
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingst behind us -

721
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,834
the ugliness with the wolves.

722
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:12,468
And forcing you to kill the beast
was extreme.

723
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:17,069
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

724
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,957
How is Sansa?

725
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,798
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Staﬁ< who does.

726
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,672
Favours her mother,
not much of the North in her.

727
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,315
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

728
00:48:31,439 --> 00:48:33,430
What is it you hope to awomplish?

729
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:36,278
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

730
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:38,674
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

731
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,314
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

732
00:48:41,479 --> 00:48:43,947
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

733
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,719
You'll try your best
to pick up the pimes.

734
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,354
If that's my job, then so be it.

735
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,155
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

736
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,716
You take your orders
and you car'ry on.

737
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,677
I suppose it makes sense.

738
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,718
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

739
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,798
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

740
00:49:08,399 --> 00:49:10,310
Aswasl.

741
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,307
(Door opens, closes)

742
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:23,070
(Horse snorts)

743
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,076
(D09 barking)

744
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:29,391
Seven blessings to you, goodfolkl

745
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,230
And to you.

746
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,430
Boyl Bread, meat and beer. Ouickly.

747
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,835
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
I'm starving.

748
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:39,395
- A song while we wait or...?
- I'd rather throw myself down a well.

749
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:42,915
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

750
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,957
The only music the northemers know
is the howling of wolvesl

751
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,832
- (Laughs)
- (Door opens)

752
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:49,438
Gods.

753
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,039
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

754
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:53,878
- Every room.
- (T yﬁon) My men can sleep in the stable.

755
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:56,951
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

756
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:01,834
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing I can do...

757
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:04,234
- (Coin clanks)
- ..to remedy this?

758
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,477
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

759
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,634
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

760
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,590
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannisterl

761
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,153
Might I entertain you while you eat?

762
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,918
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landingl

763
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,510
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

764
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,599
Lady Staﬁ<l
What an unexpected pleasure.

765
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:29,918
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

766
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:31,757
Lady Starkl

767
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,876
I was still Catelyn Tully
the last time I stayed here.

768
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,270
You, ser.

769
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,272
Is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

770
00:50:53,399 --> 00:50:54,798
It is, my lady.

771
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,480
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest ﬁiend

772
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,434
to my father,
Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

773
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,038
She is.

774
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:08,355
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

775
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,554
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannerrnen.

776
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,114
Our lord is honoured by his trust.

777
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:19,032
I envy your father
all his ﬁne ﬁiends, Lady Staﬁt.

778
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,510
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

779
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:25,830
I know your sigil as well -

780
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:29,593
the twin towers of Frey.

781
00:51:29,759 --> 00:51:31,795
How fares your lord, ser?

782
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,192
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

783
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,756
He has asked your father for the honour
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

784
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,950
- He plans to take another wife.
- (T yﬁon) Hal

785
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,192
This man...

786
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,152
came into my house as a guest

787
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,993
and there conspired
to murder my son.

788
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,194
Aboyof10.

789
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,917
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

790
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:05,718
I call upon you to seize him

791
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,074
and help me return him to Winterfell

792
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,430
to await the king's justice.
