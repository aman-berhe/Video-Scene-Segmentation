188
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,192
I wonder if I might ask you for a favour.

189
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,792
Of course, Your Grace.

190
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,269
I believe that House Tyrell don't hold the
crown's best interests at heart.

191
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:35,830

shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?

192
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,388
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

193
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,914
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

194
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:44,036
And he appreciates
those who aid his family, as you well know.

195
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,269
He's almost as generous to those who help us

196
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,595
as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.

197
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,988
You have a good
working relationship with the Tyrells.

198
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,958

look into it before you leave the capital.

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,871
-I shall do my best.
-Thank you.

200
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,598
And your best will prove better than

201
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,392

202
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,993

203

We're not in a tavern.

204

-Pardon, my lady.
-No need to speak.

208
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,317
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.

209
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,435
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

210
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,069
I climbed all those steps
to discuss financial matters?

211
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,628
It's the royal wedding.
I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

212
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,277
Naturally.

213
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,350
lt's shaping up to be a very involved affair.

214
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,231
The word "extravagant" has been used.

215
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,997
What good is the word "extravagant"

216
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,389
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

217
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,198
-I understand that.
-Good.

218
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,191
But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me

219
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,231
to calculate the cost for the crown.

220
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,709
As of now, it's a huge expense.

221
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,868
And?

222
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,511
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

223
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,750

224
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,238
And maintaining supply lines...

225
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,792
I can't think how it slipped my mind.

226
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,998
What is it, 12,000
infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?

227
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,357
1,800 mounted lances. 2,000 in support.

228
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,317
Provisions, so this city
might survive the winter.

229
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,753
A million bushels of wheat.

230
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,275
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

231
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,476
20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep.

232
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,949
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

233
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,792
I'm quite familiar with them.

234
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,438
And we are grateful for your contributions,

235
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,988
which are necessary
for the preservation ofthe realm.

236
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,115
As is a royal wedding.

237
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,475
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

238
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,788
They crave distractions.

239
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,071
And ifwe don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

240
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,435
And their distractions are likely to

241
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,835
end with us being torn to pieces.

242
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,275

safer. Wouldn't you say?

243
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,959

impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.

356
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,596
Cersei.

358
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,597
Ser Meryn.

359
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,431
The Hound.

360
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,711
What are you going to do with me?

361
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,072
At first light we'll ride for
Riverrun. Your brother's there now.

362
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,108
He'll make a contribution to our
cause, and you can go home.

363
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,874
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

364
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,312
Don't think of it that way.

365
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,593
But it is that way.

366
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,868
It is.

367
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,189
And it isn't.

368
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,389
More is than isn't.

369
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,672
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

370
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,590
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.

371
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,158
So, why don't you?

372
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,793
We need the gold.

374
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:42,152
Do | frighten you, child?

375
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,712
No.

376
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,074
You're angry with me, and I don't blame you,

377
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,395
but letting him go was the right thing.

378
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,871
l have more reason to want him hanged.

379
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,028
I thought he killed you.

380
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,275
He did.

381
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,951
But how...

382
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,034
Thoros, how manytimes
have you brought me back?

383
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,154
It's the Lord of Light who brings you back.

384
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,873
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.

385
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,028
How manytimes?

386
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:10,274
Five, lthink.

387
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,758
No, this makes six.

388
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,554
Six.

389
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,709
There was the first time. The Mountain.

390
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:17,868
Show her.

391
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,396
Lance right through the chest.

392
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,989
BERIC: Then I was stabbed in the belly.

393
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,671
Then it was an arrow in the back.

394
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,989
And that axe in the side.

395
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,230
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

396
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:34,751
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?

397
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,831
Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

398
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:40,038
And the Hound makes six.

399
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,518
Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

400
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,351
THOROS: You'd think you'd learn.

401
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,513
It's not getting any easier, you know.

402
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,393
BERIC: I know.

403
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,430
Every time I come back,

404
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,314
I'm a bit less.

405
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,150
Pieces of you get chipped away.

406
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,797
Could you bring back a man without a head?

407
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:07,391
Not sixtimes. Just once.

408
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,111
I don't think it works that way, child.

409
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:21,632
He was a good man, Ned Stark.
He's at rest now, somewhere.

410
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,515

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,319

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,553
I know of your troubles, my King.

425
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,107
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

426
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,313
Yes, of course.

You are the One God's
champion and the finest man I've ever known.

431

Selyse.

432
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,471
I've broken a sacred vow.

433
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,635

00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,033
No.

435
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,479
l've wronged you.

436
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,908

You're doing God's work.

438
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:05,318
You don't understand.

I know, Stannis.

442
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,953
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

443
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,952
No act done in service
ofthe Lord of Light can ever be a sin.

444
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,555
When she told me,

445
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:35,507
l wept with joy.

I thank God every day
for bringing Melisandre to us.

-nothing.
-That's not true.

So, you've come to see her as well?

There is no need.

454
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,435
You must keep away from such distractions.

455
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:29,913
She's my daughter.

456
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,395

You've grown since I last saw you.

468
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,395
Did you win?

No.

470
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,916
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?

471
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,996
He did. He fought bravely.

472
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,751
He hasn't come to visit me.

473
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,760
He said he'd bring
me back a present from the capital.

He won't be visiting, child.

475

Why not? He's my friend.

00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,238
Look.

477
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,118
He made this for me.

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,757
But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret.

479

Of course.

515
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,553
The Mad King was obsessed with it.

516
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,551
He loved to watch people burn,

517
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,110
the way their skin blackened and
blistered and melted offtheir bones.

518
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,155
He burned lords he didn't like.

519
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,236
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.

520
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,278
He burned anyone who was against him.

521
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:01,072
Before long, halfthe country was against him.

522
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,315
Aerys saw traitors everywhere,

523
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,198
so he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire all over the city,

524
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,949
beneath the Sept of Baelor
and the slums of Flea Bottom.

525
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:21,156

526
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,675
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.

529
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,956
after his victory at the Trident.

530
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,954
But my father arrived first,
with the whole Lannister army at his back,

531
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,668
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

532
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,116
I knew my father better than that.

533
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,355
He's never been one to pickthe losing side.

534
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,431
I told the Mad King as much.

535
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,276
l urged him to surrender peacefully.

536
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,671
But the King didn't listen to me.

537
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,870
He didn't listen to Varys,
who tried to warn him.

538
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:07,793
But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle,

539
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,515
that grey, sunken cunt.

540
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,548
"You can trust the Lannisters," he said.

541
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,678
"The Lannisters
have always been true friends ofthe crown."

542
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:27,589
So, we opened the gates,
and my father sacked the city.

543
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,992
Once again,
I came to the King, begging him to surrender.

544
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,350
He told me to bring him my father's head.

545
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,388
Then he turned to his pyromancer.

546
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,308
"Burn them all," he said.

547
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,916
"Burn them in their homes.
Burn them in their beds."

548
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,991
Tell me, ifyour precious Renly

549
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,799

550
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,235

553
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,119
Would you have kept your oath then?

554
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:22,151
First, I killed the pyromancer.

555
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:26,433
And then, when the King turned to flee,

556
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:29,798
I drove my sword into his back.

557
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:34,227
"Burn them all,"
he kept saying. "Burn them all."

558
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,069
I don't think he expected to die.

559
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:44,119
He meant to burn with the rest of us

560
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,509
and rise again,

561

00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:06,918
The Karstarks are gone.

710
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,314
(CLATTERING)

711
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,633
Almost half our forces.

712
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,471
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to
do to make us unravel.

713
00:45:14,399 --> 00:45:15,752
Nothing.

714
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:18,151
Only wait.

715
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:19,708
Don't let him.

716
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:24,275
What can I do? Attack King's Landing?

717
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:28,075
There's nothing
he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.

718
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,554
We could ride north.

719
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,680
Take your land back
from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.

720
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,072
Winter could last five years.

721
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:37,638
Once my bannermen are home again,

722
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,195
sitting bythe fire,
surrounded bytheir families,

723
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,192
warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.

724
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,031
When I gathered my lords
together, we had a purpose, a mission.

725
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,793
Now we're like a band of bickering children.

726
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,911
Give them a new purpose.

727
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,353
What?

728
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,469
I don't know.
I don't even know where Winterfell is.

729
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:05,991
Here.

730
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,794
And we're here.

731
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,315
King's Landing...

732
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:20,427
What is it?

733
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,917
I can't force them to meet us in the field

734
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:29,115
and I can't attackthem
where they're strongest,

735
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,073
but I can attack them where they're not.

736
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,792
And Casterly Rock can't run away.

737
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,999
I'm going to take their home away from them.

738
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:42,797
Can you do it?

739
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,157
I need men to
replace the Karstarks who marched home.

740
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,477
There is only one person in this kingdom

741
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,632
with that kind of army
who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.

742
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:52,953
(LAUGHS)

743
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,510
The man whose daughter
lwas supposed to marry.

744
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,319
Walder Frey.

745
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,273
(GRUNTING)

746
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,191
He's such a splendid fighter.

747
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:12,313
Do you have any idea when we might...

748
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,835
l'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and l are married.

749
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:17,352
It should grow quickly.

750
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:21,671
Joffrey won't let me leave.
He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

751
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:24,228
And only one to let you go.

752
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,953
Because it will please me.

753
00:47:27,479 --> 00:47:29,276
LORAS: Squire.

754
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:33,953
Well fought, ser.

755
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:35,677
That was no fight.

756
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,829
I don't know you.

757
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:39,149
Olyver, if it please you.

758
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,238
lshould like to
see you spar with a proper partner, ser.

759
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,759
(MOANS)

760
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:51,749
(PANTING)

761
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:52,954
How did you know?

762
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,711
Know what?

763
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,912
That I wanted to.

764
00:47:57,999 --> 00:47:59,671
My lord...

765
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:05,193
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon,

766
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,747
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

767
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:11,118
They rarely do, in my experience.

768
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:13,667
You have a good deal of experience, do you?

769
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,113
With the husbands.

770
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,957
That didn't take long.

771
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,397
Well, it took long enough.

772
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:33,877
It seems
our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.

773
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:35,358
Is he?

774
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:36,913
And...

775
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:39,431
Who's the lucky girl?

776
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:42,717
LlTTLEFlNGER: She may
not be the grandest ship in the world

777
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,591
or the fastest,

778
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:47,068
but she's mine.

779
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,314
I've always wanted a ship.
Now I want a dozen.

780
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,955
Strange, isn't it?

781
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,195
What is?

782
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,316
It doesn't matter what we want,

783
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:02,232
once we get it, then we want something else.

784
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,107
Your hair is different.

785
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:09,552
Is it?

786
00:49:09,999 --> 00:49:11,318
Lady Margaery wears it that way.

787
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:13,310
Many ladies wear it this way.

788
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,436
l have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.

789
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:18,747
You still want me to come with you?

790
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,957
It's not
a question of what I want. It's what you want.

791
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,278
You want to go home, don't you?

792
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:26,516
Of course. More than anything.

793
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,878
But maybe it would be better to wait.

794
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,913
I've been thinking how dangerous it would
be. Notjust for me, but foryou.

795
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,475
You've been so kind.
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.

796
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,510
I can't tell you how touched I am

797
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,471
by your concern for my welfare.

798
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,714
I hope you knowthat I'm your friend, Sansa.

799
00:49:51,479 --> 00:49:53,197
Your true friend.

800
00:49:53,279 --> 00:49:54,394
I do, Lord Baelish.

801
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,749
Petyr.

802
00:49:55,879 --> 00:49:56,994
Petyr.

803
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:01,834
lfyou wish to stay,
then of course you will stay.

804
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,028
We'll speak again when | return.

805
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,239
(EXHALES)

806
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,079
TYWlN: You're late.

807
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:25,791
What's she doing here?

808
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,192
Our business concerns her, too.

809
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,788
Sit.

810
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,115
You'll be pleased to learn that

811
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,390
after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,

812
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:41,072
I've saved the crown
hundreds ofthousands on this wedding.

813
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:43,627
Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.

814
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:45,869
l'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

815
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:50,071
Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.

816
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,038
Your sister has learned
that your new friends the Tyrells

817
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,873
are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

818
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,238
Very well. She's a lovely girl.

819
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:03,269
Missing some of Loras'
favourite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.

820
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,553
Yourjokes are not appreciated.

821
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:05,873
It wasn't my best, but...

822
00:51:05,959 --> 00:51:08,917
I bring them into
the royal fold, and this is how they repay me,

823
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:11,559
bytrying to steal
the key to the North out from under me.

824
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,079
Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to
remember she has an older brother.

825
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,911
The Karstarks have marched home.

826
00:51:17,999 --> 00:51:20,991
The Young Wolf has
lost half his army. His days are numbered.

827
00:51:21,439 --> 00:51:23,794
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.

828
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:27,110
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell,

829
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:30,836
and lam not about
to hand her over to the Tyrells.

830
00:51:30,919 --> 00:51:33,114
TYRlON: The Tyrell army is
helping us to win this war.

831
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,676
Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

832
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,591
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.

833
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,230
Plots are not public knowledge.

834
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,073
And the Tyrells won't carry this one out
until after Joffrey's wedding.

835
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,675
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

836
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:49,073
And how do we do that?

837
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:51,229
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

838
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:52,434
Wonderful.

839
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,709
Yes, it is.

840
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:02,628
You can't mean it.

841
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:03,953
I can and I do.

842
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,633
Joffrey's made this poor girl's life miserable

843
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:09,398
since the day he took her father's head.

844
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:11,947
Now she's finally
free of him, and you give her to me?

845
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:13,313
That's cruel, even for you.

846
00:52:13,479 --> 00:52:14,753
Do you intend on mistreating her?

847
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:18,278
The girl's happiness
is not my concern, nor yours.

848
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,588
She'sachild!

849
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,273
She's flowered, I assure
you. She and l have discussed it at length.

850
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:23,838
There, you see? You will wed her,

851
00:52:23,959 --> 00:52:25,438
bed her, and put a child in her.

852
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:27,227
Surely you're capable of that.

853
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:28,547
And if! refuse?

854
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:35,358
Sansa Stark is a finer
reward than you could ever dare hope for.

855
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,476
And it is past time you were wed.

856
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,992
l was wed.

857
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,952
Or don't you remember?

858
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:45,872
Only too well.

859
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,993
You should be thanking the Gods forthis.
This is more than you deserve.

860
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,229
Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.

What do you mean?

863
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,518
You'll marry Ser Loras.

864
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:03,988
lwill not.

you will secure the Reach.

No, lwon't do it.

868
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,513
Yes, you will.

869
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:12,794

You need to marry again and breed.

You will do as I command,
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

and put an end to the disgusting
rumours about you once and for all.
