181
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,678
lfl remember correctly,

182
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,437
she never stole a necklace again. (LAUGHS)

183
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,960
It's not slander if it's true.

184
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,679
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

185
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,354
Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to Father?

186
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:07,555
Because you're a liar.

187
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,677
I expect you'll
tell lies about me, about Joffrey.

188
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,069
Any lies in particular?

189
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,153
(SIGHS) You're a clever man,

190
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,150
but not as clever as you think you are.

191
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,958
Mmm. Still makes me more clever than you.

193
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,594
Ah.

194
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,590
Look at these two shining warriors.

195

Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit ofWhocares.

196
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,912
Ser Meryn Trant.

197
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,351
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

198
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,111
-You're no knight.
-Pod.

199
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:43,270
Ser Bronn ofthe Blackwater
was anointed bythe king himself.

200
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:47,272
You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.

201
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,270
That's exactly who I am.

202
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,156
And you're a grub in fancy armour

203
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,356
who's better at
beating little girls than fighting men.

204
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,999
Now, l have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.

205
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,593
You put your hand on that door,

206
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,953
you lose the hand.

207
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,913
As much as I appreciate
awalk in the sunshine,

208
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,876
lam wondering why you sent for me.

209
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,349
Many people in this
city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.

210
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,592
I've been doing that for a while now.

211
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,874
Do you grow bored protecting me?

212
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,228
I grow poor protecting you.

213
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,710
Poor? Poor?

214
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,471
Under my patronage you've become a knight,

215
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,437
you've served as Commander
ofthe City Watch.

216
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,748
Briefly.

217
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,147
I'm sure you filled your pockets.

218
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,195
And now my pockets are empty.

219
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,430
You've given me a taste for the finer things.

220
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,829
And ifyou want me
protecting you, you'll need to pay more.

221
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:47,954
I thought we were friends.

222
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,114
We are.

223
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,310
But I'm a sellsword. | sell my sword.

224
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,510
I don't loan it out to friends as a favour.

225
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,918
-How much?
-Double.

226
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:55,988
Double?

227
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,114
I'm a knight now.

228
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,474
Knights are worth double.

229
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,835
I don't even know
how much I'm paying you now.

230
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,875
Which means you can afford it.

240
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,398
l was in the battle at Blackwater.

241
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,236
l was a captain and a knight.

242
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,118
Aye, ser, and serving which king?

243
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,919
The one true king of Westeros,

244
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:42,710
Stannis Baratheon.

245
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,397
I thought you were dead.

246
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,834
Everyone thought you were dead.

247
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,109
And your son?

248
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,157
He may have swam ashore as you did.

249
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:12,158
No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

250
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,079
I'm so sorry, my friend.

251
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,518
I, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.

252
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,796
But, Davos, you were a good father.

253
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:37,597
If I was a good father, he'd still be here.

254
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,637
Stannis lives?

255
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,038
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

256
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,519
Will you take me there?

257
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,629
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

258
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,152
This war is not over.

259
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:53,232
Not foryou, maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

260
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,072
We're both sworn to King Stannis.

261
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,390
lam sworn to no man.

262
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:01,108
I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me riches and glory.

263
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,553
I delivered the ships.

264
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,710
Stannis never gives up. Never.

265
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,869
Now he will regroup...

266
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,114
He's a broken man.

267
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,555
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

268
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:12,836
They say he sees no one,
not his generals, not even his wife.

00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,074
What?

272
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:26,674
They built a great fire when Stannis returned.

273
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,880
All those who spoke
against her she called servants of darkness.

274
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,632
They say she sang to them as they burned.

You're a smuggler. Servants of darkness.

I'm thinking Dragonstone
is a good place for us to avoid.

278

Take me back there, please.

279
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,628
(SCOFFS) You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

280
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:55,789
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

281
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:56,994

a little longer, my friend.

287

And you drank with me on four of mine,

288
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,836
but I don't ask you for favours.

289
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,918
l have to stop her. Please, do this for me.

wear them around her neck.

We should set

294

There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

295
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,237
The Mountain will defend
whatever Tywin Lannister tells him.

296
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,595
The Lannisters
have been running from us since Oxcross.

297
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,240

362

Jaime is your eldest son,
heirto your lands and titles.

366

But he is a Kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

367

368
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:22,109

You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

385

full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

387
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,748
Men's laws give you the right to bear my
name and display my colours

388
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,672
since I cannot prove that you are not mine.

389
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,634

the Gods have condemned me

390
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:39,029

wearing that proud lion

391

and his father's before him.

back wine in exchange.

But it's not coming back.

405
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,675
The captain's tired of risking his life

406
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,751
so King's Landing lords and ladies

407
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:49,956

on better wine than they deserve.

408
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,151

410

who weren't so beautiful and warm.

Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.

That's not how the game works.

418
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,836
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

419
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,629
You've got to invent a story about
where the ship is going and why.

420
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,632
Why should I make up a story
when l knowthe truth?

421
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,995
Because the truth
is always either terrible or boring.

436
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,716
Because I'm a terrible liar.

Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

439
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:42,069
I'm waiting for word on an assignment
that will take me far away from the capital.

440

I might be able to take you with me.

441

be ready to leave on a moment's notice.
