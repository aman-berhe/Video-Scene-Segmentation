and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered that you were brothers.

beside my brother, Lady Stark.

The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

417
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,872
Old men deny it with their death rattle

418
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,189
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

419

420

is a man without power.

I will give you this one night to reconsider.

your old seat in the Council.

429
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,352
Can you see all those banners?

430
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,749

will make you king?

432
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,878

will make me king.

We shall see, Renly.

434

Come the dawn, we shall see.

435
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,669
Lookto your sins, Lord Renly.

436
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,751
The night is dark and full ofterrors.

I thought we were welcome.

was approaching your city,

440
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,711

444
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,279
You know me, my lord?

445

Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

446
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,711
And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.

448
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,673
And what should I call you?

449
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,308
Oh, my name is quite long

450
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:41,959
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

451
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,919
lam simply a trader of spices.

452
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,199
But we are the Thirteen,

453
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:52,030
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

454
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,118

457
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,231
Might we see the dragons?

458
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,835
My friend,

459
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,951
we have travelled very far.

460
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,156
We have no food, no water.

461
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,788
Once I see my people fed,
lwould be honoured...

462
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,150
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

463
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,837
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

464
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,596
Some of my more sceptical friends

465
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,752
refuse to believe your children

466
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,759
even exist.

467
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,718
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

468
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,949
lam not a liar.

469
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,995
Oh, I don't think you are.

470
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,519
But as I've never met you before,

471
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:47,067
my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

472
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,872
Where I come from,

473
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,629
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

474
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:59,870
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

475
00:32:59,959 --> 00:33:01,517
We wish you well.

476
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,951
What are you doing?

477
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,270
You promised to receive me.

478
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:11,998
We have received you.

479
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,235
Here we are, and here you are.

480
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,276
lfyou do not let us in, all of us will die.

481
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,629
Which we shall deeply regret.

482
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:24,072
But Qarth did not become
the greatest city that ever was or will be

483
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,277
by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

484
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,388
Khaleesi, please be careful.

485
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,149
Thirteen!

486
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,038
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me

487
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,236
and destroy those who have wronged me.

488
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,711
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

489
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,950
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

490
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,719
Ah.

491
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,029
You are a true Targaryen.

492
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,958
Only, as you said a moment ago,

493
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,349
ifwe don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

494
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,069
And so...

495
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,755
Retreating in fear from a little girl
is unbecoming ofthe greatest city

496
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,239

and lam still speaking.

501
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:28,955
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

502
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,838
and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

503
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,069
She is the Mother of Dragons.

504
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:39,189
Do you expect her to watch her people starve
without breathing fire?

505
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,869
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki

506
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:44,393
through our gates without dooming our city.

507
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,435
After all, here I am,

508
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,195
a savage from the Summer Isles,
and Qarth still stands.

509
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,677
Our decision is final.

510
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,834
Very well.

512
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,914
I will vouch for her, her people,

00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,712
POLLIVER: This lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.

528
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:19,438
After we interrogate 'em, we usuallyjust...

529
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,033
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

530
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,156
able young bodies and skilled labourers?

531
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,914
You, do you have a trade?

532
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,589
GENDRY: Smith, my lord.

533
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,277
What are you looking at? Kneel!

534
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,953
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

535
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,230
He'll do no such thing.

536
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,429
This one's a girl, you idiot,

537
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,435
dressed as a boy.

538
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,196
-Why?
-Safer to travel, my lord.

539
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,194
Smart.

540
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,159
More than I can say forthis lot.

541
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,075
Get these prisoners to work.

542
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,349
Bring the girl.

543
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,189
MOUNTAIN: My lord.

544
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:12,673
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

545
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,277
Your visits are too few, cousin.

546
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,827
Her Grace, the Queen Regent,

547
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:24,194
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

548
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,516
-Here's yourwarrant.
-So it is.

549
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,556
Will you take a cup with me?

550
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,440
| find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

551
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,672
lam here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, lmp.

552
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,358
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

553
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,952
I would have thought she'd come herself.

554
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:44,391
Instead she sends you.
What am | to make ofthat?

555
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,151
I don't care what you make of it,

556
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,799
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

557
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,429
And you've received
these instructions directly from Cersei?

558
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,671
As I said several times.

559
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,399
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

560
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,713
When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
I carry it out without delay.

561
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,236
Cersei must have great trust in you,

562
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,709
allowing you into her chamber
during the hour ofthe wolf.

563
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,714
The Queen Regent has
a great many responsibilities.

564
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,233
She often works from dusk till dawn.

565
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,359
She must be very glad to have you helping her
from dusktill dawn.

566
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,949
Ah.

567
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,154
Lavender oil.

568
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,548
She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

569
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,072
lam a knight!

570
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:33,636
An anointed knight, yes.

571
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,356
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

572
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:41,915
What? Nothing to say?

573
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,033
No more warnings for me, ser?

574
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,758
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

575
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,276
Have you ever given any thought
to what King Joffrey will have to say

576
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,318
when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?

577
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,667
It's not my fault!

578
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:00,227
Did she take you against your will?

579
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,232
Can you not defend yourself, knight?

580
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,392
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when l was named the king's squire,

581
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,471
he told me to obey her in everything.

582
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,312
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

583
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:12,277
| only meant I did as l was bid.

584
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:13,991
Hated every moment of it,

585
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,752
is that what you'll have me believe?

586
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,990
A high place in court, a knighthood,

587
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,196
my sister's legs spreading
open foryou at night.

588
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,350
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.

589
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,271
Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

590
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,268
-Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
-Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

591
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,830
My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
the queen.

592
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,551
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

593
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,631
-No, I think not.
-My lord?

594
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:37,474
You heard me.

595
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,311
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.

596
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:46,953
Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.

597
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,429
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

598
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,798
No one ever need know,
as long as you keep faith with me.

599
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,836
I want to know what Cersei is doing,

600
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,636
where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.

601
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:04,914
And you will tell me.

602
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,313
Yes, my lord, lwill.

603
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,359
I swear it, as you command.

604
00:41:12,479 --> 00:41:14,515
Oh, rise, rise.

605
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,880
Let us drink to our understanding.

606
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,388
Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.

607
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:24,992
Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman,
and it's all for the good ofthe realm.

608
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,474
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

609
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,516
that I want no more conflict between us

610
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,070
and that, henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.

611
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,353
But her demands?

612
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,916
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

613
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,516
-You will?
-Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

614
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,990
Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but I will not have him on the Council.

615
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,788
I could swearthat I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

616
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,917
but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.

617
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,438
(WOOD CREAKING)

619
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,754
Your Grace.

620
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,269
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

621
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,231
Well, life's been good
since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

622
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,351
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

623
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,271
-Fewer.
-Pardon?

624
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,391
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

625
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:32,918
Never understood why you had to wear them.

626
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,635
It reminds me of where I come from
and where I am now.

627
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,593
It reminds me of yourjustice.

628
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,240
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

629
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,515
You were a hero and a smuggler.

630
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,908
A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad the good.

632
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,750
-Does he listen?
-To me?

633
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,034
Gods, no.

634
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,834
But ifyour red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest...

635
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,559
She has a name.

636
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:07,558
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

637
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,552
I've lived within the law for 17...

638
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:13,755
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

639
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:16,232
Any shore, any night.

640
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,114
What am | bringing ashore?

641
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,632
The red woman.

642
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,115
No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak ofthis again.

643

lam true to Your Grace and always will be,

644
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,236
but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

645
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,909
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

646
00:44:02,479 --> 00:44:04,595
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

647
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,951
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full ofterrors.

648
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,233
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

649
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,952
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

650
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,271
I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.

651
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,872
lf half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

652
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,150
A man is good or he is evil.

653
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:33,997
-And which are you?
-Oh, good.

654
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,949
I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.

655
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,590
Well, that must be very nice for you.

656
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,113
-Do you love your wife?
-I do.

657
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:04,915
Yet you have known otherwomen.

658
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,638
Don't talk about my wife.

659
00:45:06,759 --> 00:45:09,319
I'm not. I'm talking about otherwomen.

660
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,557
Like me, Ser Davos.

661
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,473
You want me.

662
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:21,354
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

663
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,359
And you will.

664
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,311
Strange that this Lord of Light
asks you to work in the shadows.

665
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,558
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

666
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,555
They are servants of light, the children of fire.

667
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:46,710
And the brighter the flame,
the darkerthey are.

668
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,189
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

669
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:52,875
They can't bar our passage.

670
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,393
Gods protect us.

671
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,995
There's only one god, Ser Davos,

672
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:05,509
and he only protects those who serve him.
