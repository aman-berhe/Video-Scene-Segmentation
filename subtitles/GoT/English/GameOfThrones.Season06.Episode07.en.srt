You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

201

I delivered an army of fanatics
onto our doorstep.

202
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,676
And now we must fight them together.

It's the onlytruth I know.

213
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,558
We must defend them.

214

Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

351
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,437
made that man his steward.

352
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,152
He chose Jon to be his successor

353
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,470
because he knew
he had the courage to do what was right,

354
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,715
even if it meant giving his life.

355
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,916
Because Jeor Mormont
and Jon Snow both understood

356
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,037
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

357
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,549
lt's between the living and the dead.

358
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,990
And make no mistake, my lady,

359
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,993
the dead are coming.

360
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,668
Is this true?

361
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,354
Your uncle fought them
at the Fist ofthe First Men.

362
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,919
I fought them at Hardhome.

363
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,319
We both lost.

364
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,076
As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell,
the North is divided.

365
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,596
And a divided North won't stand a chance
against the Night King.

366
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,675
You want to protect your people, my lady.
I understand.

367
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,116
But there's no hiding from this.

368
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,999
We have to fight,

369
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,515
and we need to do it together.

370
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,950
House Mormont has kept faith
with House Stark for 1,000 years.

371
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,072
We will not break faith today.

372
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,878
Thank you, my lady.

373
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,790
How many fighting men can we expect?

374
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,588
S ixty-two.

375
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,547
-Sixty-two?
-We are not a large house,

376
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,993
but we're a proud one.

377
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,197
And every man from Bear Island
fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.

378
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,992
lfthey're half as ferocious as their lady,
the Boltons are doomed.

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,997
You'll force me to storm the castle.

397
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,398

426

Now you want me to fight against them?

427
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,197
