1
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,029
(Fanfare)

2
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,032
(Crow saws)

3
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,151
(Man yells)

4
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,190
(Horse neighs)
(Man shouting)

5
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,432
"Summoned to court
to answer for the crimes

6
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,513
"of your bannerrnan Gregor Clegane,
the Mountain." Er...

7
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:09,076
"Arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown."

8
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,747
Poor Ned Stark.

9
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,269
Brave man, terrible judgment.

10
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,229
Attacking him was stupid.

11
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,070
(Grunts)

12
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,473
Lannisters...

13
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,998
don‘t act like fools.

14
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,711
Are you going to say something clever?

15
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,435
Go on, say something clever.

16
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,272
Oatelyn Stark took my brother.

17
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,594
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,277
Ned Stark.

19
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,038
One of our men interfered,

20
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,271
speared him through the leg
before I could ﬁnish him.

21
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,356
Why is he still alive?

22
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,391
It wouldn‘t have been clean.

23
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,873
Clean.

24
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,038
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

25
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,071
I could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

26
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,112
That's what you want
people to think of you.

27
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,388
It's the truth.

28
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,154
When you hear them whispering
"kingslayer" behind your back

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,157
doesn‘t it bother you?

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,316
Of course it bothers me.

31
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,236
A lion doesn‘t concern himself

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,237
with the opinions of the sheep.

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,196
I suppose I should be grateful
that your vanity

34
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,275
got in the way
of your recklessness.

35
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,309
I'm giving you half of our forces -

36
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,758
30,000 men.

37
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,429
You will bring them to Oatelyn Starks
girlhood home

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,835
and remind her that Lannisters

39
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,796
pay their debts.

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,873
I didn‘t realise you placed such
a high value on my brother‘s life.

41
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,308
He's a Lannister.

42
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,637
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

43
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,069
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,953
the less our name commands respect.

45
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,035
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,475
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,235
If another house
can seize one of our own

48
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,833
and hold him captive with impunity,

49
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,110
we are no longer a house to be feared.

50
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,471
Your mother‘s dead.

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,591
Before long I'll be dead.

52
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,438
And you...

53
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,630
and your brother
and your sister

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,199
and all of her children.

55
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,392
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

56
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,793
It's the family name that lives on.

57
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,189
It's all that lives on.

58
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,231
Not your personal glory,
not your honour,

59
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,111
but family.

60
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,193
Do you understand?

61
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,997
Hmm.

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,470
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,559
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

64
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,358
And you're still blessed with youth.

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,717
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

66
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,149
You've served as a gloriﬁed
bodyguard for two kings -

67
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,595
one a madman,
the other a drunk

68
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,235
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

69
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:43,238
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

70
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,595
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

71
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,030
I need you to bmome the man
you were always meant to be.

72
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,156
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

73
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,758
Now.

74
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:20,754
(Bell tolling)

75
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,471
You're in pain.

76
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,190
I've had worse, my lady.

77
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,430
Perhaps it's time to go home.

78
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,278
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

79
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,748
I know the tnrth Jon Arryn died for.

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,631
Do you, Lord Stark?

81
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,073
Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

82
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,470
Has he done this before?

83
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,709
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

84
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,353
Your brother...

85
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,707
or your lover?

86
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,834
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

87
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,349
to keep bloodlines pure.

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,436
Jaime and l are more
than brother and sister.

89
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,596
We shared a womb.

90
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,438
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,311
My son saw you with him.

92
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,953
Do you love your children?

93
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,877
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.

94
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,991
- And they're all Jaime's.
- (Chuckles) Thank the gods.

95
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,515
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

96
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,357
I ﬁnish him off in other ways.

97
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,074
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

98
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,236
Hated him? I worshipped him.

99
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,876
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

100
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:54,753
And when I ﬁnally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

101
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,517
lean and ﬁerce and black-bearded,

102
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,710
it was the happiest moment of my life.

103
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,470
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

104
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,318
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

105
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,395
and whispered in my ear, "Lyanna."

106
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,635
Your sister was a corpse
and l was a living girl

107
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,671
and he loved her more than me.

108
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,998
When the king returns from his hunt,
I'll tell him the tnrth.

109
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,192
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

110
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,880
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

111
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,308
Go as far away as you can,

112
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,556
with as many men as you can.

113
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,910
Because wherever you go,

114
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,190
Robert's wrath will follow you.

115
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,913
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

116
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,190
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

117
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,038
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

118
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,833
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

119
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,190
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

120
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,879
Such a sad mistake.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,355
I've made many mistakes in my life...

122
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,918
but that wasn't one of them.

123
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,519
Oh, but it was.

124
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,709
When you play the game of thrones,
you win...

125
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,193
or you die.

126
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,070
There is no middle ground.

127
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,790
- (Children laughing)
- Come here.

128
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,748
(Children crying)

129
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,070
(D09 barking)

130
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,395
(Woman moaning)

131
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,318
Oh, yesl Oh, yesl

132
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,436
(Woman laughs and moans)

133
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,435
Ohl

134
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,273
Oh, yesl Ohl Ohl

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,197
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Ohl

136
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,757
Oh, yesl Oh, yesl

137
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,273
Ohl

138
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,119
No, no, no, nol

139
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,349
Is that what they teach you
up in the North?

140
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,989
And you -
wherever you're from -

141
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,873
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

142
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,151
Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?

143
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,831
Yes, my lord.

144
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,115
Lets start over, shall we?

145
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,516
You be the man...

146
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,517
and you be the woman.

147
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,158
Well, go ahead.

148
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,591
Slowly.

149
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,792
(Soft moaning)

150
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,632
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

151
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:46,155
They know it's all just an act.

152
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,919
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

153
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,031
Now, that takes time.

154
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,756
You need to...

155
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,676
easeinto it.

156
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,678
Go ahead.

157
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,311
Easeinto it.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,397
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

159
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,232
You're starting to like this.

160
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,117
He wants to believe you.

161
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,989
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

162
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,152
He knows he's better
than other men.

163
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,555
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

164
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,076
He's so good,

165
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:36,715
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

166
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,307
overcoming your very nature.

167
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,475
Why don't you join us, my lord?

168
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm saving myself for another.

169
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,477
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

170
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,511
- A stupid saying.
- (Moans)

171
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,517
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

172
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,913
(Moans)

173
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,871
She must be very beautiful.

174
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,515
No, not really.
lmpewable bloodlines though.

175
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,510
I do believe my lord's in love.

176
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,870
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

177
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,154
Play with her arse.

178
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,310
And she loved me too.

179
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,667
l was her little conﬁdant, her plaything.

180
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,632
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

181
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,435
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

182
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,754
the castle that she wanted to live in

183
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,632
and the man that she wanted to marry -

184
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,876
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

185
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,991
- (Moaning)
- So I challenged him to a duel.

186
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,792
I mean, why not?
I'd read all the stories.

187
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,428
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

188
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,791
In the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

189
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,235
"He's just a boy," she said.

190
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,190
"Please don't hurt him."

191
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,829
So he gave me a nice little soar
to remember him by, and off they went.

192
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,598
Is she still married to him?

193
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,518
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

194
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,436
(Gasping loudly)

195
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,154
..and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

196
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,748
She loves him, I'm afraid.

197
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,269
And why wouldn't she?
I mean, who could compare to him?

198
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,516
- He's just so...
- (Shrieks and moans)

199
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,311
(Moaning)
(Laughs)

200
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,875
(Moaning, sighing)

201
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,713
..good.

202
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,508
Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?

203
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,672
I learned that I'll never win, not that way.

204
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,596
That's their game,

205
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,154
their rules.

206
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,157
I'm not going to ﬁght them.

207
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,317
I'm going to fuck them.
That's what I know.

208
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:39,475
That's what I am.

209
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,312
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

210
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,590
And what do you want?

211
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,154
Oh, everything, my dear.

212
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,991
Everything there is.

213
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,758
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

214
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,479
Hmm.

215
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,790
(FOOMGPS)

216
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,909
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

217
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,436
Where I come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

218
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,074
Where I come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

219
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,316
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

220
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,193
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

221
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,708
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

222
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,276
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

223
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,231
Where is it you come from?

224
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,350
The Iron Islands.

225
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,469
They far away?

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,875
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

227
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,469
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

228
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,789
"Trust me, my lord."

229
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,714
You're not living in the wildemess anymore.

230
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,989
ln civilised lands,
you refer to your betters

231
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,110
by their proper titles.

232
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:19,753
- And what's that?
- Lord.

233
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,633
Why?

234
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,271
Why?

235
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,231
What do you mean, why?

236
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,431
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

237
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,072
What's that got to do with you?

238
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,913
If your father's lord,

239
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,837
how can you be lord too?

240
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,238
- I will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord nom

241
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,111
No, you...

242
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,790
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

243
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,593
I just don't understand
how you southemers do things.

244
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:52,836
- I'm not a southemer.
- You're from south of the Wall.

245
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,869
That makes you a southemer to me.

246
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,634
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

247
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,391
Couldn't say, my lord.

248
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,351
Don't know what "impunent" means.

249
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,277
Impudent.

250
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,596
It means rude, disrespectful.

251
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,631
Do you want to lose that chain?

252
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,829
Theon Greyjoyl

253
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,268
The lady is our guest.

254
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,190
I thought she was our prisoner.

255
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,795
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

256
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,677
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

257
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,471
I'm used to worse than him.

258
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,555
Hmm?

259
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,273
I'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

260
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,709
and pick their teeth with his bones.

261
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,319
(Chuckles)

262
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,992
Why did you come here?

263
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,990
Didn't mean to come here.

264
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,876
Meant to get much further south than this.

265
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,757
As far south as south goes,

266
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,909
before the long night comes.

267
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,638
Why? What are you afraid 0|?

268
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:14,672
There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

269
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:19,155
- Owls and shadowcats...
- I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.

270
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:25,469
The things you speak of -

271
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,954
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

272
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,831
They wasn't gone, old man.

273
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,598
They was sleeping.

274
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,070
And they ain't sleeping no more.

275
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,234
(Sanrwell) I miss girls.

276
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,953
Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.

277
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,433
Just looking at them,

278
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,998
hearing them giggle.

279
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,398
Don't you miss girls?

280
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,388
Riders.

281
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,714
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

282
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,911
Why is he alone?

283
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,069
One blast for a ranger returning,

284
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,918
two for wildlings,

285
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:24,035
- three for...
- There's no rider.

286
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,357
(Creaking)

287
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,990
(Neighs, snorts)

288
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,712
(Neighs)

289
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,918
- (Neighs)
- Whoa, boy, whoa.

290
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,990
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

291
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,311
(Neighing continues)

292
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,710
Where's my uncle?

293
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,237
Nedl

294
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:17,832
It's Robert.
We were hunting...

295
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,677
a boar...

296
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:29,554
(Robert) I should have
spent more time with you,

297
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:32,279
shown you how to be a man.

298
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,874
I was never meant to be a father.

299
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,356
Go on.

300
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,475
You don't want to see this.

301
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,029
My fault.

302
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,357
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

303
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,397
(Robert) It stinks.

304
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,547
It stinks like death.

305
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,353
Don't think I can't smell it.

306
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,515
(Robert laughs)

307
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,598
I paid the bastard back. Ned.

308
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,874
I drove my knife
right through his brain.

309
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,308
You ask 'em if I didn't. Ask 'eml

310
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,115
I want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

311
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,590
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

312
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,272
Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.

313
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,430
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of youl

314
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,596
(Coughing)

315
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,195
You damned fool.

316
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,356
Paper and ink on the table.

317
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,629
Write down what I say.

318
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,798
"In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

319
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,989
"ﬁrst of..."

320
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,598
You know how it goes.

321
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,153
Fill in the damn titles.

322
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,236
"I hereby command

323
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,998
"Eddard of House Stark..."

324
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,474
titles, titles...

325
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,875
"to serve as Lord Regent
and Protector of the Realm

326
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,036
"upon my death,

327
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,958
"to rule in my stead

328
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,468
"until my son Joffrey comes of age."

329
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,673
Give it over.

330
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,672
Give it to the council...

331
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,312
after I'm dead.

332
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,630
At least they'll say I did this light,

333
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,030
this one thing.

334
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,832
You'll rule now.

335
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,548
You'll hate it worse than I did...

336
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:01,515
but you'll do it well.

337
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,189
The girl...

338
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,793
Daenerys.

339
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,592
You were right.
Varys, Littleﬁnger,

340
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:16,472
my brother... worthless.

341
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,749
No one to tell me "no" but you.

342
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,108
Only you.

343
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,990
Let her live.

344
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,195
Stop it, if it's not too late.

345
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,911


346
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,229
And my son...

347
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,632
help him, Ned.

348
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:40,955
Make him better than me.

349
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,910


350
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:47,517
I'll do everything I can
to honour your memory.

351
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:50,790
My memory. (Laughs, coughs)

352
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,430
King Robert Baratheon,

353
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,630
murdered by a pig.

354
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,431
(Who-cs, coughs)

355
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,549
Give me something for the pain
and let me die.

356
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,711
Give him milk of the poppy.

357
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,350
He was reeling from the wine.

358
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,992
(Door closes)

359
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,990
He commanded us to...

360
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,348
step aside, but...

361
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,472
I failed him.

362
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,273
No man could have
protected him from himself.

363
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,952
I wonder, Ser Barristan,

364
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,759
who gave the king this wine?

365
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:53,718
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

366
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:56,347
His squire? The Lannister boy?

367
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,469
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

368
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,915
did not lack refreshment.

369
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,356
I do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

370
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,589
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

371
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,239
Whatever arrangements you made...

372
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,634
unmake them. At once.

373
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,915
I'm afraid those birds have ﬂown.

374
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,950
The girl is likely dead already.

375
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:44,756
The stallion who mounts
the world has no need for iron chairs.

376
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,358
Amording to the prophecy...

377
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,788
...the stallion will ride
to the ends of the earth.

378
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,354
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

379
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,316
No horse can cross the poison water.

380
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,471
The earth does not end at the sea...

381
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,829
...there are many dirts beyond the sea.

382
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,150
The dirt where I was born.

383
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:05,557
Not dirts. Lands.

384
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:07,869
Lands, yes. . .

385
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,591
There are thousands of ships
in the free cities.

386
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,590
Wooden horses that ﬂy across the sea...

387
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:17,234
Lets speak no more of wooden horses
and iron chairs.

388
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,998
It's not a chair. It's a...

389
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,119
(Speaks English) ..throne.

390
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,594
(Speaks English) Throne.

391
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,758
A chair for a King to sit upon,

392
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,433
or...

393
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,151
...a Queen.

394
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,672
(He groans)

395
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,592
A King does not need a chair to sit upon.

396
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:48,392
He only needs a horse.

397
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:01,714
(Chatter, music, traders calling)

398
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,789
Can't you help me
make him understand?

399
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,434
The Dothraki do things in their own time,
for their own reasons.

400
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,950
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, I promise you.

401
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,075
My brother was a fool, I know,

402
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,634
but he was the rightful heir
to the Seven Kingdoms.

403
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,193
(Chuckles)

404
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,992
Have I said something funny, ser?

405
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,917
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

406
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,429
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms
bwause they were his right.

407
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,279
He had no right to them.
He seized them bwause he could.

408
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,758
And bwause he had dragons.

409
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:36,518
Ah, well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.

410
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:41,269
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

411
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:44,072
I believe what my eyes
and ears report.

412
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,668
As for the rest...
it was 300 years ago.

413
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,437
Who knows what really happened?

414
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,755
Now if you'll pardon me,
I'll seek out the merchant captain,

415
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,471
see if he has any letters for me.

416
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,193
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, don't trouble yourself.

417
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,073
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

418
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:08,471
Psstl Jorah the Andal.

419
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,636
The Spider sends his greetings

420
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,750
and his congratulations.

421
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,517
A royal pardon.
You can go home now.

422
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,715
(Merchant calling in Dothraki)

423
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,996
Sweet reds...

424
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:41,427
I have sweet reds from Lys,
Volantis and the Arborl

425
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,154
Tyroshi pear brandyl Andalish soursl

426
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,555
I have theml I have theml

427
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,031
A taste for the Khaleesi?

428
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,914
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

429
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,635
One taste and you'll
name your ﬁrst child after me.

430
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:01,591
(Speaks English) My son already has
his name, but I'll try your summerwine.

431
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:02,868
Just a taste.

432
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,868
My lady, you are from Westeros.

433
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:08,797
You have the honour of addressing Daenerys
of the House Targaryen.

434
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:13,836
Khaleesi of the Riding Men
and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

435
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,836
- Princess.
- Rise.

436
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,870
I'd still like to taste that wine.

437
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:21,073
That? Domish swill.

438
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,469
Not worthy of a princess.

439
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,749
IhaveadryredfromtheArbor-

440
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,711
nectar of the gods.

441
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:30,393
Let me give you a cask
A... Agift.

442
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,919
You honour me, ser.

443
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,315
The honour...
the honour is all mine.

444
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,158
(Man) Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

445
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:42,756
You know, there are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, Princess.

446
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,438
I hope to repay
your kindness someday.

447
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,878
Rakharo.

448
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,911
Put down that cask

449
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,115
- Is something wrong?
- I have a thirst.

450
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,997
Open it.

451
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,547
The wine is for the khaleesi.
It's not for the likes of you.

452
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,868
Open it.

453
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,513
Pour.

454
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:12,550
It would be a crime
to drink a wine this rich

455
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,558
- without at least giving it time to breathe.
- Do as he says.

456
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,118
As the princess commands.

457
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,031
Sweet, isn't it?

458
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,237
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

459
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,238
Taste it, my lord.

460
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,034
Tell me that that is not the ﬁnest wine
that has ever touched your tongue.

461
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,559
You ﬁrst.

462
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:49,478
Me?

463
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,914
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.

464
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,350
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant
who would drink up his own wares.

465
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,117
You will drink

466
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,672
(Grunting, shouting)

467
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,869
Stop himl

468
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:20,597
(Grunts)

469
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,309
(Men shouting)

470
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,317
(Growls)

471
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,439
Come.

472
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,951
(Spills)

473
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,112
- You came to us as outlaws...
- (Thunder)

474
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,237
..poachers, rapers,

475
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,315
killers, thieves.

476
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:47,915
You came alone, in chains,

477
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,631
without ﬁiends

478
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:51,789
or honour.

479
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,196
You came to us rich
and you came to us poor.

480
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,595
- (Thunder)
- Some of you bear the names

481
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,516
of proud Houses,

482
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,158
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

483
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,958
It does not matter.

484
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,957
All that is in the past.

485
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,917
Here...

486
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,868
on the Wall...

487
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,274
we are all one House.

488
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:19,516
- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.

489
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:23,233
You're going to be a ranger.

490
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,395
Isn't that what you always wanted?

491
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,788
I want to ﬁnd my uncle.

492
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:31,949
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.

493
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,789
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no ranger.

494
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:38,796
It's the steward's life for me.

495
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,790
There's honour in being a steward.

496
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,198
Not much, really.

497
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,719
But there's food.

498
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,278
Here...you begin anew.

499
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,875
A man of the Night's Watch...

500
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:07,198
lives his life for the realm.

501
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,471
Not for a king...

502
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:13,272
or a lord, or the honour of this House

503
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,630
or that House,

504
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,394
not for gold or glory,

505
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,749
or a woman's love,

506
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,757
but for the realm

507
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
and all the people in it.

508
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,870
You've all Ieamed
the words of the vow.

509
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:31,834
Think refucally before you say them.

510
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,631
The penalty for desertion...

511
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,988
is death.

512
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,470
You can take your vows here...

513
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,231
tonight...

514
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,588
at sunset.

515
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,793
Do any of you still keep the old gods?

516
00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:54,751
I do, my lord.

517
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,111
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

518
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,228
Yes, my lord.

519
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,112
You'll ﬁnd a weirwood
a mile north of the Wall.

520
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,912
And your old gods too, maybe.

521
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:08,832
My lord, might I go as well?

522
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,756
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

523
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,030
No, my lord.

524
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,590
I was named in the light of the Seven,

525
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,108
as my father was
and his father before him.

526
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,948
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

527
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:26,031
The Night's Watch is my House now.

528
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,548
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

529
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,836
Perhaps the old gods will.

530
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,558
As you wish, lad.

531
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,358
You've all been assigned an order,

532
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:41,152
awording to our needs

533
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,871
and your strengths.

534

Halder to the builders.

Pyp to the stewards.

Matthar to the rangers.

Rast to the rangers.

Jon to the stewards.

542
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,637
Rancer to the builder.

543
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:06,512
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

544
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,836

00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,837

00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:16,031
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

Nelugo to the rangers.

548
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,835
May all the gods preserve you.

549
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:28,833
Rangers with me.

550
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,352
Buildersl

551
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,951
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

552
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,834
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

553
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:02,430
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

554
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,269
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

555
00:36:06,399 --> 00:36:09,038
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

556
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,157
Make no comment about his nose.

557
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,267
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Morrnont

558
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,197
has requested you
for his personal steward.

559
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:23,751
Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

560
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,429
Certainly. And keep a ﬁre burning
in his chambers,

561
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,279
change his sheets
and blankets daily

562
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,869
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

563
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,273
Do you take me for a servant?

564
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:40,833
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

565
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:43,638
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

566
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,160
- May I go?
- As you wish.

567
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:56,513
Jon, waitl Don't you see
what they're doing?

568
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,436
I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

569
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,277
He wanted it and he got it.

570
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:02,708
Stewards are nothing but maidsl

571
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,796
I'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of youl

572
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,797
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

573
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,714
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

574
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,638
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock

575
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,389
I pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands out off for stealing their silver.

576
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,231
So now I'm here -
at the end of the world

577
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,999
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

578
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,917
I'll never see my family again.

579
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,031
I'll never be inside a woman again.

580
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:27,274
So don't tell me about fair.

581
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:30,994
I thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

582
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,033
Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

583
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,910
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.

584
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,438
Now listen to me.

585
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,676
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

586
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,511
You'll be with him day and night.

587
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,994
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

588
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,789
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

589
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:00,671
squire for him in battle.

590
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,270
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

591
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,878
And he asked for you himself.

592
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,548
He wants to groom you for command.

593
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,034
ljust...

594
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,952
I always wanted to be a ranger.

595
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,038
Ialwayswantedtobeawizard.

596
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:27,234
- (Laughs)
- What?

597
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,479
No, I'm serious.

598
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,034
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

599
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:41,476
Lord Stark...a moment.

600
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,550
Alone, if you will.

601
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,709
He named you Protector of the Realm.

602
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,838
He did.

603
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,517
She won't car'e.

604
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,915
Give me an hour and I can put
a hundred swords at your command.

605
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,711
And what should I do
with a hundred swords?

606
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,509
Strikel Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

607
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,910
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

608
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,668
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

609
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,676
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

610
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,552
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

611
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,351
What about Stannis?

612
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:28,551
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

613
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,278
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

614
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,912
Stannis is your older brother.

615
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,075
This isn't about the bloody
line of suwession.

616
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,112
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

617
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,036
What's best for the Kingdoms?

618
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,918
What's best for the people we rule?

619
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,428
We all know what Stannis is.

620
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,676
He inspires no love or loyalty.

621
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:54,391
He's not a king.

622
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,994


623
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,278
Stannis is a commander.

624
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,356
He's led men into war twice.

625
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,117
He destroyed the Greyjoy ﬁeet.

626
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,918
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

627
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,228
Tell me something.

628
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,634
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

629
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:27,671
I will not dishonour Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

630
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,109
and dragging ﬁightened children
from their beds.

631
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,799
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

632
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:48,387
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

633
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,717
Not his steward...

634
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,988
not his ptacain of the guard...

635
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,314
and not his wife.

636
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,718
Only Stannis himself.

637
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,592
- (Knocking)
- Yes, my lord.

638
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,154
Now leave us.

639
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,470
My Lord Protector.

640
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,791
The king has no truebom sons.

641
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,279
Joffrey and Tommen...

642
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:33,196
are Jaime Lannisters bastards.

643
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,478
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

644
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,312
Lord Stannis.

645
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:43,513
So it would seem.

646
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,436
- Unless...
- There is no "unless".

647
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,789
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

648
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,875
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

649
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,834
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey suweeds.

650
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,313
Do you have a shred of honour?

651
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:05,034
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

652
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,275
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

653
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,788
reach out and take it.

654
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,875
Make peace with the Lannisters.

655
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:15,309
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

656
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,998
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

657
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:21,390
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

658
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,670
we simply reveal his little secret

659
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,792
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

660
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,514
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
I assure you.

661
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,591
My price would be modest.

662
00:42:33,439 --> 00:42:35,589
What you suggest is treason.

663
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,710
Only if we lose.

664
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,834
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say...

665
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,310
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

666
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,715
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

667
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,950
That's why it's called "making peace".

668
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:55,156
No. I won't do it.

669
00:42:55,919 --> 00:42:57,671
So it will be Stannis and war?

670
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:59,875
There is no other choice.

671
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,279
He is the heir.

672
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,753
So why did you call me here?

673
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,836
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

674
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:10,390
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

675
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:13,192
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

676
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:16,994
enough to overwhelm what remains
of my household guard.

677
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,832
I need the gold cloaks.

678
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,990
The City Watch is 2,000 strong...

679
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,109
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

680
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,392
Look at you.

681
00:43:30,479 --> 00:43:32,435
You know what you want me to do,

682
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:34,475
you know it has to be done,

683
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,591
but it's not honourable, so...

684
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,992
the words stick in your throat.

685
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:41,989
When the queen proclaims one king

686
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,758
and the Hand proclaims another,

687
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,440
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

688
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,877
Who do they follow

689
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:56,511
The man who pays them.

690
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,311
(Rumbling, chains rattling)

691
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:02,230
(T hud)

692
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:05,391
(Rumbling, chains rattling)

693
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:10,554
(Barking)

694
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,390
(Wind whistling)

695
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,317
(Thunder)

696
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:44,237
(Jon and Sanrwell) Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow.

697
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:47,630
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

698
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,791
It shall not end until my death.

699
00:44:50,919 --> 00:44:53,069
I shall take no wife,

700
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,032
hold no lands,
father no children.

701
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,069
I shall wear no crowns
and win no glory.

702
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,669
I shall live and die at my post.

703
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,553
I am the sword in the darkness.

704
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:09,193
I am the watcher on the walls.

705
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,068
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

706
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:16,868
I pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

707
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,669
for this night
and all the nights to come.

708
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,831
You knelt as boys.

709
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:25,314
Rise now as men of the Night's Watch.

710
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,838
Well done. Well done.

711
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:48,231
What's he got there?

712
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,238
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.

713
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:55,549
Gods be goodl

714
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,791
What will they do to him?

715
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,035
When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle

716
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:12,549
and forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

717
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,431
And when he falls?

718
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,439
I saw a man last nine miles once.

719
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,150
King Robert still wants me dead.

720
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,429
This poisoner was the ﬁrst.
He won't be the last.

721
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,235
I thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.

722
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,874
He will never leave you alone.

723
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,157
If you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

724
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,589
If you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

725
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,918
He will never abandon the hunt.

726
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,748
You're a Targaryen -
the last Targaryen.

727
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,836
Your son will have Targaryen blood

728
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:49,393
with 40,!!!) riders behind him.

729
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:52,631
He will not have my son.

730
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,476
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.

731
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:18,311
(Whimpering)

732
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,917
Moon of my life.

733
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,912
Are you hurt?

734
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,838
Jorah the Andal.

735
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:45,598
I heard what you did.

736
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:49,109
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

737
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,953
I make this gift to you.

738
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,750
And to my son,
the stallion who will mount the world,

739
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,190
I will also pledge a gift.

740
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,312
I will give him the iron chair...

741
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:18,273
...that his mother's father sat upon.

742
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,958
I will give him Seven Kingdoms.

743
00:48:23,479 --> 00:48:27,836
I, Drogo, will do this.

744
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,557
I will take my Khalasar west
to where the world ends...

745
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,912
...and ride wooden horses
across the black salt water...

746
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,390
- ...as no Khal has done before.
- (Men cheering)

747
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:46,836
I will kill the men in iron suits...

748
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:49,837
- ...and tear down their stone houses.
- (Cheering)

749
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,754
- I will rape their women...
- (Cheering)

750
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,269
...take their children as slaves...

751
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:01,391
...and bring their broken gods
back to Vaes Dothrak

752
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,636
(Shouting and cheering)

753
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:07,110
This, I vow...

754
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,038
...I, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

755
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:11,433
(Cheering)

756
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,156
I swear before the Mother of Mountains...

757
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,032
...as the stars look down in witness.

758
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:22,472
As the stars look down in witness.

759
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:24,476
(Roaring and cheering)

760
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:46,787
(Grunts)

761
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:52,318
Lord Starkl

762
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:54,236
- Stopl
- (Ned) No, all right.

763
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,111
It's all right.
Let him through.

764
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:59,714
Lord Stark King Joffrey and the Queen Regent
request your presence in the Throne Room.

765
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,512
King Joffrey?

766
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,033
King Robert is gone.

767
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,230
The gods give him rest.

768
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,071
(Bells tolling)

769
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:18,714
All is awomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

770
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,431
Good.

771
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,111
ls Lord Renly joining us?

772
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,437
I fear Lord Renly has left the city.

773
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,317
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn

774
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:35,154
with Ser Loras Tyrell
and some 50 retainers.

775
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:38,629
Last seen galloping south
in some haste.

776
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:42,068
(Ned sighs)

777
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,595
We stand behind you, Lord Stark.

778
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,318
(Steward) All hail His Grace,

779
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:14,152
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon
and Lannister,

780
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,831
the First of His Name,

781
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:18,075
King of the Andals and the First Men,

782
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,354
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

783
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:23,431
and Protector of the Realm.

784
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,355
I command the council to make all nmessary
arrangements for my coronation.

785
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,953
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.

786
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,759
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty

787
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:51,676
from my loyal councillors.

788
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:56,718
Ser Barristan...

789
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:00,195
I believe no man here
could ever question your honour.

790
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:14,355
King Robert's seal - unbroken.

791
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:24,835
"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named...

792
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:26,671
"Protector of the Realm...

793
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:29,596
"to rule as regent...

794
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,228
"until the heir come of age."

795
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:35,515
May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?

796
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,239
Protector of the Realm.

797
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:52,073
Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

798
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,631
A pime of paper?

799
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:00,597
- Those were the king's words.
- We have a new king now.

800
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:06,311
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.

801
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:09,549
Allow me to return the courtesy.

802
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,750
Bend the knee, my lord.

803
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,673
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son...

804
00:53:15,479 --> 00:53:17,834
and we shall allow you
to live out your days

805
00:53:17,959 --> 00:53:20,473
in the grey waste you call home.

806
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,715
Your son has no claim to the throne.

807
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:23,988
- (Snorts)
- Liarl

808
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,872
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

809
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,751
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

810
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:33,317
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man. Do him no harm.

811
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,153
You think he stands alone?

812
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:43,271
Kill himl Kill all oftheml
I command itl

813
00:53:43,399 --> 00:53:47,278
Commanderl
Take the queen and her children into custody.

814
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,359
Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there, under guard.

815
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,197
Men of the Watchl

816
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:59,433
I want no bloodshed.

817
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:01,948
Tell your men to lay down their swords.

818
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,957
No one needs to die.

819
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:07,630
(Commander) Nowl

820
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,274
I did warn you not to trust me.
