357
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:45,915
I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners,
nowthat you're a lord.

358
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,751
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

363
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,788

-Had to be done.
-Yes, of course.

365
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,391

-Quite right.

I never said they were the Queen's orders.

to murder King Robert's bastards?

You've heard the awful rumours
about my brother and sister?

I don't listen to filth.

That's good of you, but you have heard them.

376
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:29,198
I suppose people who do believe that filth
consider Robert's bastards

377
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,669
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

381
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,033
in the throne room, did you give the order?

383
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,517
And I would again.

384
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,351
The man was a traitor.

385
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,192
He tried to buy my loyalty.

386
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,633

from my friend here.

to every man in jewellery,

529
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,712
Lord G reyjoy?

530
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,868
Have my things sent up to the castle.

531
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,712
You should give me the reins.

532
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,358
I'm a better rider than you.

533
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,272
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

534
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,793
Nine years?

535
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,559
Do you still know your way around a ship?

536
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,517
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

537
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,914
Don't you worry about my hands.

538
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,794
The sea is in my blood.

539
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,757
Your blood will be in the sea
ifl don't watch where I'm going.

540
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,194
l have a proposal for my father,

541
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:10,467
one that will make him king again,

542
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,117
and me after him.

543
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:17,118
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight ifyou're lucky.

544
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,237
Is that an offer from my future king?

545
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,356
An order from your future king.

546
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,353
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

547
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,670
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

548
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,315
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

549
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,109
THEON: Father.

550
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,078
BALON: Nine years, is it?

551
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,197
They took a frightened boy.

552
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,518
What have they given back?

553
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,348
Aman.

554
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,436
-Your blood and your heir.
-We shall see.

555
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,674
Stark had you longerthan I did.

556
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:04,350
Lord Stark is gone.

557
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:08,474
And how do you feel about that?

558
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,433
What's done is done.

559
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,392
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

560
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,913
Who gave you those clothes?

561
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:22,715
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

562
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,510
If my clothes offend you, I will change them.

563
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,669
You will.

564
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,354
That bauble round your neck,

565
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:33,476
did you paythe iron price for it, orthe gold?

566
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,232
| asked a question.

567
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,754
Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made

568
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:42,912
or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?

569
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,354
lron or gold?

570
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,395
Gold.

571
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,719
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

572
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,950
My fears have come true,

573
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,235
the Starks have made you theirs.

574
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,232
-My blood is salt and iron.
-Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

575
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,470
like atrained raven clutching his message.

576
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,318
The offer he makes is one I proposed.

577
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:16,913
-He heeds your counsel?
-|'ve lived with him,

578
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,472
hunted with him, fought at his side.

579
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,993
He thinks of me as a brother.

580
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,718
No, not here, not in my hearing.

581
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,995
You will not name him brother,

582
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,867
this son ofthe man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

583
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:31,632
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

584
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,550
I forget nothing.

585
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,391
I remember my brothers.

586
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,748
And | rememberwhen my fatherwas a king.

587
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,915
| see.

588
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,114
l destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

589
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,350
and he will make me
king ofthe lron lslands once again.

590
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:04,999
-I will lead the attack myself.
-Oh, you will?

591
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,627
I'm your son, your only living heir.

592
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,550
-Who else?
-(DOOR OPENS)

593
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:14,750
I told you to wait outside.

594
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,917
How did you get past the guards?

595
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,274
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

596
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,433
My dear.

597
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,395
Yara?

598
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,791
So good to see you, brother.

599
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,995
This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.

600
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,914
-She can't lead an attack!
-BALON: And why not?

601
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:40,868
You're awoman!

602
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,236
-You're the one in skirts.
-This isn't Winterfell, boy.

603
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:46,833
Your sistertook over command
of your eldest brother's ship

604
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:49,513
afteryour new father killed him.

605
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,433
-What's dead may never die.
-...dead may never die.

606
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,955
The only nights she's spent offthese islands
have been spent on the sea.

607
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,870
She's commanded men.

608
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:01,392
She's killed men.

609
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,991
She knows who she is.

610
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,869
No man gives me a crown.

611
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,590
lpaythe iron price.

612
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,910
I will take my crown,

613
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,509
forthat is who I am.

614
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,236
That is who we have always been.

615
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,109
You won't stand a chance
against the Lannisters on your own.

616
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,799
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

617
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,999
DAVOS: You'll have your gold
when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

618
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,798
SALLADHOR:
All these kings fighting for the throne,

619
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,599
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

620
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,988
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

621
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,952
Because you're a smart gambler.

622
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,558
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.

623
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,676
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

624
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,432
Neither has the false King Joffrey.

625
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,397
And yet they both have larger armies.

626
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,276
Stannis has just begun the fight.

627
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,158
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

628
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:07,952
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honourable than Stannis Baratheon

629
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,393
or more worthy of loyalty.

630
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,832
What is the world coming to

631
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,387
when smugglers must vouch
forthe honour of kings?

632
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,675
-Mind yourwords, pirate.
-Matthos.

633
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,398
You think I'm insulted?

634
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:20,232
lam a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

635
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,192
I don't sail for promises.

636
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,679
Of course you do.

637
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,627
Every time you leave harbour,
you're leaving on a promise,

638
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,429
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

639
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,988
-That's a promise that always comes true.
-As is mine.

640
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,311
You're not ayoung man, Salladhor.

641
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:38,709
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

642
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,828
Onlythe clever ones.

643
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,630
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

644
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,314
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.

645
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:50,436
They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.

646
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,592
What I'm offering you is hard.

647
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,399
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

648
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,994
You'll be the richest man in Lys,
and the most famous.

649
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,755
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

650
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:08,634
"Salladhor Saan" is a good name for songs.

651
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,995
-It is.
-One thing, lwant the queen.

652
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,839
-The queen?
-Cersei, lwant her.

653
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,308
l'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.

654
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,469
And ifwe don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

655
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,677
I will fuckthis blonde queen
and I'll fuck herwell.

656
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,478
MATTHOS: This war isn't about you.

657
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:28,118
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

658
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,555
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

659
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,268
As if she would just let you.

660
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:34,111
You don't know how persuasive I am.

661
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,512
I've never tried to fuck you.

662
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:41,238
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

663
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,719
the one true god...

664
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,239
I've been all over the world, my boy,

665
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,153
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true gods.

666
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,912
They all think they found the right one.

667
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,040
The one true god
is what's between a woman's legs,

668
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,548
and betteryet, a queen's legs.

669
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,189
lneverthought you'd have
atrue believer for a son.

670
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,474
He's young yet.

671
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,559
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

672
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,072
I cannot promise you the queen.

673
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,233
You believe your king can win?

674
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,472
He is the one true king.

675
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,279
You Westerosi are funny people.

676
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,432
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

677
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,709
l'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

678
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:24,438
You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.

679
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,435
Make me rich.

680
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,511
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

681
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,678
MATTHOS: When will the king have us sail?

682
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:45,715
As soon as his god wills it.

683
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,313
He's my god, too, and yours,

684
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:50,674
but you are too blind to see.

685
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,871
-Let me teach you how to read.
-Oh, you and your mother.

686
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,473
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

687
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,629
The holy books are
much more persuasive than I can be.

688
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:00,391
lwish I had a god, truly.

689
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,119
I'm not mocking you,
but I've seen men pray to every god there is,

690
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,394
pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.

691
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:08,039
-None of it works.
-But you always came home.

692
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,599
lwasn't praying.

693
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,238
But I was.

694
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:14,837
Every night that you were at sea,

695
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:17,638
I lit a candle and I prayed foryou.

696
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,473
You want me to have a god?

697
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,518
Fine. King Stannis is my god.

698
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,909
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

699
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:28,513
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

700
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,397
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

701
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,597
You think a fire god commanded all that?

702
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,796
It was Stannis, only Stannis.

703
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,709
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

704
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,473
Don't tell him that. (LAUGHS)

705
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:46,275
CERSEI: Lord Janos Slynt
was commander ofthe City Watch.

706
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,713
You had no right to exile him.

707
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,278
l have every right. I am the King's Hand.

708
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,999
You're serving as the King's Hand
till Father gets here.

709
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,308
lam Queen Regent.

710
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:54,957
Listen to me, Queen Regent.

711
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,439
You're losing the people.

712
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:59,315
-Do you hear me?
-(LAUGHS) The people.

713
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,078
You think I care?

714
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,834
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

715
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:09,552
Halfthe city will starve when winter comes.
The other halfwill plot to overthrow you.

716
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:13,029
And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry,

717
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,755
"The Queen slaughters babies."

718
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,753
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

719
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,996
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

720
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,518
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

721
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,799
Did he tell you?

722
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,632
I imagine that would be even worse.

723
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,996
He did what needed to be done.

724
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,992
You want to be Hand ofthe King?
You want to rule?

725
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,277
This is what ruling is,
lying on a bed of weeds,

726
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,112
ripping them out bythe root, one by one,

727
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,791
before they strangle you in your sleep.

728
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,189
I'm no king,
but I thinkthere's more to ruling than that.

729
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,793
I don't care what you think!

730
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,514
You've never taken it seriously.

731
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,237
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

732
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,672
It's all fallen on me.

733
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:14,469
As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

734
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:21,158
You're funny.

735
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,791
You've always been funny...

736
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,957
but none of yourjokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

737
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,237
You remember?

738
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,509
Back when you ripped my mother open
on yourway out of her

739
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,431
and she bled to death?

740
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,316
She was my mother, too.

741
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,913
Mother gone...

742
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:48,837
forthe sake of you.

743
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:54,312
There's no biggerjoke in the world than that.

744
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,839
(DOOR OPENS)

745
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,513
-Your Grace.
-Your Grace.

746
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,511
STANNlS: How did you fare with your pirate?

747
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,876
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.

748
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:25,790
His men know how to fight.

749
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,190
In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

750
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:30,678
It does seem the wiser choice.

751
00:44:30,759 --> 00:44:32,954
There won't be a choice this time.

752
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:35,268
Do you trust him?

753
00:44:35,919 --> 00:44:39,355
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I've known him 30 years.

754
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,236
l've nevertrusted him.

755
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,957
Now, once he gets the smell of gold
he never stops.

756
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:48,517
Well, if he does hisjob, he'll have his share.

757
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,069
Leave us.

758
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,508
At once, Your Grace.

759
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:10,437
The Lord of Light shines through you,
young warrior.

760
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:13,078
(WHISPERING)

761
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,029
Come.

762
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,474
What did you say to him?

763
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,392
ltold him death by fire is the purest death.

764
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,270
-Why?
-Because it is true.

765
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:34,558
You're troubled, my king.

766
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,629
Yeah.

767
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,194
These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.

768
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,159
Tell your lord to burn them, then.

769
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,638
ltell him nothing.

770
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,598
I pray for his commands and l obey.

771
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,189
My little brother has 100,000 men,
according to the scouts,

772
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:54,998
men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

773
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,798
You must have faith.

774
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,235
Faith?

775
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,399
In a real war, the side with
the greater numberwins,

776
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:04,037
nine times out often.

777
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,873
Then we must be the 10th.

778
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,913
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

779
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:13,475
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

780
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:18,395
l have seen the path to victory in the flames.

781
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,071
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

782
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,798
I've said the words, damn you.

783
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:31,469
I burned the idols.

784
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:37,989
You must give all of yourself.

785
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,114
l have a wife.

786
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,469
I took a vow.

787
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,471
She's sickly, weak...

788
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,272
Shut away in a tower.

789
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:59,470
She disgusts you.

790
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,392
And she's given you nothing,

791
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:09,075
no sons, only stillborns,

792
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:11,752
only death.

793
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,793
(WHlSPERlNG) I will give you a son, my king.

794
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:25,674
A son?
