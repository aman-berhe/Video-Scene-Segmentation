00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,319
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

180
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,716
We're digging trenches all along our flanks.

181
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,755
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

182
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,989
in a double envelopment.

183
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,559
A pincer move.

184
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,790
They won't be able to hit us from the sides.

185
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,548
Good.

186
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,953
lt's crucial that we let them charge at us.

187
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,507
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

188
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,317
lfwe let him buckle our centre, he'll pursue.

189
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,479
Then we'll have him surrounded
on three sides.

190
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,356
Did you reallythink
that cunt would fight you man-to-man?

191
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,428
No.

192
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,758
But I wanted to make him angry.

193
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,556
I want him coming at us full tilt.

194
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,038
We should all get some sleep.

195
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,757
TORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow.
We need you sharp tomorrow.

196
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,194
So, you've met the enemy,

197
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,032
drawn up your battle plans.

198
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,994
Aye, for what they're worth.

199
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,595
You've known him
for the space of a single conversation,

200
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,272
you and your trusted advisors,

201
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,557
and you sit around making your plans
on how to defeat a man you don't know.

202
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,279
I lived with him.

203
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,795
I know the way his mind works.
I know how he likes to hurt people.

204
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,998
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

205
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,554
You're right.

206
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,034
You think he's going to fall into your trap.
He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

207
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,953
-He's overconfident.
-He plays with people.

208
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,474
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

209
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,552
Aye, and what have I been doing all my life?
Playing with broomsticks?

210
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,996
I fought beyond the Wall
against worse than Ramsay Bolton.

211
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,593
l've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

212
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,069
You don't know him.

213
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,832
All right, tell me.

214
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:58,988
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

215
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,594
We'll never get him back.

216
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,958
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

217
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,828
which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

218
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,639
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

219
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,109
which means he won't live long.

220
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,477
We can't give up on our brother.

221
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,518
Listen to me, please.
He wants you to make a mistake.

222
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,588
Of course he does.

223
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,592
What should I do differently?

224
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,069
I don't know.
I don't know anything about battles.

225
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,918
Just don't do what he wants you to do.

226
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,319
Aye, that's good advice.

227
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:36,118
-You think that's obvious?
Well, it is a bit obvious.

228
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,349
lfyou had asked for my advice earlier,

229
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,032
I would have told you not to attack Winterfell

230
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,235
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

231
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,675
When will we have a larger force?

232
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,637
We've pleaded with every house
that'll have us.

233
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,870
The Blackfish can't help us.
We're lucky to have this many men.

234
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,269
-|t's not enough.
-No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

235
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,151
Battles have been won against greater odds.

236
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,711
lf Ramsay wins,
I'm not going backthere alive.

237
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,958
Do you understand me?

238
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,949
I won't ever let him touch you again.

239
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,070
l'll protect you, I promise.

240
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,151
No one can protect me.

241
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,391

DAVOS: You think there's hope?

244
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:51,067
TORMUND: I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

245
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:54,913
And they've never seen the free folk fight,
so, yes, there's hope.

246
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,078
You want to avenge your king, don't you?

247
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,674
It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.
It was Stannis himself.

248
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,475
I loved the man.
He lifted me up and made me something.

249
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,953
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

250
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,076
-You sawthese demons?
-What?

251
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,995
No, it's a manner of speaking.

252
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,790
Not actual demons.

253
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:24,828
Oh.

254
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:29,997
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis
and I loved the man he burned.

255
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,195
Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

256
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,352
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

257
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,918
I believed in him.

258
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,749
I thought he was the man
to lead us through the Long Night.

259
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,909
But I was wrong, just like you.

260
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,993
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

261
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,677
Jon Snow's not a king.

262
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,153
No, he's not.

263
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,995
I need a good drink
to help me sleep the night before a fight.

264
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,309
l have ajug of sour goat's milk

265
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:10,998
stronger than any of that grape water
you southern twats like sucking on.

266
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,835
No, thanks. It does sound delicious,
but I better keep a clear head.

267
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,716
I can never sleep the night before a battle.

268
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,515
So what do you do all night?

269
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,508
I walk. Think and walk.

270
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,791

until I'm far enough away from camp

My lady.

275
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,872
You weren't at the war council.

276
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,198
I'm not a soldier.

277
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,879
Any advice?

278
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,514
Don't lose.

279
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,550
IfI do, ifI fall...

280
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,599
Don't bring me back.

281
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,673
I'll have to try.

282
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,477
I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

283
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,993
lam not your servant, Jon Snow.

284
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,354
You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

285
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,078
I serve the Lord of Light.

286
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,350
I do what he commands.

287
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,668
How do you know what he commands?

288
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,236
l interpret his signs

289
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,352
as well as I can.

290
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,634
lfthe Lord didn't want me to bring you back,
how did I bring you back?

00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,632
l have no power.

292
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,512
Only what he gives me, and he gave me you.

294
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,999
I don't know.

295
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,237
Maybe you're only needed for
this small part of his plan and nothing else.

296
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,714
Maybe he brought you here to die again.

297
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,875
What kind of god
would do something like that?

298
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,838

was at Winterfell, yes?

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,398
You were making jokes about my height,
I seem to recall.

304

Everyone who makes ajoke
about a dwarf's height

305
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,036
thinks he's the only person
ever to make ajoke about a dwarf's height.

"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

"someone to look up to."

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,671
You're all making the same five or sixjokes.

-It was a long time ago.
-It was.

310
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,713
And how have things
been going foryou since then?

311
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,991
Not so well, I gather.

312
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:39,556
Can't imagine you would have murdered
the Stark boys ifthings had been going well.

313
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,153
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

314

But I did things
that were just as bad or worse.

315
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,355
And he paid forthem.

316
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,713
Doesn't seem like it.

He's still alive.

You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them.

322
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:08,269
In return, I expect you want me to support
your claim to the throne ofthe lron lslands?

323
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,111
Not my claim. Hers.

There are, and Euron is building more.

339

He's going to offer them to you.

340
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:57,958
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

341
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,394
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

342
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,598
He also wants to give you...

00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,513
His big cock, I think he said.

344
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,512
Euron's offer is also
an offer of marriage, you see.

345
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,317
You won't get one without the other.

346
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,868
And I imagine your offer
is free of any marriage demands?

347
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,874
I never demand,
but I'm up for anything, really.
