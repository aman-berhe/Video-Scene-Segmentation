00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,393
He sent me to treat with you in good faith
as your fellow ironborn.

185
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,118
And what does Lord Bolton want?

186
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,156
You are fading from sickness,

187
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:03,515
you are badly outnumbered,
and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.

188
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,716
Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men

189
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,348
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

190
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:14,149
Do this, and he will bejust and fairwith you
as he has been with me.

191
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,156
The Boltons will give you
safe passage to the Stony Shore.

192
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,470
He wants us to surrender?

193
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,437
My own father, your king,

194
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,272
surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.

195
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,634
lwatched him bend the knee.

196
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,789
There was no shame there.

197
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,753
He fought with honour, as did you.

198
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,430
(GROANS)

199
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,634
(MUTTERING) "No shame."
"Fought with honour."

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,153
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

201
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,548
(SPITS)

202
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,478
"No shame." "Fought with honour."

203
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,870
Only a whipped dog would speak this way.

204
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,433
Or awoman.

205
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,914
(WHIMPERING)

206
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,149
Are you a woman, boy?

207
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,549
You don't know...

208
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,470
The ironborn will not surrender.

209
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,277
(MUMBLING) My name is Reek...

210
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:08,477
You go tell your masterthat, Theon Greyjoy,

211
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,470
or whoever the fuck you are.

212
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,197
(QUIETLY) Reek.

213
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,510
-What in the hell are you muttering?
-Reek.

214
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,273
Reek.

215
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,751
lfwe yield, we live?

216
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,400
-Is that what it says on this paper here?
-Yes.

217
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,990
Have your men raise the white flag
and open the gates.

218
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,915
You're going home.

219
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,949
RAMSAY: You didn't reallythink
I'd let them go, did you?

220
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,676
lt's fallen out of fashion, flaying.

221
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,715
Sad, but true.

222
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,710
Traditions are important.

223
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,554
Where are we without our history? Eh?

224
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,632
Yes, my lord.

225
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,391
Will we go home now?

226
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,871
I believe we will.

227
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,791
To our new home.

228
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,876
A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes.

229
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,433
I suppose all of our ancestors
came from somewhere else originally.

230
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,909
ROYCE: Our forebears settled the Vale
thousands of years ago.

231
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,876
We've fought off invaders ever since.

232
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:34,350
The beauty ofthe Vale is matched
only by the nobility of its great families.

233
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,513
Lady Arryn often told me that
you were her rock, Lord Royce.

234
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,591
She told me nothing about you, Baelish.

235
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,954
But I didn't need to hear from her.

236
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,758
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

237
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,797
You've been licking
Tywin Lannister's boots so long,

238
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:50,597
-it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
-My lord...

239
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,718
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

240
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,951
Always been a grubbyjob.
Why not let a grubby man do it?

241
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,040
But when I heard you were lurking here,

242
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,556
-fawning over the Lady Arryn...
-Lady Arryn invited me.

243
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,149
She and l have been close since childhood.

244
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,707
Yes, we all know how close you were.

245
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,434
Lady Arryn's predilections
were her own affair.

246
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:14,077
Her death is our affair.

247
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,832
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

248
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,717
She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.

249
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,915
But suicide?

250
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,078
She adored that boy of hers.

251
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,549
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

252
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,632
ROYCE: Strange that within days
of your arrival,

253
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,596
you've married Lady Arryn

254
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,750
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

255
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,512
She was always prone to melancholy.

256
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,472
My lady wasn't meant for a world
as brutal as ours.

257
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,232
We were told there was a witness. A girl.

258
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,271
A niece of yours, I believe.

259
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,748
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.

260
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,033
I assure you, she would be of no help.

261
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,871
We'd like to speak with her.

262
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,754
-Let me fetch her.
-ANYA: No need.

263
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,558
We preferto
hear her testimony unadulterated.

00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:09,868
(DOOR CLOSES)

265
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:11,597
Come closer, child.

266
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,389
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

267
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:19,108
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?

268
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,349
Your name is Alayne?

269
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,510
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if Lord Baelish left the room.

270
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,952
-My lady...
-I wasn't asking you.

271
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,028
He can stay.

272
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,950
Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

273
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,028
Tell us what you saw.

274
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,394
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

275
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,912
l have to tell the truth.

276
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,870
I'll tell you everything.

277
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:49,634
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

278
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,518
My name is not Alayne.

279
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,873
lt's Sansa Stark,

280
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,754
eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.

281
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,311
Lord Royce,
we met when you came to Winterfell.

282
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,871
You were escorting your son Ser Waymar
to the Wall.

283
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,677
Sansa Stark?

284
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,751
You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?

285
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,592
Lord Baelish has told many lies.

286
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:18,235
All to protect me.

287
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,397
Since my father was executed,

288
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,357
l have been a hostage in King's Landing.

289
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,555
A plaything for Joffrey to torture
or Queen Cersei to torment.

290
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,720
They beat me, they humiliated me,

291
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,869
they married me to the lmp.

292
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,916
I had no friends in King's Landing,

293
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,998
except one.

294
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,159
He saved me.

295
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:52,356
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

296
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,548
He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie
with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.

297
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,791
But the Lannisters have friends everywhere.

298
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,153
Even the Vale.

299
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,550
He made me swear
not to tell anyone my true name.

300
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:09,277
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

301
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:12,312
ROYCE: Your father grew up
right here in these halls.

302
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,391
We hunted together many times.

303
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,912
He was a fine man.

304
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:19,718
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

305
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,875
You knew herwell, my lords, my lady.

306
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,517
She was a troubled woman.

307
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,271
She always loved Lord Baelish.
She told me herself.

308
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,398
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

309
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:38,028
a boy of eight
carrying everything he owned in a little sack.

310
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,118
She confessed to me
she never loved Lord Arryn.

311
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,431
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

312
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,431
When the gods finally allowed her
to be with Lord Baelish,

313
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,272
she was so happy. For a time.

314
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,676
My aunt was ajealous lady.

315
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,270
She was terrified that
Lord Baelish didn't love her any more.

316
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,112
That he would abandon her
for ayoungerwoman.

317
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:11,310
And then,

318
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,277
one day she saw him kiss me.

319
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:15,514
Lady Sansa.

320
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,909
It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce,
nothing more.

321
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:23,188
Lord Baelish is my uncle now, by marriage.

322
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,390
He's always been so kind to me.

323
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,357
l was so happy to be here, to be free.

324
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:29,474
All because of him.

325
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,436
But my aunt turned on me.

326
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,477
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

327
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,632
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

328
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:42,553
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her,
she struck him.

329
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:43,788
She said she didn't want to live any more.

330
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,871
She stood on the edge ofthat Moon Door.

331
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,711
He tried to reason with her,

332
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,110
promised her
she was the only one he had ever loved,

333
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,590
but she stepped through those doors
and she was...

334
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,788
(SHUSHING)

335
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,474
It's not your fault, sweet girl.

336
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,115
It's not your fault.

337
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,829
ROYCE: You could see it in the way
she raised that boy.

338
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,718
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

339
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,632
ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardlythe time.

340
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,596
Apologies, my lady.

341
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,831
And to you as well, Baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.

342
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,549
You wantjustice, Lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.

343
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:42,754
lwant the same.

344
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,310

meted out in suicide, is there?

00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:49,594
LlTTLEFlNGER: For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

346
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,751
Only 20 years ago, the knights ofthe Vale

347
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,115
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

348
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,431
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

349
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,677
And since then, Arryn and Royce,
Corbray, Waynwood,

350
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,752
all the great houses ofthe Vale
watched from the corner.

Atimid boy at atavern brawl.

Are you questioning our courage?

353
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,189
I want to know which side you're on.

354
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,032
Do you support the Lannisters, the house
that executed your friend Ned Stark?

355
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,714
Of course we don't support
the damn Lannisters.

356
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,792
No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
for support, and Lysa refused.

357
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,833
By staying out ofthe fray,

358
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,832
you've allowed Tywin Lannister
to destroy his rivals on every compass point.

359
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,273
Who stands against him now?

360
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,827
Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?

361
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,591
Robb Stark is dead.

362
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,035
I'd have you back Robin Arryn,

363
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,439
Lord ofthe Vale.

364
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,670
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

365
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:41,910
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

366
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,911
More often they die young.

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,434
I adored Lysa with all my heart,

368
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,432
but she loved her son so much
she became overprotective.

369
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,034
He needs to learn how to swing a sword,
how to ride a horse.

370
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,395
-Aye, it's time.
-Yes.

371
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:01,392
Time for him to tourthe Vale,
to visit all the castles in his domain.

372
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:04,596
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

373
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,317
(GRUNTING)

374
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,911
BOY: Ser Barristan.

375
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,712
Yes?

376
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,914
Who sent you?

377
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:06,390
-Ser Barristan.
-Ser Jorah.

378
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,112
Have I forgotten a council meeting?

379
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,634
No.

380
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,398
What's this?

381
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,471
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.

382
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,437
You spied on her.

383
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,989
Who gave you this?

384
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,954
Does it matter?

385
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,517
-Have you told her?
-I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man,

386
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,635
rather than go behind your back.

387
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,352
Let me speak with her in private.

388
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,510
You'll never be alone with her again.

389
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,074
Why did the usurper pardon you?

390
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,559
lfwe could speak alone.

391
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,598
No, speak to me here.

392
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,476
Explain it to me.

393
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,518
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?
Who profits?

394
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,470
He wants to divide us.

395
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,868
lfwe're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

396
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,678
The pardon was signed the year we met.

397
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:11,673
Why were you pardoned?

398
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,955
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

399
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,268
It is not forged.

400
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:20,231
Why, then?

401
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,912
I sent letters to Varys,

402
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,752
the spymaster of King's Landing.

403
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,431
What was the content ofthese letters?

404
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,831
-|nformation.
-What information?

405
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,317
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.

406
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,117
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.

407
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,230
When you were married.

408
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,072
When your brother died.

409
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,356
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

410
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,153
-|...
-Yes or no?

411
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,274
-Khaleesi.
-Don't call me that.

412
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,271
Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?

413
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,309
Yes.

414
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,590
That wine merchant tried to poison me
because of your information.

415
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,272
I stopped you from drinking his wine.

416
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,350
Because you knew it was poisoned.

417
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,435
I suspected.

418
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,158
You betrayed me

419
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,956
from the first.

420
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,758
Forgive me.

421
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,067
I never meant...

422
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,759
Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

423
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,751
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

424
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,830
-and stole my brother's throne...
-l have protected you,

425
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,354
-fought foryou, killed foryou.
-...and you want me to forgive you?

426
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,359
l have loved you.

427
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,032
Love?

428
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,149
Love? How can you say that to me?

429
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,988
Any other man,
and I would have you executed.

430
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,037
But you,
I do not want you in my city dead or alive.

431
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,031
Go back to your masters in King's Landing.
Collect your pardon, ifyou can.

432
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,189
Daenerys, please.

433
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,910
Don't ever presume to touch me again
or speak my name.

434
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,752
You have until duskto collect yourthings
and leave this city.

435
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,071
lfyou're found in Meereen past break of day,

436
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,469
I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay.

437
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,919
Go.

438
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,833
Now.

439
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,914
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)

440
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,673
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

441
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,077
Walk with me.

442
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,469
Has there been any word from Locke?

443
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,959
No.

444
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,715
Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy.

445
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:21,547
None ofthe northern lords have seen them.

446
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,195
Dead most likely.

447
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,917
Most ofthe ironborn have fled the North.

448
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:32,674
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

449
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,797
Tell me what you see.

450
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,393
Moors, fields, hills.

451
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,067
Tell me what you see.

452
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,431
Nothing.

453
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,317
Not nothing. The North.

454
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,191
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

455
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,636
400 miles that way.

456
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,759
300 miles that way.

457
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,510
The North is largerthan
the other six kingdoms combined.

458
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,874
And I am the Warden ofthe North.

459
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:12,029
The North is mine.

460
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,790
Now tell me, what is your name?

461
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,352
Ramsay Snow.

462
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,636
No, not Ramsay Snow.

463
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,193
Open it.

464
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,435
From this day until your last day,

465
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,430
you are Ramsay Bolton,

466
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,273
son of Roose Bolton, Warden ofthe North.

468
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,913
You honour me.

469
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:45,956
I swear I will uphold your name
and yourtradition.

470
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,073
I will be worthy of you, Father,

471
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,877
I promise.

472
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:12,711

474
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,474
Yes?

(DOOR CLOSES)

476
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,229
First time I saw you, you were just a child.

477
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,198
A girl from the North
come to the capital for the first time.

478
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,755
You're not a child any longer.

479
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,794
Why did you help me?

480
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,953
They would have thrown you through
the Moon Door ifthey found you guilty.

481
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,315
That's not an answer.

482
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,432
lfthey'd have executed you,
what would they have done with me?

483
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,830
I don't know.

484
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,718
Neither do |.

485
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,797
Better to gamble on the man you know
than the strangers you don't?

486
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:35,559
And you think you know me?

487
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,751
-I know what you want.
-Do you?

ARYA: I thought it'd make me happy,

489
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,677
but it doesn't. Not really.

00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,112
-ARYA: Lots ofthings make me happy.
-Like what?

492
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,791
ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

493
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,316
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself,

494
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,388
is that it?

495
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,071
ARYA: At least I could have
been there to watch.

496
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,719
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

497
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:16,030
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

498
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:20,588
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?

499
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,398
I wasn't the damn wine-taster.

500
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:29,595
Little shit deserved to die, but poison...

501
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,397
Poison's a woman's weapon.

502

Men kill with steel.

503
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,359
That's your stupid pride talking.
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

504
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:40,158
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone
ifl had to.

(LAUGHS)

506

591
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:16,151

to unravel the mysteries

600
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:37,273

00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:46,355
Doesn't seem right.

605
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:50,114
In any case, I found nothing that
illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction

orthe reason behind
his relentless beetle slaughter.

607
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,350

I may not have been able to speak with Orson,

609
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:59,873
but I could observe him, watch him

610
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,996

oftheir behaviour.

612
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:09,197
And as I watched,

613
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,669
I became more and more sure of it.

614
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:13,909
There was something happening there.

615
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,834
His face was like the page of a book

00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:21,592
But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.

618
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,759
And I became possessed
with knowing what they were.

619
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,400
