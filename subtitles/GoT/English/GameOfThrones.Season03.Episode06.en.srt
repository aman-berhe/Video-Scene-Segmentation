told the children to make them behave.

00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,113
This isn't happening to you for a reason.

362
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,270
But, well, one reason...

363
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,749
I enjoy it.

364
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,877
THEON: Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!

365
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,597
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

366
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,428
lwin.

367
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,030
ROBB: Thank you for riding here so quickly.

368
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,430
I know travel isn't easy in these times.

369
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,080
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

370
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,833
When the King of
the North summons us, we come.

371
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,477
LOTHAR: Our father
has instructed us to tell you that his alliance

372
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,235
with the North can continue
if his terms are met.

373
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,077
Lord Frey requires a formal apology

374
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,110
for your violation of your sacred oath
to marry one of his daughters.

375
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,959
Of course.
He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.

376
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,429
As restitution for this betrayal,

377
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,512
he demands Harrenhal
and all its attendant lands.

378
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,873
I don't thinkthat's...

379
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,274
We are fighting for the North.

380
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,796
Harrenhal is not in the North.

381
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:16,153
It is his once the war is over and we have no
further strategic need for it.

382
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:19,631
And there's something else.

383
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,991
We will do whatever
we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.

384
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,355
Not what, whom.

385
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:29,628
What?

386
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,228
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

387
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,389
Uh, no.

388
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:41,314
Our father requires Lord Edmure to
wed one of his daughters. Roslin.

389
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,389
How old is she?

390
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,555
Nineteen.

391
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:44,867
Could I see her first?

392
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,228
You want to count her teeth?

393
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,830
We depart for the Twins in the morning.

394
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,790
We need an answer before we leave,

395
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,471
and awedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

396
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,118
or this alliance is at an end.

397
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:56,947
Your father does
realise we're in the middle of a war?

398
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,312
Father is old.

399
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,953
It will put his heart at peace if he could see
her wed to a good husband.

400
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:08,427
And his recent experience
has made him wary of long engagements.

401
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,679
He has every right to be.

402
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,750
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

403
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,472
(DOOR OPENING)

404
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,237
Why should I let
that old ferret choose my bride for me?

405
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,073
At the very least,
I should be offered the same choice you were.

406
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:37,638
l'm his liege lord.

407
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:39,789
ROBB: He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

408
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:43,076
EDMURE:
I didn't wound him. My answer is no.

409
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,716
Listen to me and listen very carefully. You...

410
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,268
The laws of gods and men are very clear.

411
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,868
No man can compel another man to marry.

412
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:59,109
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

413
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,555
It's all right. You heard him.

414
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,319
lfyou refuse,
our alliance with the Freys is dead.

415
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,991
He's wanted me for
one of his daughters since I was 12.

416
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,797
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

417
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,711
When I say no, he will come back

418
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,716
and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

419
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,392
You're willing to risk our freedom

420
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,111
and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?

421
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,671
l have a war to fight.

422
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:25,073
We can't win it without them.
I have no time to haggle.

423
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,191
You said you wanted
to make amends for the Stone Mill.

424
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,672
You recall that heroic engagement?

425
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,352
I had something less permanent in mind.

426
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,435
I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war.

427
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,275
lfwe don't do this and do it now, we're lost.

428
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,989
l'll marry her.

429
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,197
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right.

430
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,473
l'll remember it.

431
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,075
BOLTON: | see my men have finally found
you something appropriate to wear.

432
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,276
BRIENNE: Yes. Most kind ofthem.

433
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,871
You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.

434
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:21,189
lam acting on Lady Stark's orders

435
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,550
to return Jaime Lannisterto King's Landing.

436
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,076
When King Robb left
Harrenhal, his motherwas his prisoner.

437
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,435
If she wasn't his mother,
he'd have hanged her fortreason.

438
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,629
I should send you back to Robb Stark.

439
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,831
You should.

440
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,959
But instead,
you're sitting here, watching me fail at dinner.

441
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,790
Why might that be?

442
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,668
Wars cost money.
Many people would pay a great deal for you.

443
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:55,034
We both know who would pay the most.

444
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,717
Or make you pay the most
if he found out you had captured me

445
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,950
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

446
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,519
You're right.

447
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:07,949
Perhaps the safest thing
to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.

448
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,507
JAIME: It would be,

449
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,952
ifyou honestly believed
my fatherwould never find out about it.

450
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,156
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.

451
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,470
He doesn't have time for anything else.

452
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:19,278
He'll make time foryou.

453
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,235
As soon as you're well enough to travel,

454
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,315
I will allow you to go to King's Landing

455
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,710
as restitution
for the mistakes my soldiers made.

456
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:33,957
And you will swear to
tell your father the truth,

457
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,429
that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

458
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,275
Shall we drink on it?

459
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,555
I don't partake.

460
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,869
You do understand
how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

461
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,832
Very well.

462
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:59,553
My lady, may ourjourney
continue without further incident.

463
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:00,992
Oh, she won't be going with you.

464
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,635
lam charged with bringing Ser Jaime to...

465
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:06,108
BOLTON: You are charged
with abetting treason.

466
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,475
I'm afraid I must insist.

467
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,915
You're in no place to insist on anything.

468
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,868
I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson

469
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,474
about overplaying your position.

470
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,317
-OLENNA: Impossible.
-Why?

471
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,111
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.

472
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,951
The most desirable bachelor
in all seven kingdoms.

473
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,391
-Your daughter...
-|s rich,

474
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:33,710
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms,

475
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,998
and the mother ofthe King.

476
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,228
Old.

477
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,313
Old?

478
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,467
Old.

479
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,394
l'm something of an expert on the subject.

480
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,869
Her change will be upon her before long.

481
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:51,349
l'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

482
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,908
You may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

483
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:56,035
but this is another matter entirely.

484
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:59,630
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

485
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,868
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

486
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,834
The only thing that might turn it are details

487
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,393
of your grandson's nocturnal activities.

488
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,475
Do you denythem?

489
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,595
Oh, not at all.

490
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,477
A sword-swallower through and through.

491
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,990
A boy with his affliction
should be grateful for the opportunity

492
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,593
to marry
the most beautiful woman in the Kingdoms

493
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,036
and remove the stain from his name.

494
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,027
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

495
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,748
Sons of your
father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?

496
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,598
Of course.

497
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:36,951
And you never...

498
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:39,114
No.

499
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,513
Not once? Not in any way?

500
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:44,558
Never.

501
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,191
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

502
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,316
But it's natural,
boys having a go beneath the sheets.

503
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:55,509
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance for unnatural behaviour.

504
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,873
lwouldn't saythat.

505
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:59,434
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots

506
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,869
over a discreet bit of buggery, but

507
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,630
brothers and sisters...

508
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,512
Where I come from,
that stain would be very difficult to wash out.

509
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,035
I will not breathe further life

510
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,275
into a malicious lie by discussing it.

511
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,798
Lie or not,

512
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,997
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

513
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,310
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

514
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,516
and send them off
to kill Lannisters and Tyrells,

515
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,238
thanks to our new affiliation.

516
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,271
I don't care what people believe.

517
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,068
And neither do you.

518
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,427
(CHUCKLES)

519
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,513
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

520
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,993
Now, ifthe rumours about
my children were true,

521
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:44,835
then Joffrey is no king at all,

522
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,750
and House Tyrell
is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.

523
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,433
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children,

524
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,198
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

525
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,874
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

526
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,755
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?

527
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,147
All right.

528
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,474
l'll remove it foryou.

529
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,273
lfyou refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,

530
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:14,072
lwill name him to the Kingsguard.

531
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,268
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.

532
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,074
He will never marry.
He will never have children.

533
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:21,714
Ah.

You would have your grandson protected
by someone who disgusts you?

537
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,829
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

538

who takes his vows seriously.

539
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,394
So, shall I draw up the order?

540

Or do you consent to this match?

541
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,631

a man who lives up to his reputation.

Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?

581
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,310
No. I had never left Winterfell

582
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,270
before I came to King's Landing.

583
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:36,277
But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it.

584
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,158
And to leave this place.

585
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,033
lt's terrible, isn't it?

586
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,795

588

We can have them both killed.

589
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,911
It's hard to say which ofthe four of us

590
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,791
is getting the worst ofthis arrangement.

591
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,630
Probably Sansa.

592
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,270
Though Loras will certainly come to
know a deep and singular misery.

593
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,237
Father doesn't discriminate.

594
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:19,877
We're all being shipped offto hell together.

595
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,678
On a boat you built.

596
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,511
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

597
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,989
I did what I did to protect our family.

598
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,433
I'm your family.

599
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,310
A member of your family who has actively

600
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:34,714
contributed to that family's survival.

601
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,028
Whether or not you
or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.

602
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,834
I do admit it.

603
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,508
If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,

604
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,477
Stannis would
have sacked the city before Father got here.

605
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:50,634
Our heads would still be
rotting on the city gate.

606
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,632
Trying to have me killed
is an odd way of saying thank you.

607
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,910
There are two people in King's Landing

608
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,996
who can give an order to a Kingsguard.

609
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,674
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon

610
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,473
to kill me during the Battle ofthe Blackwater?

611
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,957
The impulse I understand.

612
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,034
He hates me because I'm the only one

613
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,713
who tells him what he really is.

614
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:33,957
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead. But his stupidity?

615
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,791
He could have had me
poisoned and no one would have known.

616
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,156
But the King orders a Kingsguard

617
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:44,868
to murderthe Hand
ofthe King in full view of his own army.

618
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:46,358
The boy's an idiot.

619
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,872
What do you want me to say?

620
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,632
lwant you to tell me
if my life is still in danger.

621
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,198
Probably.

622
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,111
But not from Joffrey.
He won't do anything now Father's here.

623
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,873
Seven kingdoms united in fear
of Tywin Lannister.

624
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:04,038
Not the Tyrells.

625
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:06,790
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

626
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,190
Joffrey will
belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore,

627
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,953
and so will his children and their children.

628
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,950
History will be taken from our hands.

629
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,992
You may escape, at least.

630
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:21,118
Once Jaime gets back,

631
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,112
Ser Loras may come down with a terrible
case of sword through bowels.

632
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,671
When Jaime gets back, yes.

633
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,718
But when will that be?
He's out there somewhere.

634
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,355
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

635
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:42,350
Who's going to tell her?

636
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,792
Do you think people will like it?

637
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,716
SHAE: I don't thinkthey will even notice it.

638
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,550
You're right. It's not my wedding.

639
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,548
Anyway, from what I can tell,

640
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,436
the dressmakers in Highgarden will be

641
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,357
far superiorto the ones in King's Landing.

642
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:00,437
They'd never make me
anything as dull as this for my wedding.

643
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:04,312
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

644
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:06,117
I'm sure he does.

645
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:09,436
Will they let me invite my family?

646
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,711
They haven't asked my opinion.

647
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,552
But do you think they will?

648
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,632
No.

649
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,395
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.

650
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,555
Should I...

651
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:26,516
I beg your pardon, my lady.

652
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:30,756
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
l was trying on a gown for Joffrey's wedding.

653
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,116
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

654
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,707
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

655
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:40,834
Of course.

656
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,359
Alone, ifl may.

657
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,078
Why do you need to speak to her alone?

658
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,878
Shae.

659
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,711
Please excuse her. She's not from here.

660
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,309
But I trust her,
even though she tells me not to.

661
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:58,789
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something,

662
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,628
and it's only afterwards, when it's too late,

663
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,789
that we realise we wished we'd heard it

664
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,029
under entirely different circumstances.

665
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,908
It's all right, really.

666
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,996
How to begin?

The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:52,472
Shame you had to settle
foryour second choice.

681
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,515
Early days, my friend.

682
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,909
It is flattering, really,

683
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,635
you feeling such dread
at the prospect of me getting what I want.

684
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,837
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition, I promise you.

685
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,678
Although who doesn't like to see

686
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,358
their friends fail now and then?

687
00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:12,713
You're so right.

688
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,554
For instance, when l thwarted your plan

689
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,193
to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.

690
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,078
If I'm going to be honest,

691
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,596
I did feel an unmistakable
sense of enjoyment there.

692
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,069
But your confidant,

693
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,515
the one who fed
you information about my plans,

694
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,034
the one you swore to protect...

695
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,430
You didn't bring her any enjoyment.

696
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,836
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

697
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,074
She was a bad investment on my part.

698
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:52,193
Luckily, I have a friend
who wanted to try something new.

699
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,718
Something daring.

700
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:02,309
And he was so grateful
to me for providing this fresh experience.

701
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,028
I did what I did forthe good ofthe realm.

702
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,879
The realm?

703
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:13,755
Do you know what the realm is?

704
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,751
It's the 1,000 blades of Aegon's enemies.

705
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,755
A story we agree
to tell each other over and over,

706
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,796
till we forget that it's a lie.

707
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,357
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

708
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:34,671
Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

709
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,274
Chaos isn't a pit.

710
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,316
Chaos is a ladder.

711
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,155
Many who try to climb it fail
and never get to try again.

712
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,555
The fall breaks them.

713
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,313
And some are given
a chance to climb, but they refuse.

714
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,833
They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.

lllusions.

716
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,836
Onlythe ladder is real.

717
00:47:18,439 --> 00:47:21,590
The climb is all there is.
