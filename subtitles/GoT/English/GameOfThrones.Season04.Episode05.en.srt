00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,874
HIGH SEPTON:
May the Warrior grant him courage

2
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,792
and protect him in these perilous times.

3
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,916
May the Smith grant him strength

4
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,230
that he might bear this heavy burden.

5
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,958
And maythe Crone,

6
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,634
she that knows the fate of all men,

7
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,835
show him the path he must walk

8
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,629
and guide him through the dark places
that lie ahead.

9
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,868
In the light ofthe Seven,

10
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,917
| now proclaim Tommen
ofthe House Baratheon,

11
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,478
First of His Name,

12
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,754
King ofthe Andals and the First Men

13
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
and Lord ofthe Seven Kingdoms.

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,272
Long may he reign!

15
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,111
ALL: Long may he reign!

16
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,670
(CHEERING)

17
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,956
Special day.

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,435
(CROWD CHATTING)

19
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,317
Your Grace.

20
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,917
Your Grace.

21
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,031
CROWD: Your Grace.

22
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,591
Your Grace.

23
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,318
There he is.

24
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,913
Long may he reign.

25
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,398
Long may he reign.

26
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,919
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,072
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

28
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,469
No, he wasn't.

29
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,470
You still mourn for Joffrey?

30
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,391
He was my husband. My king.

31
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,514
He would have been your nightmare.

32
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,355
Your Grace, | feel...

33
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,271
You knew exactly what he was.

34
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,309
I did, too.

35
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,829
You never love anything in the world
the way you love your first child.

36
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,790
Doesn't matter what they do.

37
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,919
And what he did, it shocked me.

38
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,356
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

39
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,589
No.

40
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,877
The things he did shocked me.

41
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,071
He's only a boy.

42
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,237
A good, decent boy. He always has been.

43
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,471
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,792
He could be the first man who sits on
that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.

45
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,391
It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

46
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,629
For all the horrorthat put him there.

47
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:25,108
He will need help

48
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,991
if he's going to rule well.

49
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,990
He has you.

50
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,273
A mother is not enough.

51
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,799
You're still interested in being queen?

52
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,188
(SCOFFS)

53
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,478
After all that's happened?

54
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,557
It sounds strange, but I am...

55
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,558
I haven't even given any thought to it,
what comes next.

56
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,472
It would be a great honour, of course.

57
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,952
But I will have to speak to my father about it.

58
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,793
Yes, speak to your father.

59
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,791
l'll speak to mine.

60
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,317
We may be faced with an alarming number
of weddings soon.

61
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,868
-(CHUCKLES)
-I won't even know what to call you.

62
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,598
Sister?

63
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,515
Or Mother?

64
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,228
(CHUCKLES)

65
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,270
JORAH: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

66
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,878
Murdered at his own wedding.

67
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,032
BARRISTAN: And we've taken
the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.

68
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,076
The Second Sons took the navy.

69
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,036
Who told you to?

70
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,108
No one.

71
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,472
So why did you do it?

72
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,556
I heard you liked ships.

73
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,919
How many ships?

74
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,273
93, Your Grace.

75
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,759
How many men can they carry?

76
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,229
9,300, not counting sailors.

77
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,071
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

78
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,197
The Lannisters have more.

79
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,349
BARRISTAN: They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.

80
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,237
They're tired, dispersed.

81
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,315
And nowtheir king is dead.

82
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,198
8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons

83
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,471
sailing into Blackwater Bay

84
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,028
and storming the gates without warning.

85
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,434
It's hard to say. It could be enough.

86
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,672
But we're not fighting to make you
queen of King's Landing.

87
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,638
10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

88
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,311
BARRISTAN: The old houses
will flock to our queen

89
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,833
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

90
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,479
JORAH: The old houses will flock to
whichever side theythink will win,

91
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,471
as they always have.

92
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,869
There's other news.

93
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,712
From Yunkai.

94
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,598
Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule,

95
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,989
the Wise Masters have
retaken control ofthe city.

96
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,354
They've reenslaved the freedmen
who stayed behind

97
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,714
and sworn to take revenge against you.

98
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,836
And in Astapor,

99
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,429
the council you installed to rule over the city

100
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,478
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,552
who's declared himself
"His lmperial Majesty."

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,392
DAENERYS: Please leave me.

103
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,311
Not you, Jorah.

104
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,512
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay
isn't going quite as planned.

105
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,353
You could sail for Westeros
and leave it all behind.

106
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,236
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

107
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,233
A boy many believe to be
a bastard with no right to it.

108
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,549
They've never been more vulnerable.

109
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,279
You counselled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

110
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,798
I didn't listen.

111
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,748
That all worked out well.

112
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,790
(CHUCKLES)

113
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,189
How can I rule seven kingdoms

114
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,836
ifl can't control Slaver's Bay?

115
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,593
Why should anyone trust me,

116
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,156
follow me?

117
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,638
You're a Targaryen,

118
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,836
the Mother of Dragons.

119
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,710
I need to be more than that.

120
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,837
lwill not let those I have freed
slide back into chains.

121
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,436
I will not sail for Westeros.

122
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,351
What, then?

123
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,870
I will do what queens do.

124
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,315
lwill rule.

125
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,032
Pull up yourhood.

126
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,076
A memorable shade.

127
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,037
But how would they know?

128
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,634
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoythe most?

129
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,314
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

130
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,789
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?

131
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,995
The mountains are impassable.

132
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,196
lfyou want to get to the Eyrie,
you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

133
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,595
It doesn't matter how large your army is,

134
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,352
ifyou attack this gate, you do it on this road,

135
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,236
three men abreast,

136
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,709
and get slaughtered like goats.

137
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,557
The first Lords ofthe Vale didn't have much,

138
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,314
but they had these mountains
and they knew how to use them.

139
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,071
And the fortress they built here
has never been overcome.

140
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,879
Not once in 1,000 years.

141
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,559
Know your strengths, use them wisely,

142
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,598
and one man can be worth 10,000.

143
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,917
KNIGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

144
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,797
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

145
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,594
Stand to.

146
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,874
KNIGHTS: Stand to!

147
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,715
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

148
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,915

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,751
Uncle Petyr!

LITTLEFINGER: My lord.

152
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,632
Oh.

153
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,113
l have brought you a gift.

154
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,679
Lord Baelish.

155
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,227
-My lady.
-Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

156
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,787
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

157
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,393
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Lady Arryn.

158
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,709
-My name is...
-Oh, do take down that hood, child.

159
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,391
Don't you think I know who you are?

160
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,476
You think I'd let my intended
leave the Eyrie on urgent business

161
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,553
without knowing what that business was?

162
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,594
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.

163
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,509
My flesh and blood.

164
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,276
It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

165
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,395
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

166
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,119
-I understand.
-No one can know you're here.

167
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,269
It would put us in a very precarious position.

168
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,792
lwould never say athing.

169
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,995
The Lannisters want to destroy us.

170
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,071
They've been trying for years.

171
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,036
Now they know what it feels like.

172
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,589
Mummy said they killed your mother
and they chopped off your brother's head.

173
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,678
They did, and my father's.

174
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,388
They killed my father, too, with poison.

175
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,591
lwanted to make
the little Lannister baby man fly, (CHUCKLES)

176
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,397
but Mother said I couldn't.

177
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,198
Make him fly?

178
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,989
Through the Moon Door.

00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,035
they made you marry that filthy troll.

182
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:47,634
They made us both.
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

183
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,517
LYSA: I don't believe that.

184
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,518
Did he force himself on you?

185
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,748
-No. We never...
-LYSA: Good.

186
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,919
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.

187
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,830
But you're not to call her Sansa
in front of anyone

188
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,876
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

189
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,991
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

190
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,232
It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

191
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,155
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
Take the back stairs.

192
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,195
Go. We'll speak soon.

193
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:27,077
What took you so long?

194
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,754
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen l,

195
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,116
extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

196
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,192
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

197
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,872
Let's get married tonight.

198
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,633
Ought we not...

199
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,188
...inform the Lords ofthe Vale
about the ceremony?

200
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,998
(HUFFS) There's only one Lord ofthe Vale.

201
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,798
The others can all hang.

202
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,872
Lurking and simpering on the stairs
like buzzards the moment my husband died,

203
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,427
-trying to get their claws in me.
-I do thinkthat we could wait until...

204
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,069
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

205
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,357
We had our wedding night many years ago.

206
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:03,554
Or don't you remember?

207
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,070
Like it was yesterday.

208
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,311
What wife would do foryou
the things I've done?

209
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,318
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

210
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,835
When you gave me those drops

211
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,309
and told me to pourthem into Jon's wine,

212
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,833
my husband's wine.

213
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,912
When you told me to write a letter to Cat

214
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,398
telling her it was the...

The deed is done.

217
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,839
Faded into nothing.

218
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,070
Only speaking of it can make it real.

219
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,034
Tonight it is, then.

220
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,953
(LAUGHS)

221
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,791
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

222
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,397
Once l'm presentable,
I'll call on the Septon immediately.

223
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,755
l'm warning you.

224
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,116
I'm going to scream when
my husband makes love to me.

225
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,272
So loud they'll hear me
clear across the Narrow Sea.

TYWIN: When will the wedding take place
in your mind?

231
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,077
CERSEI: As soon as decency permits.

232
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,676
After we've allowed Tommen
the appropriate time to mourn his brother

233
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,317
and Margaery to mourn her husband.

234
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,437
-A fortnight?
-That seems reasonable.

235
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,592
Nojugglers, nojousting dwarves,

236
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,874
no 77-course meals.

237
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,077
And your wedding to Loras?

238
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,799
Shortly after Tommen's.

239
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,916
-Shortly?
-A fortnight.

240
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,590
I know you don't like them.

241
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,671
I didn't like your husband.

242
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,068
Used to pat me on the back a lot.

243
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,309
ldidn'ttrust him.

244
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,273
We had that in common.

245
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,671
You don't need to make formal alliances
with people you trust.

246
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,193
Then whom can we trust?

247
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,755
Ourselves alone.

248
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,510
The Tyrells

249
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,558
are our only true rivals in terms of resources

250
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,632
and we need them on our side.

251
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:45,438
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

252
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,987
Robert had me funding him.

253
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,358
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

254
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,750
I suppose that explains
why we did so well in the last one.

255
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,388
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

256
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,514
Haven't a clue.

257
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,191
Your best guess.

258
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,875
Pounds, tons, ounces?

259
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,109
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

260
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,708
Can't be.

261
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,633
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.

262
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,716
Then how do we pay for anything?

263
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,759
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos
a tremendous amount of money.

264
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,238
How much?

265
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,795
Atremendous amount.

266
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,591
There must be someone at the Iron Bank
you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

267
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,956
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.
There is no someone.

268
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,474
Someone does workthere.
It is comprised of people.

269
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,595
And a temple is comprised of stones.

270
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,752
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

271
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:44,991
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

272
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,432
That's what the Iron Bank is, atemple.

273
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:51,875
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

274
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,075
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

275
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,232
You can't sway them with excuses.

276
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,756
lfyou owe them money
and you don't want to crumble yourself,

277
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,352
you pay it back.

278
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,115
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown
will help a great deal.

279
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,554
It's for the good ofthe family,
I understand that.

280
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,076
I'm not sure my brothers do.

281
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,277
I know you're building a strong case
against Tyrion.

282
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,388
And as a mother, that is your right.

283
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:30,631
But as ajudge,
I cannot discuss the trial with you.

284
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:32,910
I respect that.

285
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:37,037
We don't need to discuss it.

286
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:43,628
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing that matters.

287
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,994
You've started wars to protect this family.

288
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,193
Turned your back on Jaime
for refusing to contribute to its future.

289
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,589
What does Tyrion deserve

290
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,716
for lighting that future on fire?

The Mountain.

301
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,198
Would you shut up?

302
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,598
I can't sleep until I saythe names.

303
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:37,075
The names of
every fucking person in Westeros?

304
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,631
Onlythe ones I'm going to kill.

Hate's as good a thing as any
to keep a person going.

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,077
Betterthan most.

308
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:50,437
We come across my brother,

309
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,238
maybe we can both cross a name off our list.

310
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,674
If he were here right now, what would you do?

311
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,228
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up
so I can get some sleep.

312
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,351
Go on, get it over with,
your list of doomed men.

313
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,511
I'm almost done.

314
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,870
Only one name left.

315
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,272
Go on.

316
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,509
The Hound.

317
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,795
SANSA: Thank you.

318
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:46,631
Your mother always had a sweet tooth.

319
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,198
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

320
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,238
At suppertime,
she would go straight for honey cakes,

321
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,912
candied almonds, custard.

322
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,398
Anything sweet.

323
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,597
Eventually, your grandfather had to assign
a septa to watch her at meals.

324
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,034
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

325
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,599
It was important that she remain desirable

326
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,148
so Father could arrange a good match for her

327
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:07,707
and she was starting to get fat.

328
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,268
My mother fat?

329
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,633
(BOTH CHUCKLE LIGHTLY)

330
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,275
She never let me have my pudding
until I'd finished all my proper food.

331
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,517
This is before she married your father
and moved to the North.

332
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,955
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity had become hers.

333
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,790
Marriage changes people.

334
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,828
(GASPS)

335
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,275
I didn't mean foryou to stop. Enjoythem.

336
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,077
How do you like them?

337
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,037
They're delicious.

338
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,268
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't growthem up here.

339
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,917
Oh, gods, no.

340
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,991
Petyr had three crates
brought all the way from King's Landing.

341
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,035
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

342
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,348
He's so kind.

343
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,113
He really cares for you.

344
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,997
Think where you'd be without him.

345
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,274
In their clutches, on trial for murder.

346
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,507
Yes. I'm very lucky.

347
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,032
He feels responsible for you.

348
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,713
-Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
-Why?

349
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,874
Why does he feel responsible for you?

350
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:16,437
Well, I'm half Tully.
He loved your family so much.

351
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,554
-Loved your mother.
-No.

352
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,072
That's what you wanted to say.

353
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,948
-He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.
-Your mother never loved him.

354
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,634
Cat always went straight for
the sweetest thing.

00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:53,036
We'll find our own way.

You want to stay here?

716
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:02,559
(SPITS) Burn it to the ground

717
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,429
and all the dead with it.
