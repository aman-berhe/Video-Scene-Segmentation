Your Grace, I want to say...

2
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,878
You will not speak.

3
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,276
How do I know you are who you say you are?

4
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,797
If only I were otherwise.

5
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,677
Ifyou are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

6
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,228
to pay your family back
forwhat it did to mine?

7
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,708
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

8
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,156
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

9
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,671
I killed my father, Tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

10
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,475
lam the greatest Lannister killer of our time.

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,630
So I should welcome you into my service

12
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,756
because you murdered members
of your own family?

13
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,877
Into your service?

14
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,869
We have onlyjust met.

15
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,555
It's too soon to know
ifyou deserve my service.

16
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:45,473
lfyou'd rather return to the fighting pits,
just saythe word.

17
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,835
When I was ayoung man, I heard a story

18
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,639
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

19
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,951
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,
only a name

20
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,429
and a handful of supporters,
most of whom probably thought

21
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,113
they could use that name
to benefit themselves.

22
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,589
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

23
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,433
often hours ahead
ofthe men who'd been sent to kill her.

24
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,670
She was eventually sold offto some warlord
on the edge ofthe world

25
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,478
and that appeared to be that.

26
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,953
Then, a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

27
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,753
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

28
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,071
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span oftime,

29
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,831
along with three dragons.

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,950
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

31
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,549
I thought you were worth meeting,
at the very least.

32
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,231
And why are you worth meeting?

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,151
Why should I spend mytime listening to you?

34
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,800
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

35
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,554
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule,

36
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,437
the strengths and weaknesses ofthe houses
that will eitherjoin or oppose you.

37
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,589
I will have a very large army.

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,754
And very large dragons.

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,229
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
When I served as Hand ofthe King,
I did quite well with the latter,

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,628
considering the king in question

42
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,870
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

43
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,709
I could do an even betterjob
advising a ruler worth the name.

44
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,077
lfthat is indeed what you are.

45
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,638
So you want to advise me?

46
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,353
Very well.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,558
What would you have me do with him?

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,239
I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

49
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,513
I know.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,390
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

51
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,439
Whomever Ser Jorah was
when he started informing on you,

52
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,277
he is no longerthat man.

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,670
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
as devoted to anything

54
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,397
as he is to serving you.

55
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,354
He claims he would kill foryou
and die foryou

56
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,318
and nothing I have witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

57
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,998
And yet he did betray you.

58
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,594
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

59
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,948
Yes.

60
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,676

DAENERYS: No.

Not until forced to do so.

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,196
He worships you.

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,315
He is in love with you, I think.

65
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,831
But he did not trust you with the truth.

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,117
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

67
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,037
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

68
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,871
So I should kill him?

69
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:48,997
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

70
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,678
And you're going to need to inspire devotion,
a lot of it,

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,197

when you do.

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,556
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

177
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,708
come and see his mother.

178
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,314
He... I tried. He wouldn't see me.

179
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,072
He won't see anyone.

180
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:18,672
I can't stay here.

181
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,834
There is a way.

182
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,948
Away out.

183
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,474
Confess?

184
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,914
To the High Sparrow? I won't.

185
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,633
lmade him.

186
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,718
l rose him up from nothing.

187
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,313
lwill not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

188
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,992
and beg his forgiveness.

189
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,191
Goodbye.

190
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,268
The work continues.

191
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,433
VVhy?

192
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,958
Why, Theon?

193
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,118
Not Theon. There is no Theon.

194
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,518
-Reek.
-Reek.

195
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,716
Why did you tell him, Reek?

196
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,718
lwas helping you.

197
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,598
You wanted to escape.

198
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,238
There is no escape.

199
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,714
Not ever.

200
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,831
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

201
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,991
The master knew.

202
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,393
He knows everything.

203
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:07,227
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross

204
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,154
and cut away piece after piece
until there was no Theon left.

205
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,838
Good.

206
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,997
If it weren't foryou, I'd still have a family.

207
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,678
lfl could do what Ramsay did to you

208
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,751
right here, right now, lwould.

209
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,038
l deserved everything.

210
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,872
I deserve to be Reek.

211
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:43,037
I did terrible things.

212
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,713
Turned on Robb.

213
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,238
Captured Winterfell.

214
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,590
-Ki||ed those boys.
-They weren't "those boys."

215
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,829
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

216
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,399
You'd known them since they were born.

217
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,799
They weren't. They were only...

218
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:58,914
Only what?

219
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,474
-I can't.
-Tell me.

220
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,992
I can't, not unless the master says.

221
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,148
-Tell me. They weren't what?
-They weren't...

222
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:08,437
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

223
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,432
Tell me to my face, Theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

224
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,953
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

225
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,759
I couldn't find them.

226
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,118
It was two farm boys.

227
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,949
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

228
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,793
You didn't...

229
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,352
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

230
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,349
I can't talk to you any more.

231
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,749
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

232
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,875
Not Theon! Reek!

233
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,033
(DOOR SLAMS)

234
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,316
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

235
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,230
More than half ofthose
are mounted, however.

236
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,436
And how high do Stannis' horsesjump?

237
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,194
Our walls have been fully repaired.
The gates have been reinforced.

238
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,313
We have enough food for six months.

239
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,311
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

240
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:16,473
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

241
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,714
You disagree?

242
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,110
Stannis isn't from the North. You are, Father.

243
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,912
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people ofthe North

244
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:30,593
how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

245
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,749
And what do you recommend?

246
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,431
That we not sit and wait for Stannis to decide

247
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,555
what sort of fight this is going to be.

248
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:39,598
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

249
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,592
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

250
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,157
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

251
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,831
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

252
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,877
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even ifwe wanted to.

253
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,711
I don't need an army.

254
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,555
I need 20 good men.

255
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,078
So, have you decided yet?

256
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,195
Whether l'm worthy of your service?

257
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,752
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

258
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,636
It's probably my safest option.

259
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,351
I could see why you would think so.

260
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,792
It's what your father would have done.

261
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,199
And what would your father have done?

262
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:30,188
My father, who publically
sentenced me to death?

263
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,552
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

264
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,755
Is that why you killed him?

265
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,919
Someday, ifyou decide not to execute me,

266
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,549
I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.

267
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,949
And on that day, should it ever come,

268
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,751
we'll need more wine than this.

269
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,398
I know what my father was.

270
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,832
What he did.

271
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,791
lknowthe Mad King earned his name.

272
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,069
So, here we sit.

273
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,394
Two terrible children oftwo terrible fathers.

274
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,112
l'm terrible?

275
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,474
I've heard stories.

276
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,518
Why did you travel to the far side ofthe world

277
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,351
to meet someone terrible?

278
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,271
To see ifyou were the right kind ofterrible.

279
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,394
Which kind is that?

280
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:19,312
The kind that prevents your people
from being even more so.

281
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,876
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

282
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,632
Under my rule, murderwill once again
become entertainment.

283
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,471
Yes, that was wise.

284
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,597
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe
forthe greater good.

285
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,715
Very impressive.

286
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,118
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

287
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,315
though not by choice,

288
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:40,391
and certainly not for the greater good,
gods forbid.

289
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,798
She ended up having him killed.

290
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,070
Perhaps it won't come to that.

291
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:56,151
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

292
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,113
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

293
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,589
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

294
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:06,474
He was my travelling companion,
before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

295
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,596
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

296
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,797
For 20 years, the spider
oversawthe campaign to find and kill me.

297
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,439
He did what he had to do to survive.

298
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,478
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

299
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,029
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

300
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,310
-But you trust him?
-Yes, oddly.

301
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,152
He may be the only person in the world I trust.

302
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,439
Except my brother.

303
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,715
The brotherwho killed my father?

304
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,355
That's the one.

305
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,237
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

306
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,753
Your queenly prerogative.

307
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,232
I had given up on life

308
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:45,598
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

309
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,192
I'm not going to killyou.

310
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,628
No?

311
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,991
-Banish me?
-No.

312
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,392
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished...

313
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:08,912
You're going to advise me.

314
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,874
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

315
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,513
-Advise you on what?
-How to get what I want.

316
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,278
The Iron Throne.

317
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,876
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

318
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,427
If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool.

319
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,431
I'm not entirelyjoking.

320
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,159
There's more to the world than Westeros.

321
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:36,198
How many hundreds ofthousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

322
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,590
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

323
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,514
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

324
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,511
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

325
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,352
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

326
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,752
But this is not my home.

327
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,433
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

328
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,952
The common people.

329
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,554
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

330
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,675
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support ofthe common people

331
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:03,875
and onlythe common people.

332
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,948
What was that like?

333
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,431
Ruling without the rich?

334
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,191
House Targaryen is gone.

335
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,077
Not a single person who shares your blood
is alive to support you.

336
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,716
The Starks are gone as well.
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

337
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,348
The remaining members of House Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

338
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,914
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

339
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:26,071
His entire claim to the throne rests on
the illegitimacy of yours.

340
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,912
That leaves the Tyrells.

341
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,268
Not impossible.

342
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,474
Not enough.

343
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,869
Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

344
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,830
They're all just spokes on a wheel.

345
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,672
This one's on top, then that one's on top.

346
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,833
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

347
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,760
It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

348
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,273
You're not the first person
