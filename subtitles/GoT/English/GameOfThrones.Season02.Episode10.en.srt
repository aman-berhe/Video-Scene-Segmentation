-No, stealing is a crime.

178
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,508
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

179
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,272
-Where are you taking him?
-To Riverrun.

180
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,039
Why Riverrun?

181
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,758
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

182
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,990
-Why not kill him?
-For stealing a pig?

183
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,192
I don't give the orders.

184
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,633
He must be important to someone.

185
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,439
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

186
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,910
All right, have it yourway,

187
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,069
my lady.

188
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,718
-Do I know you?
-Have you been to Ashemark?

189
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,350
-No.
-Then you don't know me.

190
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,319
Do you ever go to the river market
at Salt Rock?

191
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,595
-Is it near Ashemark?
-No.

192
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,193
I've never been there.

193
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,632
What do you think ofthese beauties?

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,113
I hope you gave them quick deaths.

195
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,871
Two ofthem we did, yeah.

196
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,074
Wait.

197
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,833
I do know you.

198
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,511
That's Jaime Lannister.

199
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,191
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

200
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,588
Ifthis is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

201
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,159
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

202
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,829
-I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.
-(CHUCKLES)

203
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,275
They dragged him out ofthe woods
and threw him down before the king.

204
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,748
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

205
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,671
If he was, I'd only be travelling his head.

206
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,957
I have a question foryou both.

207
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,315
And I want you to answer it at the same time.

208
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,470
I count to three, you both answer.

209
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,593
What's his name?

210
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,394
One.

211
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,510
Two. Three.

212
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,073
(GROANS)

213
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,434
(GRUNTS)

214
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,879
Two quick deaths.

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,395
-(STABB|NG)
-(GROAN|NG)

216
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,992
(PANTING)

217
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,677
Those were Stark men.

218
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,071
I don't serve the Starks.

219
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,751
I serve Lady Catelyn.

220
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,715
I told you I'd take you to King's Landing,
and that's what I'm going to do.

221
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,229
Stay.

222
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,195
(GRUNTS)

223
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,438
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

224
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,148
I knowthat.

225
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,555
And you mean to do it anyway?

226
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,318
I love her.

227
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,270
I know that seems important to you.

228
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,872
It is important to me.

229
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:33,917
Your father didn't love me when we married.

230
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,630
He hardly knew me or I him.

231
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,154
Love didn't just happen to us.

232
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,789
We built it slowly over the years,

233
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,473
stone by stone,

234
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,156
for you, for your brothers and sisters,
for all of us.

235
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,276
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

236
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,632
but it is stronger.

237
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,273
It lasts longer.

238
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,230
And that is what would be in store for me
with one of Walder Frey's daughters,

239
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,629
-what you and father had?
-Why not?

240
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:09,592
Because she's not beautiful?

241
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,511
Because she's not exotic and exciting?

242
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,393
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

243
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,232
And you agreed to it.

244
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,476
You gave him yourword.

245
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,589
Treat your oaths recklessly,
and your people will do the same.

246
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,278
lfyour father lived his life for one thing...

247
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,952
My father is dead.

248
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,875
And the only parent I have left
has no right to call anyone reckless.

249
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,231
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

250
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,794
You said you saw my victory in the flames.

251
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,995
MELISANDRE: I did.

252
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,068
-I still see it.
-The flames lied.

253
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,310
And I'm no betterthan a savage

254
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,350
trusting in a fire god.

255
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,839
I fought foryour god in Blackwater Bay.

256
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:12,117
I led my men to the gates ofthe seventh hell

257
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,073
as their brothers burned alive, and for what?

258
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,038
Attacked from behind
by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

259
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,950
lfyou see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

260
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,792
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

261
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,110
You claimed to speak for a god.

262
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,270
Will you quitthe war
just because you've lost a battle?

263
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,589
You talk about war as ifyou understand it.

264
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,557
I've been fighting far longer than you.

265
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:32,754
Have you?

266
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,997
Show me how you fight.

267
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,998
(CHOKING)

268
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,553
Show me.

269
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,517
Where's your god now?

270
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,797
Will he save you?

271
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,871
Where is your god?

272
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,519
Inside you.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

275
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,237
I murdered my brother.

276
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,833
We murdered him.

277
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,399
Share the weight with me.

278
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:23,276
He wasn't your brother.

279
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,236
This war has just begun.

280
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,350
It will last foryears.

281
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,468
Thousands will die at your command.

282
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,513
You will betray the men serving you.

283
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,676
You will betray your family.

284
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:46,357
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

285
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,311
And it will all be worth it

286
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,951
because you are the Son of Fire.

287
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,394
You are the Warrior of Light.

288
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,872
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

289
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,238
You will be king.

290
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,269
You promise these things,

291
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,638
but you don't know.

292
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,998
None of us know.

293

Let me show you.

294
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,555
Look into the fire, my king.

295
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,068

-Keep looking.

Do you see?

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,998
Do you see, my king?

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,189
Yes.

I know I'm surrounded.

307

I knowthat because
I stood on the battlements

308
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,951
and saw I was surrounded.

309

They don't want you to sleep.

First time I saw Winterfell,

320
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:22,318
it looked like something
that had been here forthousands of years

321
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:26,109
and would be here for thousands of years
after I was dead.

322
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,071
I saw it and I thought,

323
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,873
"Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion
and killed my brothers.

324
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,511
"We never stood a chance against
the man who lives here."

00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,193
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,716
Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me ofthat.

327
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:51,870
Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
has always loved reminding me ofthat.

328

how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?

wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.

And even if! did, even if by some miracle
I slipped through the lines and made it home,
