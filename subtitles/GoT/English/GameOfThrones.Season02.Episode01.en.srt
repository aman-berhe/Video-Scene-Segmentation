has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,674
He'll have an answer for you.

528
00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:55,112
Whetheryou believe it...

529
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,033
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

530
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,509
Who knows what they want?

531
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,397
A mockingbird.

532
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,312
-You created your own sigil, didn't you?
-Yes.

533
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,868
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

534
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:13,472
I'm glad you like it.

535
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:16,869
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

536
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,315
Others have to find their own way.

537
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,755
I heard a song once

538
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,354
about a boy of modest means

539
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:27,828
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

540
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,633
He loved the eldest daughter.

541
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,949
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

542
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,074
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

543
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:43,231
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

544
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,189
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

545
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,955
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

546
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,075
especially in a prominent family.

547
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:54,354
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

548
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,719
I've found.

549
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:59,670
And which truth is that?

550
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,989
Knowledge is power.

551
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,549
Seize him.

552
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:11,191
Cut his throat.

553
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,910
Stop. Wait.

554
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,950
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

555
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,432
Step back three paces.

556
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:24,477
Turn around.

557
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,599
Close your eyes.

558
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,434
Do see ifyou can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

559
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,272
to locate the Stark girl for me.

560
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,920
I would very much appreciate it.

561
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,191
ROBB: You're Ser Alton Lannister?

562
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,711
lam, Your Grace.

563
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,031
ROBB: l offeryour cousins peace
ifthey meet my terms.

564
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,232
First, your family must release my sisters.

565
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,718
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

566
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:13,315
so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

567
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:17,278
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

568
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,075
Their families can honourthem
with proper funerals.

569
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,832
-An honourable request, Your Grace.
-Third...

570
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,917
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion ofthe North.

571
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,030
From this time till the end oftime,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

572
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:36,075
The King in the North.

573
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,434
-King in the North.
-King in the North.

574
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,069
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

575
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:44,070
If he disregards this command,

576
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,912
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

577
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,592
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

578
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:54,876
These are... Your Grace, these are...

579
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,349
These are my terms.

580
00:38:57,439 --> 00:39:00,397
lfthe Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

581
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,707
If not,

582
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:05,794
I will litter the South with Lannister dead.

583
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,474
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

584
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,073
Oh, is he?

585
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,828
You'll ride at daybreak, SerAlton.

586
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,994
That will be all fortonight.

587
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,270
Aword, Your Grace?

588
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,680
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

589
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:40,227
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

590
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,237
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

591
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:45,229
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

592
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,117
Of course they are.

593
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,395
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

594
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,597
but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

595
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:57,436
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

596
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,874
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

597
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,678
Men who fought my father.

598
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:03,909
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

599
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,469
from the yoke ofthe South,
just like you're doing now.

600
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,717
l'm his only living son.

601
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,633
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

602
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,680
I'm not a Stark. l knowthat.

603
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,993
But your father raised me
to be an honourable man.

604
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,154
We can avenge him together.

605
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,315
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

606
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:33,549
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

607
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,393
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

608
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,878
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

609
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,756
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

610
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,515
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

611
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,709
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

612
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,429
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

613
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,669
Before me, it was Father.

614
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,318
You married one rebel and mothered another.

615
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,194
lmothered more than just rebels,

616
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,430
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

617
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:04,592
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

618
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,751
You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?

619
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,717
And Arya...

620
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,351
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not forthem?

621
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,829
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

622
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,235
It's time for me to go home.

623
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:38,072
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

624
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,190
You can't go to Winterfell.

625
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,433
I beg your pardon?

626
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,751
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

627
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,038
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

628
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,076
Why in the name of all the gods...

629
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:56,754
Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

630
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,831
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

631
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,591
You know him. You know his family.

632
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,988
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

633
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,274
You have a hundred other lords...

634
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,238
Which ofthese lords
do I trust more than you?

635
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,839
lf Renly sides with us,

636
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:13,274
we'll outnumber them two to one.

637
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,079
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

638
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,673
We'll get the girls back.

639
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:21,557
Then we'll all go home, for good.

640
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,558
I will ride at first light.

641
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,072
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

642
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,749
You've done so well.

643
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,753
Your fatherwould be proud.

644
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:06,118
-Give Lord Renly my regards.
-King Renly.

645
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:09,788
There's a king in every corner now.

646
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:24,037
What is all this?

647
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,110
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

648
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,918
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

649
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:32,559
That is a seat for a conqueror.

650
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,075
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

651
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,434
We can't find Arya Stark.

652
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,431
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

653
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,510
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

654
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,750
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

655
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,195
I think they might. They're weak.

656
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:49,156
They put too much value on their women.

657
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:52,711
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

658
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,677
Send out as many men as we can.

659
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,512
I'm sure ifyou asked Grandfather...

660
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,239
The king does not ask, he commands.

661
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,998
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

662
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,752
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

663
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,637
His life is in danger.

664
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:10,077
We're at war.

665
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,195
All our lives are in danger.

666
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,600
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

667
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:20,627
And you.

668
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:25,395
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

669
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,277
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

670
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,557
Of course it is.

671
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:34,475
No one believes this foul gossip.

672
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:36,470
Someone believes it.

673
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:39,870
Father had other children?

674
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,590
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

675
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:44,158
(HAMMERS CLATTERING)

676
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,438
What are you asking?

677
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:49,592
I'm asking if he fucked otherwomen
when he grewtired of you.

678
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:51,909
How many bastards does he have running...

679
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,993
(WORK STOPS)

680
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,152
What you just did is punishable by death.

681
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,510
You will never do it again.

682
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:18,751
Never.

683
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,591
That will be all, Mother.

684
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,076
(SCREAMING)

685
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:35,036
No, no, no, no.

686
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,839
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

687
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,272
Ease into it.

688
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,238
Slowly, with passion.

689
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:45,713
Oh, yeah.

690
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:49,558
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

691
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:52,028
Both of you are working tonight.

692
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,636
We do things differently here, Daisy.

693
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:01,428
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

694
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,392
Our establishment doesn't cater
to ploughmen and goat herders.

695
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:10,117
Lord Olsen.

696
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:12,076
Taste is everything here.

697
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,990
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

698
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,637
Don't call him Littlefinger.

699
