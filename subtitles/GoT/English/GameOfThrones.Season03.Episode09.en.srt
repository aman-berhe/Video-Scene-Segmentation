Oh, Ned forbade it.

543
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,313

if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.

545

seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.

there's no real proof

550

the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

No, but there
are other ways of providing proof.

I don't know.

I know what we should name him.

Oh, do you?

556
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,716
It seems to me the father
should have some say in his son's naming.
