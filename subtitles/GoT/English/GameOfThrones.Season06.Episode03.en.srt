after Khal Drogo died?

183
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,590
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn,

184
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,079
the Breaker of Chains,

185
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,151
the Queen of Meereen
and the Mother of Dragons.

186
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:48,116
My place is not here with you.

187
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,673
You were the wife ofthe Great Khal.

188
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,237
You thought he would conquer the
world with you at his side.

189
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,719
He didn't.

190
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,195
l was the wife ofthe Great Khal.

191
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,708
Khal Savo.

192
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,429
I thought he would conquer the world
with me at his side.

193
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,431
You're young.

194
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,513
We were all young once.

195
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:17,752
But we all understand the way things are.

196
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,156
You will learn as well,

197
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:23,072
ifyou are fortunate enough to stay with us.

198
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,312
Where else would I go?

199
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,350
Every Khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.

200
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:32,233
Yes. Immediately after the death oftheir khal.

201
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,992
But you went out into the world.

202
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,831
That is forbidden.

203
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,992
All the khalasars have returned
forthe KhalarVezhven.

204
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:46,873
They will decide which cities will be sacked
and which tribes will be enslaved.

205
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,312
And now they must decide what to do
with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow.

206
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,112
With luck, your place will be here
with us, Mother of Dragons.

207
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:58,037
It is the best you can hope for, now.

208
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,909
I don't know how you stand it
in all that leather.

209
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,674

210
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,833
You look lovely today, my dear. You really do.

211
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:37,674
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

212
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,070
lfyou're going to torture me,
just call them back and get on with it.

213
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,592
lam not atorturer.

214
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,313
Though it so often is what people deserve.

215
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,872
And it does provide answers.

216
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,871
But they're usually the wrong answers.

217
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:58,235
My job is to find the right answers.

218
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,311
Do you know how I do that?

219
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:02,629
I do it by making people happy.

220
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,797
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

221
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,236
That's your name, isn't it? Vala.

222
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,319
(CHUCKLES) That's all right.
I know who you are and what you've done.

223
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,717
You've done a lot.

224
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,633
You've sacrificed your body for a cause,
which is more than most people do.

225
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,034
And you've helped the Sons ofthe Harpy
murderthe Unsullied and the Second Sons.

226
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,873
The Unsullied and the Second Sons
are foreign soldiers,

227
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:36,190
brought here by a foreign queen
to destroy our city and our history.

228
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,228
I understand.

229
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,591
Well, that makes perfect sense
from your perspective.

230
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,557
l have a different perspective, of course.

231
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,313
I think it's important that you try to see things
from my perspective,

232
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,470
just as I will try to see them from yours.

233
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:59,597
Because that is the only way
that I can make you and Dom happy.

234
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:05,632
That is how you pronounce it, "Dom"?

235
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,075
I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.

236
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:12,790
Such a handsome boy.

237
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,236
Those big, brown eyes.
Good luck keeping the ladies away.

238
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,749
Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?

239
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:23,114
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

240
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,229
Children are blameless.

241
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,798
l have never hurt them.

242
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,231
Your boy is in no immediate danger,
this I swear to you.

243
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:39,349
But between us, dear,
you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.

244
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,510
We both knowthe penalty forthat crime.

245
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,676
How will poor Dom get on
without his mother?

246
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,478
And with his breathing problem.

247
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,278
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

248
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,951
So either you kill me or they do.

249
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,918
Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.

250
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,996
There is athird option, though.

251
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,151
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

252
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:10,788
I've already booked passage
for awoman and heryoung son.

253
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,151
I'll even throw in a bag of silver
to help you start again.

254
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,596
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask
one of our leather-clad friends

255
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,908
back in to carry it.

256
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,993
Far too heavy for me.

257
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,152
The boat sails at dawn.

258
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,954
You need to decide now.

259
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:31,596
A new life foryou and Dom, or...

260
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,355
What should we do while we wait?
To pass the time, what should we do?

261
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:52,914
What should we talk about?

262
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,833
You speak 19 languages.

263
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,354
You must occasionally use some ofthem
to talk about things.

264
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,594
You two, you spend
a great deal oftime together.

265
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,470
What would you be talking about
if I weren't here?

266
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,068
Patrol.

267
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,715
When lam going on patrol with the Unsullied.

268
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,070
What we see on patrol.
Who we captured on patrol.

269
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,431
That's good. That's very good.

270
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,310
But that's a report.
l was thinking more of a conversation.

271
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,393
A wise man once said,
"The true history ofthe world

272
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:32,596
"is the history of great conversations
in elegant rooms."

273
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,874
Who said this?

274
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,036
Me. Just now.

275
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:48,515
All right, no conversations. Let's play a game.

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,591
You don't play games?
Either one of you, ever?

277
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,828
Games are for children.

278

279

00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,237
Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?

355
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,595
Not yet.

356
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:53,197
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

357
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,952
Don't stop at the city.

358
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,990
I want little birds in Dome,
in Highgarden, in the North.

359

If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

360
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,234
I want to hear it.

361
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,591
If someone is laughing at the queen

362
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,240
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

363
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,912
I want to hear.

364
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,195
I want to know who they are.
I want to know where they are.

beurn is worse.

I told them all. I told them.
He's arrogant, dangerous.

367
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:33,078
You don't get thrown out ofthe Citadel
without good reason.

368
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,875
And no one listened to my advice.
So here we are.

369
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,475
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane
is an abomination.

370
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:43,998
We never sanctioned this experiment.

371
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,716
And |, for one,
think it would be in our best interest

372
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,074
to have the beast...

(PYCELLE FLATULATES)

00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,711
-Can I help you?
-Why are you here?

00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,075
-My mother...
-I was invited, my dear,

376
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,915
to help deal with several troublesome issues,
such as the queen's imprisonment.

377
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,872
Thank you for bringing it up.

378
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,950
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses | endured.

379
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,272
Margaery is the queen.

380
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,068
You are not the queen
because you're not married to the king.

381
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,358
I do appreciate these things
can get a bit confusing in your family.

382
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,634
This is a Small Council meeting.
You have no position on the Small Council.

383
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,550
I'm the Lord Commander ofthe Kingsguard.

384
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,756
The Lord Commander ofthe Kingsguard
does have a position on the Small Council.

385
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,592
Grand Maester Pycelle,
would you sanction that statement?

386
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,229
Well, uh... (MUTTERS)

387
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,268
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

388
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,756
Of course, that was the Mad King.

389
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,989
King Robert saw things differently.
And King...

390
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,037
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

391
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,597
Do you consider the murder
of your own blood atroublesome issue?

392
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:57,277
The same women who murdered Myrcella

393
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,589
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

394
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,553
We've got a lot to discuss. All of us, together.

395
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:07,279
And seeing as you cannot make us leave,
we best get on with it.

396
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,831
No, we cannot make you leave.
And you cannot make us stay.

397
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,193

thatthing murder us all.

her daughter's final resting place.

401
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,715
Ah, I'm sorry, Your Grace.
That's not possible. Not yet.

402
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,438
When will it be possible?

403
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,350
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

404
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,719
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked through the streets

405
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,518
in front ofthe whole city.

406
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,191
That wasn't the full atonement?

407
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:19,748
No.

408
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,394
She must stand trial before seven septons,
so we can learn the true extent of her sins.

409

let her see Myrcella's resting place.

00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,228
You are.

412
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,352
And what does that mean to you?

413
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,839
It means a great deal to me.

414
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,707
The Crown and the Faith
are the twin pillars ofthe world.

415
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,633
Do you know who told me that?

416
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,748
Your mother.

417
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,750
My mother who is unclean?

418
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:52,396
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

419
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,588
How do you think the Mother Above
first came to us?

420
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,670
How did men and women first come to
feel the Mother's presence, hmm?

421
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,752
It was through their own mothers.

422
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,952
There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei.
You knowthat.

423
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,873
But when she speaks of you,
the Mother's love outshines it all.

424
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,715
Her love foryou is more real
than anything else in this world

425
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,552
because it doesn't come from this world.

426
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,439
But you knowthat.

427
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,918
You've felt it.

428
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,113
You've seen her when she talks to you.

429
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,273
Yes.

430
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,272

When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

438
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,510
she did it to get back to you.

439
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:25,354

why you want to put her

It's not what I want. It's what the gods want.

442

They make theirwill known to us,
and it's up to us to either accept or reject it.

Except for the part about the gods.

swear loyalty to me as Warden ofthe North,

526
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,155
and we will fight together

527
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,840
to destroythe bastard
and all his wildling friends.

528
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,751
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

529
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:48,793
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

530
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,473
I'm not doing that either.

531
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,199
Why would I trust a man
who won't honour tradition?

532
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,115
Your father honoured tradition.

533
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,988
Knelt for Robb Stark.
Called him King ofthe North.

534
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,190
Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?

535
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,315
Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.

536
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:09,438
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
I've got a gift foryou.

537
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,199
A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.

538
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,318
A girl, aye.

539
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,678
(SMALLJON LAUGHS)

540
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:20,874
Awild one.

541
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,274
||ikethem wild.

542
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,478
And a boy, nice and young.

543
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,427
The way Karstark likes them.

544
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:40,876
(PANTING)

545
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:45,748
-Who's this?
-Rickon Stark.

546
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,078
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

547
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,554
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

548
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:32,992
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

549
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,789
It's time.

550
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,637
lfyou have any last words, now is the time.

551
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,154
You shouldn't be alive. It's not right.

552
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,068
Neitherwas killing me.

553
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:34,352
My mother's still living at White Harbor.
Could you write her?

554
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,678
Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

555
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:49,188
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

556
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,114
Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

557
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:55,508
You brought an army of wildlings
into our lands.

558
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,433
An army of murderers and raiders.

559
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,399
|f| had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

560
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:07,277
I pray I'd make the right choice again.

561
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,232
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

562
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,993
I fought, I lost.

563
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,869
Now I rest.

564
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:19,752
But you, Lord Snow,

565
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,030
you'll be fighting their battles forever.

566
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,518
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

567
00:47:20,919 --> 00:47:22,716
(CHOKING, GASPING)

568
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,307
We should burn the bodies.

569
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:10,474
You should.

570
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,590
What do you want me to do with this?

571
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,796
Wear it. Burn it.

572
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,428
Whatever you want.

573
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,759
You have Castle Black.

574
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,907
My watch is ended.
