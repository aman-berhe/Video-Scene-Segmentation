1
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,478
(Wooden swords clanking)

2
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,993
Yahl Left high, left law.

3
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,354
(Swords clanging, men shouting)

4
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,910
Right low, lunge light.

5
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,547
You break anything,
the septa will have my head.

6
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,954
- What is...
- (Screaming)

7
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,554
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

8
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,635
- How she could forget...
- She didn‘t forget.

9
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,193
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

10
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,914
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

11
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,156
- Hushl
- (Swords clanging, men yelling)

12
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,669
Go back to your room.

13
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,075
Bar the doors and do not open them
for anyone you do not know.

14
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,997
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

15
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,031
Runl

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,071
- (Man) This wayl
- (Door banging)

17
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,998
(Screaming)

18
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,353
Left, light. Rahl

19
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,552
- Now you are dead.
- You said light,

20
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,272
but you went left.

21
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,869
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'oause you lied.

22
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:27,958
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

23
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,196
- You were not seeing.
- l was so. lwatched, but you...

24
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,279
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

25
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,788
The seeing, the true seeing,

26
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,195
that is the heart of swordplay.

27
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,230
(Door opens)

28
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,234
Arya Stark. come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

29
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,275
And why is it that Lord Eddard
is sending Lannister men

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,913
in place of his own?

31
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,396
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.

32
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,512
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

33
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,588
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

34
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,869
(Laughs) Take her.

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,709
Are you men or snakes,
that you would threaten a child?

36
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,910
Get out of my way, little man.

37
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,118
I am Sync Forel...

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,037
Foreign bastard.

39
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,314
..and you will be speaking to me
with more respect.

40
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,637
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

41
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,832
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

42
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,315
Run to your father.

43
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,038
Bloody oafs.

44
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,035
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me. Run.

45
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,439
The ﬁrst sword of Braavos does not run.

46
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,036
- (Wood clatters)
- What do we say

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,515
to the god of death?

48
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,277
Not today.

49
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,869
Go.

50
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,039
(Men moaning)

51
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,751
(Swords ringing)
(Men screaming)

52
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,031
Not today. Not today.

53
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,191
(GBSPS)

54
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,709
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.

55
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,435
|'||... I'll tell the queen.

56
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,996
(Chucldes) Who do you think sent me?

57
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,029
(Horses neighing)

58
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,471
Needle.

59
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,830
There she is.

60
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,792
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

61
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,435
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queenl

62
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,991
- Stay awayl
- (Gasm)

63
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,269
(Door clanging, creaking)

64
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,715
Lord Stark. you must be thirsty.

65
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,235
Varys.

66
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,316
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

68
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,877
Not so much, my lord.

69
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,069
I would save the rest, if I were you.

70
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,874
Hide it. Men have been known
to die of thirst in these cells.

71
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,749
What about my daughters?

72
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,154
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

73
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,747
Even my little birds cannot ﬁnd her.

74
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,951
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

75
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,789
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

76
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,595
all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

77
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,918
You watched my men
being slaughtered and did nothing.

78
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,234
And would again, my lord.

79
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:15,352
l was unarmed, unarrnoured
and surrounded by Lannister swords.

80
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,472
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

81
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,715
What madness led you to tell the queen

82
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,190
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

83
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,391
The madness of mercy.

84
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,550
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.

85
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,751
It's always
the innocents who suffer.

86
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,791
It wasn't the wine
that killed Robert, nor the boar.

87
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,117
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

88
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:51,470
but it was your mercy
that killed the king.

89
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,950
I trust you know you're
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

90
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,471
The queen can't kill me.
Oat holds her brother.

91
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,912
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.

92
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,797
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her ﬁngers.

93
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,915
If that's true,

94
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,911
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

95
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,951
Not today, my lord.

96
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,479
Tell me something, Varys.

97
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,191
Who do you truly seNe?

98
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,914
The realm, my lord.

99
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,991
Someone must.

100
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,391
(Door creaks, clangs)

101
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:01,077
It's Othor, without a doubt.

102
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,395
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord,
less the hand the wolf tore off.

103
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,796
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

104
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,708
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

105
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,354
- Mmm.
- The smell.

106
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,229
(Sniffs) What smell?

107
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,152
There is none.

108
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,795
lf they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

109
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,596
- We should burn them.
- Snovfs not wrong, my lord.

110
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,874
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.

111
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,319
I want Maester Aemon
to unmine them ﬁrst.

112
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,273
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

113
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,111
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

114
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,312
Lord Commander,

115
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,992
Maester Aemon
awaits you in his chambers...

116
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,713
A raven from King's Landing.

117
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,230
Come on, move 'em out.

118
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,116
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

119
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,274
and pour one for yourself.

120
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,154
The king is dead.

121
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,194
Is there any word of my father?

122
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,230
Sit.

123
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,188
Lord Stark has been

124
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:51,957
charged with treason.

125
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,679
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

126
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,597
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

127
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,036
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

128
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,436
Your duty lies here now.

129
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,269
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

130
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,597
I'm sure they'll be

131
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,312
treated gently.

132
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:32,034
(Varys) Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

133
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,913
King Robert's body was still warm

134
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,953
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

135
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,433
He wouldn't do that.

136
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,114
He knows how much
I love Joffrey. He wouldn't.

137
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,030
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

138
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,550
Send for my father. He'll tell you -
the king was his ﬁiend.

139
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,388
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

140
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,875
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

141
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,154
How can I allow you to marry my son?

142
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,034
(Pycelle) A child born of a traitors seed

143
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,355
is no ﬁt consort for our king.

144
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,835
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

145
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,191
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

146
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:14,197
No, I'm not. I'll be
a good wife to him, you'll see.

147
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,512
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.

148
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,075
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

149
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,030
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

150
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,588
(Sighs)

151
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,273
Little dove, you must write to Lady Oatelyn
and your brother, the eldest,

152
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,873
- what's his name?
- Robb.

153
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:41,991
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

154
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,072
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

155
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,272
urge your brother
to keep the king's peace.

156
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,312
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

157
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:02,194
If... If I could see my father,
talk to him about...

158
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:06,030
You disappoint me, child.

159
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,391
We have told you
of your father's treason.

160
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,636
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

161
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,511
| only meant that...

162
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,677
What will happen to him?

163
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,515
- That depends.
- On...

164
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,074
- On what?
- On your brother.

165
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,871
And on you.

166
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,597
Treason?

167
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:42,072
Sansa wrote this?

168
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,474
It is your sister's hand,
but the queen's words.

169
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,393
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

170
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,478
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his arse kissed?

171
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,319
This is a royal command, my lord.

172
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:58,954
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.

173
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,874
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.

174
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,757
But not alone.

175
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,478
Call the banners.

176
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,792
All of them, my lord?

177
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,717
They've all sworn to defend my father,
have they not?

178
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,592
They have.

179
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,756
Now we see
what their words are worth.

180
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,875
Yes.

181
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,071
Are you afraid?

182
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,752
I must be.

183
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,233
Good.

184
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,748
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.

185
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,510
(Oawing)

186
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,997
You've had this since dawn?

187
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,349
He sent it to me, not you.

188
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:14,516
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?l

189
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,631
My husband has been taken prisoner.

190
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,991
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?

191
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,349
Your son against the Lannisters?

192
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,717
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

193
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,832
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

194
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,356
He is your brother by lawl

195
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,317
Does family mean nothing to you?

196
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:38,078
Family means everything to me.

197
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,877
And I will not risk Robin's life

198
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,553
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

199
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,716
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

200
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,598
You just ate.

201
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,398
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?

202
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,029
- But I'm hungryl
- Soon, love, soon.

203
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,031
You're always welcome here, sister.

204
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,153
But if you're asking me
to send men from the Vale to ﬁght...

205
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,310
That is what I ask.

206
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,110
Go on, sweet.

207
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:09,150
Time for your bath.

208
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,589
|'|| feed you after.

209
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,908
If you fear for the safety of your son...

210
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,873
Of course I fear
for the safety of my sonl

211
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,831
Are you an idiot?

212
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,234
They killed my husband.

213
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:27,629
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

214
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,072
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.

215
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,393
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

216
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,033
where they belong,

217
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,230
to protect their lord.

218
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,076
(T yrion whistling a tune)

219
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,195
Will you shut up?

220
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,029
There's hill tribes all around here.

221
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,787
If I'm going to die, it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

222
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,115
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

223
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,752
Eh?

224
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:15,667
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.

225
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,268
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

226
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,670
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

227
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,670
Golden women?

228
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,916
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

229
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,952
for as long as I'm around
and not a moment longer.

230
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,797
But you knew that.

231
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,708
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honour.

232
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,833
Fair enough.

233
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,715
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

234
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,876
and "my lord" you
every time you take a shit.

235
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,595
Though I would treasure
your ﬁiendship,

236
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,752
l'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

237
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,394
And ifthe day ever comes
when you're tempted to sell me out,

238
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,033
remember this -

239
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:00,717
whatever their price,

240
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,318
|'|| beat it.

241
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,435
I like living.

242
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,278
(Whistles)

243
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,916
- (Rustling)
- (Bronn whispers) Tyrion.

244
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,232
Tyrion.

245
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,917
Tyrion.

246
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,677
(Birds chirp, ﬂutter)

247
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,755
Come, share our ﬁre.

248
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,949
Help yourselves to our goat.

249
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,151
When you meet your gods,
you tell them

250
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,633
Shagga, son of Dolf,
of the Stone Crows sent you.

251
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,796
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

252
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,837
How would you like to die,
Tyrion, son of Tywin?

253
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,513
ln myownbed,
attheageofBO

254
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,069
with a belly full of wine
and a girl's mouth around my cock

255
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,111
(Laughing)

256
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,515
(All laughing)

257
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,470
Take the halfrnan.

258
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,432
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

259
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,596
No, no, no, no, nol

260
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,547
My... My house is rich and powerful.

261
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,556
If you see us through these mountains,
my father will shower you with gold.

262
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,988
We have no use
for a halfrnan's promises.

263
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,272
Halfrnan maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

264
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,075
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver

265
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,555
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

266
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,510
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

267
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,309
Good enough for killing sheep,
ifthe sheep don't ﬁght back

268
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,431
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

269
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,112
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

270
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,759
That trinket is worth more
than everything your tribe owns.

271
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,151
But if you help us,
Shagga, son of Dolf,

272
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,349
I will not give you trinkets.

273
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,912
I will give you this.

274
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,237
What is “this"?

275
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,789
The Vale of Arryn.

276
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,992
The lords of the Vale
have always spat upon the hill tribes.

277
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,112
The lords of the Vale want me dead.

278
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,671
I believe it is time
for new lords of the Vale.

279
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,550
(Crow cawing)

280
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:56,116
(Ser Alliser) Now there's a rare sight...

281
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,034
Not only a bastard,
but a traitors bastard.

282
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,547
- Jon, nol
- Jon, stop, put it downl

283
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,876
Blood will always tell.

284
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,830
You'll hang for this, bastard.

285
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,552
I told you not to do anything stupid.

286
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,869
You're conﬁned to quarters. Go.

287
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,909
(Barking, whining)

288
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,471
Ghost, what's wrong?

289
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,311
ls someone out there?

290
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,750
(Whining and growling)

291
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,750
(Snarling)

292
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,151
(Growling)

293
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,350
Commander?

294
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:50,915
(Barks, whines)

295
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,950
Stay.

296
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,149
Hello?

297
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,835
- Who's there?
- (Whines)

298
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,080
- Lord Commander?
- (Door slams)

299
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,911
(Barking)

300
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,270
(Growling)

301
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,151
(Morrnont) Snom

302
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,197
Commanderl

303
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,477
(YEIPS)

304
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:08,071
(Screaming)

305
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,519


306
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,551
(Men yelling, women screaming)

307
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,075
(Grunts)

308
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,112
(Screaming and yelling continue)

309
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,590
What did they do?

310
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,831
Lamb men make good slaves.

311
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,427
Khal Drogo will make a gift
of them to the slavers,

312
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,471
and the slavers will give us gold...

313
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:44,747
...and silk. and steel.

314
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:48,633
(Daenerys) I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

315
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,672
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

316
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,439
ships to sail to Westeros.

317
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,510
(Women screaming)

318
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:12,153
Jorah, make them stop.

319
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,197
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

320
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,710
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

321
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:19,989
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.

322
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,110
The riders do her honour.

323
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,355
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi.

324
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:26,435
I will bring you her tongue.

325
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,118
Princess, you have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

326
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,992
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.

327
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,798
Do as I command
or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.

328
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,998
(Rakharo speaks Dothraki)

329
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,433
- Come.
- (Man speaks Dothraki)

330
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:01,073
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

331
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,475
And those women there.

332
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,710
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

333
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,955
I can,

334
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,797
and I will.

335
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,396
(Man speaks Dothraki)

336
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:19,029
(Dothraki continues)

337
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,798
(Drogo speaks Dothraki)

338
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,914
Moon of my life,

339
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,877
Mago says you haven taken his spoils,

340
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,316
a daughter of a lamb man
who was his to mount.

341
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,113
Tell me the truth of this.

342
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,716
Mago speaks the truth,
my sun and stars.

343
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:47,672
l have claimed many daughters this day...

344
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,233
...so they cannot be mounted.

345
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,592
This is the way of war.

346
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,550
These women are slaves now...

347
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:59,756
...to do with as we please.

348
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,036
It pleases me to keep them safe.

349
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,993
If your riders would mount them,
let them take them for wives.

350
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,034
Does the horse mate with the lamb?

351
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,877
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

352
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,273
You are a foreigner.

353
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:19,355
You do not command me.

354
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:23,188
I am Khaleesi. I do command you.

355
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,435
(Drogo snickers)

356
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,350
See how ﬁerce she grows?

357
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,592
That is my son inside her,
the stallion that will mount the world,

358
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,991
ﬁlling her with his ﬁre.

359
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,997
I will hear no more.

360
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,513
Mago, ﬁnd somewhere else
to stick your cock

361
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,879
A Khal who takes orders
from a foreign whore is no Khal.

362
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,554
(Speaks Dothraki)

363
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,638
(Speaks Dothraki)

364
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,194
I will not have your body burned.

365
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,949
I will not give you that honour.

366
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,356
The beetles will feed on your eyes.

367
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:15,471
The worms will crawl through your lungs.

368
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,070
The rain will fall on your rotting skin...

369
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,513
...until nothing is left of you but bones.

370
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:34,798
First you have to kill me.

371
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,867
I already have.

372
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,590
My sun and stars is wounded.

373
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,597
A scratch...

374
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,232
...moon ofmy life.

375
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,997
Where are the healers?

376
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,951
This is the bite of a ﬂy.

377
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,355
I can help the great rider with his cut.

378
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,192
The Khal needs no help
from slaves who lie with sheep.

379
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,675
She is mine. Let her speak

380
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,711
(Speaks English) Thank you, silver lady.

381
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:23,314
(Speaks English) Who are you?

382
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,398
lam named Mirri Maz Duur.
l was the godswife of this temple.

383
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,668
Witch.

384
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,994
My mother was
godswife here before me.

385
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,792
She taught me how
to make healing smokes and ointments.

386
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,639
All men are of one ﬁock.
so my people believe.

387
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,677
The great shepherd sent me
to earth to heal his...

388
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,829
Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.

389
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,237
Lamb or lion,

390
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:49,233
his wound must be washed
and sewn or it will fester.

391
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,194
Let her clean your wound,
my sun and stars...

392
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,591
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.

393
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,630
(Men chatting)

394
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:22,233
For 30 years I've been making
corpses out of men, boy.

395
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,793
I'm the man you want
leading the vanguard.

396
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,276
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

397
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,871
The bloody wall will melt

398
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,071
before an Umber
marches behind a Glover.

399
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,799
I will lead the van
or I will take my men

400
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,990
and march them home.

401
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,308
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

402
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,273
And when I am done
with the Lannisters,

403
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:55,028
I will march back north,
root you out of your keep

404
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,680
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

405
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,030
Oathbreaker, is it?l

406
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:06,392
I'll not sit here and swallow insults
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

407
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,678
(Snarls)

408
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,268
(Screaming)

409
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,231
(Snap)
(Screams)

410
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,910
My lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

411
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,911
against your liege lord.

412
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,874
But doubtless the Greatjon
only meant to cut my meat for me.

413
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,234
Your meat...

414
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,749
is bloody tough.

415
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,149
(Jon Umber chortles)

416
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,119
(All laughing)

417
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,550
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

418
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:19,711
- Where are you going?
- South. For Father.

419
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,548
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

420
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,071
I don't want them to know
we're coming.

421
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,754
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.

422
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,795
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.

423
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,912
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...

424
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,467
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

425
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,669
Until I return that will be you.

426
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,228
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

427
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,070
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

428
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,116
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can,

429
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,034
but if you don't hear from me,
don't be scared.

430
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,070
Until I return.

431
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,790
How long have you been
hiding out there?

432
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,831
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

433
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,630
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.

434
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,957
Robb will free Father
and they'll come back with Mother.

435
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,950
No, they won't.

436
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,637
(Bran) Please watch over Robb.

437
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,718
And watch over
all the other men from Winterfell.

438
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,869
And Theon too, I suppose.

439
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,590
You hear them, boy?

440
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:09,069
The old gods are answering you.

441
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,351
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.

442
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,637
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only gods.

443
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:22,948
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.

444
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:28,998
Well, your ﬁiend
did put a knife to my throat.

445
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,315
I'm not complaining, little lord,

446
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,350
just telling truths.

447
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:39,709
What did you mean
about hearing the gods?

448
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,957
You asked them,
they're answering you.

449
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,315
Shh.

450
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,637
- Open your ears.
- (Leaves rustling)

451
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,830
It's only the wind.

452
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:58,469
Who do you think
sends the wind if not the gods?

453
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,318
They see you, boy.

454
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,759
They hear you. (Sighs)

455
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,952
Your brother will get
no help from them where he's going.

456
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,548
The old gods have
no power in the South.

457
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,229
The weirwoods there were all
cut down a long time ago.

458
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,791
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

459
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:19,069
(Running footsteps)

460
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,432
(Osha giggles)
Well, there's a big man.

461
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,552
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the queen.

462
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:29,639
- Go back and ﬁnd your clothes, Hodor.
- (Laughs)

463
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,035
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

464
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,116
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

465
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,479
Giants and worse than giants.

466
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:46,074
I tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

467
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,397
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

468
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,431
North, not southl

469
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,875
- The cold winds are rising.
- (Leaves rustling)

470
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,471
They were touched by white walkers.

471
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,750
That's why they came back

472
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,075
That's why their eyes turned blue.

473
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,110
Only ﬁre will stop them.

474
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,476
- How do you know that?
- I read aboutitinabook..

475
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,433
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

476
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,716
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

477
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,031
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

478
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,917
And when they wake up...

479
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:47,516
And when they wake up, what?

480
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,711
I hope the Wall's high enough.

481
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:16,710
(Men chattering in camp)

482
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:26,474
Summer snows, my lady.

483
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,114
Robb's brought the North with him.

484
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,669
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

485
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,076
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a swond Lannister army from the South.

486
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,628
Our scouts conﬁrm
its even larger than the Kingslayer's.

487
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,797
One army or two,
the kings in the North

488
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,434
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

489
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,387
Motherl

490
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,149
You look well.

491
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,114
Lady Oatelyn, you're a welcome sight
in these troubled times.

492
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,032
We had thought not
to meet you here, my lady.

493
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,349
I had not thought to be here.

494
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:14,716
I would speak with my son alone.

495
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,990
I know you will forgive me, my lords.

496
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,190
You heard herl
Move your arsesl

497
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,475
Come on, out.

498
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,393
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deal?

499
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,039
Have no fear, my lady.

500
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,627
We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannisters bunghole

501
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,354
and then it's on
to the Red Keep to free Ned.

502
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,030
- You old devil, Rodrik
- Jon.

503
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,315
You're not wasting away, are you?

504
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,197
I remember the day
you came into this world,

505
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,754
red-faced and squalling.

506
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,799
And now I ﬁnd you leading a host to war.

507
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,519
- There was no one else.
- No one?

508
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,595
Who were those men I saw here?

509
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,598
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

510
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,790
If you think you can
send me back to Winterfell...

511
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:11,114
Oh, would that I could.

512
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:16,194
There was...

513
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,230
a letter.

514
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,675
From Sansa.

515
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,870
From the queen, you mean.

516
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,598
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

517
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,473
How many men do you have?

518
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,431
18,(XX).

519
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,749
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

520
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,633
You would never
be allowed to leave. No.

521
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:59,308
Our best hope,
our only hope,

522
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:03,591
- is that you can defeat them in the ﬁeld.
- And if I lose?

523
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,075
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

524
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:09,271
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

525
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,635
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

526
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,153
And the years have not made him kinder.

527
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:19,435
If you lose,

528
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,348
your father dies, your sisters die,

529
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:25,435
we die.

530
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,708
Well, that makes it simple, then.

531
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,078
I suppose it does.

532
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,716
From here it might be best
if Bronn and I continue alone.

533
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,030
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

534
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,831
Not best for me.

535
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,871
If the halfrnan betrays us,

536
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:09,594
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut off his manhood...

537
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:12,358
And feed it to the goats, yes.

538
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,548
All ﬁght, then.

539
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,630
Time to meet my father.

540
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,275
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

541
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:54,151
Father.

542
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,558
The rumours of your demise
were unfounded.

543
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,875
Sorry to disappoint you.

544
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:04,152
And who are these...

545
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:06,315
companions of yours?

546
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,151
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

547
00:43:11,279 --> 00:43:13,190
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

548
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,513
Timett, son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.

549
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:22,237
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk.

550
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,191
leader of the Black Ears.

551
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,595
And here we have Bronn, son of...

552
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,635
You wouldn't know him.

553
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,435
May I present my lord father,

554
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,068
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

555
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,316
Lord of Oasterly Rock
and Warden of the West?

556
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,274
Kind ofyou to go to war for me.

557
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,951
You left us no choice.

558
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,275
The honour of the house was at stake.

559
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,550
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meeldy.

560
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,995
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

561
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,111
He's braver. I'm better-looking.

562
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,674
He's been covering himself in glory.

563
00:44:02,759 --> 00:44:05,398
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

564
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,229
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Oatelyn Starks homeland.

565
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,157
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

566
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,120
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

567
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,949
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear ﬁiend Ned?

568
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,631
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

569
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:28,154
My sister rules, you mean.

570
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,315
Starks son has called his banners.

571
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,554
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

572
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,309
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

573
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,878
Maybe. Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

574
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,558
You'd like him.

575
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,393
While we're on the subject of war,

576
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,471
I made promises to my ﬁiends here,

577
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,830
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

578
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:57,712
We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,

579
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,831
plus swords, pikes,

580
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:01,711
gorgets, maces. . .

581
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,948
If it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

582
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,435
that the northmen
have crossed the Neck

583
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,950
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws. So be it.

584
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,117
Kevan, command
the drummers beat assembly.

585
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,393
And send word to Jaime
that I am moving against Robb Stark.

586
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,317
At once, my lord.

587
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,472
It is said that the men
of the mountain clans are great warriors.

588
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:39,277
Ride with me against my enemies

589
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:42,072
and you shall have
all my son promised you and more.

590
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,429
Only ifthe halfrnan ﬁghts with us.

591
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,074
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

592
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,479
the little lion's life is ours.

593
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,433
(Rodrik) The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.

594
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,357
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

595
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:06,234
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannisters siege of Riverrun.

596
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,033
Do that and the river lords will join us.

597
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:12,595
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

598
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,951
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerrnan.

599
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,192
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

600
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,909
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

601
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,794
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

602
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,715
(Grunting)

603
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,107
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

604
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,236
So what's it going to be?

605
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,909
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

606
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,470
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

607
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,477
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

608
00:46:55,919 --> 00:46:59,548
- Where did you ﬁnd him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

609
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:01,709
He looked to be counting.

610
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,032
How high did you get?

611
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,038
20,000. Maybe more.

612
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,469
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

613
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,387
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

614
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:29,833
And he understands honour...

615
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:33,315
and courage.

616
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,390
Let him go.

617
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,076
Robb.

618
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,957
Tell Lord Tywin
winter is coming for him.

619
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,272
20,000 northemers marching south
to ﬁnd out if he really does shit gold.

620
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,470
Yes, my lord.

621
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,511
Thank you, my lord.

622
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,269
Are you touched, boy?l
Letting him go?

623
00:48:17,399 --> 00:48:18,957
You call me boy again.

624
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,039
Go on.

625
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:32,995
(Growls)

626
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,791
Oi.

627
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:49,232
(Pycelle) It is also the wish of His Grace

628
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,114
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

629
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,874
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

630
00:48:56,959 --> 00:49:01,396
..be at once raised to the rank of lord...

631
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,754
Lord Gyles.

632
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,031
..and granted
the ancient seat of Harrenhal,

633
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,549
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honour

634
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,356
after him until the end of time.

635
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,755
(Lords mutter)

636
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:21,598
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark.

637
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,833
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

638
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:30,191
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

639
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,432
be appointed Hand of the King.

640
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,351
Lastly,

641
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:38,152
in these times of treason and turmoil,

642
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,151
it is the view of council

643
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:44,191
that the life and safety

644
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,151
of King Joffrey

645
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:50,238
be of paramount importance.

646
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:54,233
Ser Barristan Selmy.

647
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:03,710
Your Grace,
I am yours to command.

648
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,717
Rise, Ser Barristan.

649
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,555
You may remove your helm.

650
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,909
You have served the realm
long and faithfully.

651
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:19,634
Every man and woman
in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.

652
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,911
But it is time to put aside
your armour and your sword.

653
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,679
It is time to rest
and look back with pride

654
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,553
- on your many years of service.
- (Murrnuring)

655
00:50:29,439 --> 00:50:31,828
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

656
00:50:31,959 --> 00:50:36,271
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

657
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:40,028
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

658
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:42,670
(Joffrey) You let my father die.

659
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,519
You're too old to protect anybody.

660
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,316
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

661
00:50:50,399 --> 00:50:52,754
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

662
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,429
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who prohned his blade

663
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,515
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defendl

664
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,436
Careful, ser.

665
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,473
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

666
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:06,994
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

667
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,714
with servants
to look after your every need.

668
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,628
A hall to die in
and men to bury me.

669
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,069
I am a knight.

670
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:21,077
I shall die a knight.

671
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:28,795
A naked knight, apparently.

672
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,791
(Laughter)

673
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,228
Even now I could cut through
the ﬁve of you like carving a kecal

674
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,236
Here, boyl

675
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,874
Melt it down and add it to the others.

676
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,397
(Doors creak. clang)

677
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:09,669
If any man in this hall
has other matters

678
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:13,314
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

679
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,828
or go forth and hold his silence.

680
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:20,591
Your Grace.

681
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:23,630
Come forward, my lady.

682
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,352
(Steward) The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.

683
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,836
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

684
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,799
I do.

685
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,790
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

686
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,348
Lord Eddard Stark.
who was Hand of the King.

687
00:52:44,479 --> 00:52:47,516
Treason is a noxious weed.

688
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,475
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak

689
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,194
I want to hear what she says.

690
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,152
Thank you, Your Grace.

691
00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:58,668
Do you deny your father's crime?

692
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,395
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.

693
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,032
All I ask is mercy.

694
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:07,714
I know my lord father
must regret what he did.

695
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,751
He was King Robert's ﬁiend
and he loved him.

696
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,477
You all know he loved him.

697
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,073
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

698
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:19,794
They must have lied to him -
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.

699
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:21,671
They must have liedl

700
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,111
He said I wasn't the king.

701
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,236
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

702
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:31,192
Maester Pycelle
was giving him milk of the poppy.

703
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,949
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

704
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,836
A child's faith.

705
00:53:38,959 --> 00:53:41,154
Such sweet innocence.

706
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:45,838
And yet they say wisdom
oft comes from the mouths of babes.

707
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,279
Treason is treasonl

708
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,391
Anything else?

709
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,509
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

710
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,598
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

711
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,916
Your sweet words have moved me.

712
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,758
But your father has to confess.

713
00:54:19,879 --> 00:54:23,155
He has to confess
and say that I'm the king...

714
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,955
or there'll be no mercy for him.

715
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,356
He will.
