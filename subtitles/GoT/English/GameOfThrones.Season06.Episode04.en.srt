won't stay in Meereen forever.

182

Her path takes her westward.

183
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,195
When we last met, I offered her ships,

184
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,793
so she could return to Westeros
where she belongs.

185
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,869
She refused them.

186
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,678
She refused them
because hundreds ofthousands

187
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,954
of men, women and children
still lived in chains.

188
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,315

189
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,389

191
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,436
You still follow orders.

192
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,593
Just because your master has silver hair
and tits doesn't mean she's not a master.

There have always been those with
wealth and power and those with nothing.

That is the way ofthe world.
I'm not here to change the way ofthe world.

197
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,907

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,515
You don't need slaves to make money.

199
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,068
There haven't been slaves in Westeros
for hundreds of years,

200
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,037
and I grew up richer than any of you.

201
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:15,873
But our queen recognises that she erred

202
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,431
by abolishing slavery
without providing a new system to replace it.

203
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,555
So, here is the queen's proposal.

204
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,837
Slavery will never return to Meereen,

205
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:30,393
but she will give
the other cities of Slaver's Bay

206
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,232
time to adjust to the new order.

207
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,718
What does that mean?

208
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:36,029
Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,

209
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,355
we will give you seven years
to end the practice.

210
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,832
Slaveholders will be compensated
for their losses, of course, at fair prices.

211
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,118
In exchange, you will cut off your support
for the Sons ofthe Harpy.

212
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,757
We do not support the Sons ofthe Harpy.

213
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,593
Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.

To the king's own mother?

531
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,228
It's all right.

532
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,355
It's done. It's in the past.

533
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,555
And of course,
Margaery's safety is paramount.

534
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,234
You don't like Margaery, do you?

535
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,878
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

536
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,111
Margaery is the queen.

537
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:10,436
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

538
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,318
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

539
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,595
The High Sparrow
has no respect for kings or queens.

540
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,351
No respect for anything in this world.

541
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,158
He has no use for the things ofthis world.

542
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,835
He wants to knock them down,
and replace them with what?

543
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,875
With fantasies.

544
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,678
With beggars in the street.

545
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:31,987

547
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,513
There's something I want to tell you.

548
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:42,111
Something the High Sparrow told me.

549
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,439
You've spoken with him?

550
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,908
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out...

551
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,274
It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly,

552
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,158

You once spoke of your respect for our father

560
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,792
because he understood
the necessity of working with one's rivals.

561

JAIME: Cersei is the mother ofthe king.

565
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,036
She has the king's ear and his trust.

566
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:42,831
And the king has been speaking regularly
with the High Sparrow

567
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:45,114
about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

568
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,190
The High Sparrow seized power
knowing full well

569
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:50,271
we'd bicker amongst ourselves
instead of seizing it back.

570
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,237
Here we are. Well done to us.

571
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,230
Now the future ofthe Seven Kingdoms
rests in his dirty peasant hands.

572
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,351
In a few days, he'll have atrial for me.

573
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,470
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

574
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,950
Yes, Margaery will repent her sins
before the good people ofthe city.

575
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,749
Oh, no.

576
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:12,432
That cannot happen.

577
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,999
That will not happen.

578
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,554
I agree.

579
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,028
You've got
the second largest army in Westeros.

580
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,109
You'll bring them into the city,

581
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,234
stop Queen Margaery's humiliation
before it starts,

582
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,753
and take her back into Crown custody.

583
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,868
The king has ordered me to take no action
against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant

584
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,358
out of fear for the queen's safety.

585
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,270
You will take no action at all.

586
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,828
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

587
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,718
Were you expressly forbidden
from standing down?

588
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,189
No, but ifthe king should call...

589
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:49,112
The whole thing will be over
before anyone can call on you to do anything.

590
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,915
When the High Sparrow is in custody,
or dead, preferably,

591
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:55,593
and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,

592
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,749
do you think
the king will be angry at the outcome?

593
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,507
You hate these fanatics as much as we do.

594
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,589
You hate what they've done to your son.

595
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,228
Do you want Lancel back?
Or have you given him up for good?

596
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,118
Of course I want him back.

597
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:15,388

598

and let the people that took him from you
be destroyed.

the Sparrows have many friends in this city.
